<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar, Senegal - Africa's participation in the Olympics started with South Africa in the 1908 London games, in Britain. Egypt joined that country as Africa's second representative in the 1928 event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 1908 to 1924 South Africa, represented only by its European population, performed well. It gained a medal in the 100-metre London competition in 1908.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four years later in Stokholm, South Africa won the marathon and Ruud Lewis, of the same country, claimed victory in the individual cycling competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African faired even better in 1920 in Antwerp, Belgium. It won gold medals in the men's 4,400-metre, 4x100-metre relay, rowing and boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With much less success in the 1924 Paris Games, the South Africans only won a medal in boxing. At the 1928 Amsterdam Games, the South Africans fared as well as the Egyptians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 110-metre hurdles South Africa's Sydney Atkinson was magnificent as was the Egyptian weightlifter, Sayedd Nosseir, who earned his country's first Olympic medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the two countries remained Africa's only representatives until sub-Saharan countries began to gain independence, mostly in the early 1960s, South Africa performed better than Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vast majority of African countries began participating in the Olympics from this period. The best years for Africa were 1968 in Mexico, 1988 in Seoul, Korea, and 1992 in Barcelona, Spain, where Kenyan runners creamed medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans were expected to do well before Barcelona were it not for the near-absolute boycott of the 1980 Montreal Games and partial participation in the games at Moscow in 1980, Los Angeles in 1984 and Seoul in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 149 medals (47 gold, 48 silver and 54 bronze) won by African countries more than the half were gained in athletics, mostly in track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia's marathon runner, Abebe Bikila, put the stamp on his country's first Olympic appearance of the 60's in Rome, Italy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bikila gained sub-Sahara Africa's first Olympic medal, winning the marathon, in Constantine, Italy. It was here, 30 years earlier, that Italy's first dictator, Benito Mussolini, decided to invade Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bikila's success was the harbinger of other outstanding African Olympians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four years later, he repeated his achievement in Tokyo, Japan, where South Africa was banned from the Olympic movement because of its racially discriminatory policy of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African athletes reached their pinnacle at the 1968 Mexico games.  Kenya's Kipchoge Keino won the 1,500-metre gold. Nine of 16 African medals, three of them gold, were won by Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunisia solidified Africa's lead when Mohamed Gammoudi won the 5,000-metre gold. This came after he won a Certificate of Merit in the mid-long distance event four years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1972 Munich Olympics, African athletes equalled their 16-medals haul of Mexico. The stars, this time, were the Ugandan 400-metre hurdler, John Akii Bua, and Keino, who took the gold in the 3,000-metre steeple chase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Africa progress stopped with the boycott of the 1976 Montreal Games. Only Cote D'Ivoire and Senegal participated. They refused to abide by the call for the boycott made by African countries, in protest against the participation of New Zealand which had relations with apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four years later in Moscow some 20 African countries, among them Kenya, the driving force of African athletics, followed a U.S.-led boycott in protest against the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia, then a close ally of the Soviet Union, took part in the games.  Mirus Yfter won gold medals in the 5,000-metre and 10,000-metre races. These games were the first in which Africa won a medal in a collective event: Zimbabwean women's field hockey team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a tit-for-tat, the Soviets refused to take park in the 1984 Los Angeles Games supported, also, by few African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, those African states which participated won 13 medals, three of them gold. Kenya won just one gold medal, courtesy of Julius Korir in the 3,000-metre steeple chase. That was Kenya's poorest performance since 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morocco won two gold medals with Said Aouita in the men's 5,000-metre in 13 minutes, 21 seconds and Nawal El Moutawakil on the women's 400-metre hurdles in 54.61 seconds, the first individual victory of an African woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the country's first Olympic winning, Gabriel Tiacoh of Cote D'Ivoire got the 400-metre men's gold while Zambia and Algeria won medals in boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia was the only African nation to boycott the 1988 Seoul Games.  The Kenyans bounced back from their slump with four gold medals won by Paul Ereng in the 800-metres, Peter Rono in the 1,500-metres, John Ngugi in the 5,000-metres and Julius Kariuki in the 3,000-metre steeple chase. The late Rober Wangila won gold in boxing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's other gold was won by Moulay Brahim Boutayeb, 21, of Morocco.  Virtually unknown before the competition, he upset Kenya, the 10,000-metre favourites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Cote D'Ivoire four years earlier, Senegal gained its first Olympic medal when hurdler El Hadji Amadou Dia Ba won the silver, ahead of America's Edwin Moses, in the 400-metre hurdles. Africa won 14 medals in Seoul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992, in Barcelona, where virtually all of Africa was represented, women athletes stole the show. Hassiba Boulmerka became Algeria's first Olympic gold medalist. She won the 1,500-metre event. Ethiopia's Derartu Tulu was winner of 10,000-metre in an epic duel with Elena Meyer, the most talented representative and symbol of the post-apartheid South Africa. That country was reintegrated into the Olympic fold after 28 years of isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan athletes performed less well than usual. They carried away two gold medals won by William Tanui in the 800-metre event and by Matthew Birir in the 3,000-metre steeple chase. Kenya lost the 10,000-metre to Morocco's Khalid Skah and accused the Moroccans of unfairly helping each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its maiden Olympic appearance, Namibia's Frankie Fredericks won silver medals in the 100-metre and 200-metre races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In soccer, Ghana became the first African team to finish among the top three, winning the bronze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, Barcelona marked Africa's best Olympic performance. The continent hauled 25 medals: five gold, 13 silver, seven bronze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, all eyes are on Atlanta.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos, Nigeria - Trading slowed at the Nigerian stock market last week, amid cautious moves by investors. Although the all-share index rose by 14.4 points in the week ending on June 21, compared to 28.72 points gained in the previous week, brokers attributed the cautious trend to uncertain signals from the oil marketing sector. Recent trading results showed declining earnings and rising inventories, the analysts said. The volume and value of shares also dipped in comparison to the previous week's performance. Traded shares totalled 11.4 million, down from 11.7 million in the week before, while value fell to 100.9 million naira from 124.6 million naira (1 U.S.  dollar = 81 naira). The number of deals, however, rose to 1,187 from 929 in the week in review. Most shares traded on the Lagos floor were in the banking sector, where some 1.9 million shares worth 9.7 million naira changed hands in 170 deals. The automobile sector, with 6.3 million shares valued at 80.2 million naira in 19 deals, were traded in the week in review. Price movements were moderated by the cautious pricing of oil marketing equities following a recent disappointing first quarter result by Mobil. The sector, usually the toast of the Nigerian market, witnessed few gains in the week. Nigerian Bottling Company, gained the most, adding 77 kobo to close at 22.00 naira (1 naira = 100 kobo). TEXACO and Lever Brothers followed with 51 kobo and 45 kobo respectively. TEXACO finished at 20.66 naira while Lever Brothers ended at 22.25 naira. West African Portland Cement and ATT were adjusted for the payment of dividend and bonus shares in the week just ended. They shed 8.20 naira and 5.89 naira respectively to close at 23.30 naira and 8.11 naira.  Wema Bank lost 50 kobo to 5.50 naira because of brokers' reaction to a recent robbery in one of its branches involving 36 million naira. But United Bank for Africa and Nigerian Breweries slid due to their excess shares flooding the market. The bank fell by 20 kobo to 5.65 naira, while the troubled brewer ended at 15.20 naira.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra, Ghana - The Ashanti Goldfields Campany of Ghana bounced back on the stock exchange Monday, regaining the 2,000 cedis it lost last Friday, to close at 31,000 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AGC's gain helped to propel the Ghana Stock Exchange All-Share index up by 4.98 points to 362.95 points, from Friday's close of 357.97 points.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts said the company's loss on Friday, which came only a few days after it presented its quarterly report, was due to a slip in the world market price of gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Total market capitalisation appreciated slightly from last week's 3,022.80 billion cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the broader market, AGC gained 2,000 cedis to close at 31,000 cedis, while SSB gained five cedis at 865 cedis. Unilever lost one cedi at 829 cedis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All equities except CFAO, Fan Milk Limited, Ghana Commercial Bank, Guinness Ghana Limited, and UTC-Estates, had negative pressures on their prices as supply exceded demand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar, Senegal - The Zambian kwacha has continued to depreciate, selling Tuesday at 1,325 for one U.S. dollar, from some 1,259 previously. Officials attribute the decline to decreased foreign currency inflows and uncertainty triggered by the current political crisis in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial analysts said Tuesday in Lusaka that limited proceeds from copper, the country's major foreigner exchange earner, had also contributed to the scarcity of foreign currencies on the local market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However the CFA franc, used in 13 French-speaking African countries, remained fairly stable this week, opening Tuesday at the nominal rate of 519.3 to the dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Dakar, the currency exchanged at 504 (buying) and 534 (selling) to one greenback. On the same day last week, the currency exchanged at the rate of 505 (buying) and 521 (selling).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire - Donor countries have pledged some 420 million additional funds for the replenishment of the African Development Fund, the soft loan affiliate of the African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank said Tuesday, at its Abidjan headquarters in Cote D'Ivoire, that the amount was promised by 16 of the 24 non-African shareholders of the bank when they met Friday in Osaka, Japan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos, Nigeria - Former Nigerian military ruler Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down in August 1993, has ruled himself out of his country's politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida cancelled Nigeria's June 1993 presidential election, plunging his country into political turmoil, which lingers on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have no interest to go into politics or be lured into it,&quot; he said in a rare interview with journalists at his home in Minna, northern Nigeria Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida, whose eight-year rule ended in an aborted Third Republic after he annulled the presidential poll, dismissed as baseless press reports that he wanted to float a political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have already had my time,&quot; he said, adding that he had chosen to be &quot;a good citizen of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I will continue to pray and encourage the current efforts of the present government towards successful transition to civilian rule,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida has remained out of the limelight since he stepped aside Aug.  26, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lame duck interim civilian administration he installed after annulling the presidential election suddenly resigned Nov. 17, 1993. It was replaced by the current military regime of Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha, a key figure in the Babangida regime, is implementing a 36-month transition to democracy program expected to end in October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime has come under intense international pressure over Nigeria's troubled march to democracy and a poor human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politician Moshood Abiola, who claimed victory in the presidential election cancelled by Babangida, is in detention awaiting trial for treasonable felony after he defiantly declared himself president in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brushing aside local and international appeals for his release, Abacha has insisted that Abiola's trial will go ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos, Nigeria - The Nigerian military administration has released four more detained opposition members, raising the number to six in the last three days, pro-democracy groups said in Lagos Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fred Eno, personal assistant to detained politician Moshood Abiola, was among those freed Monday, according to his family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was detained in August 1994 shortly after the beginning of Abiola's treason trial, for proclaiming himself president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also released were two leaders of the banned National Association of Nigerian Students, Hilary Ojukwu and Charles Titiloye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Civil rights activist Mathew Popoola has also regained his freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freed earlier were Abdul Oroh of the Civil Liberties Organisation and Tunji Abayomi, lawyer to former Nigerian military ruler, Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obasanjo is serving term along with 39 others implicated in a 1995 coup plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release of two other detainees, Chima Ubani and Nosa Igiebor, editor of the weekly &quot;Tell&quot; magazine has not been confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, presidential adviser Awalu Yadudu has dismissed the suggestion that the release had anything to do with ongoing London talks between Nigeria and the Commonwealth. The organisation suspended Nigeria last November over alleged human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yadudu said the latest Nigerian move was in response to the &quot;reconciliatary&quot; approach by the United Nations, which recently sent a fact-finding mission to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. mission's report recommended political and judicial reforms in Nigeria, but refrained from calling for more sanctions against the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the Abacha regime's 36-month transition to democracy program, criticised by opposition, seemed genuine.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe - Zambian said Friday it will not allow the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Security Summit scheduled for Friday in Botswana to specifically discuss rising political tension in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Minister Christon Tembo also told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency, ZIANA, in Harare, that Zambian President Frederick Chiluba would not attend the summit called by SADC chairman, Ketumile Masire, after a series of recent bomb blasts blamed on supporters of former President Kenneth Kaunda rocked Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda and his supporters are protesting new constitutional amendments effectively barring the former president from contesting in presidential elections scheduled for October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You don't put other countries on the agenda,&quot; he said, responding to questions after delivering a letter from Chiluba and discussing with President Robert Mugabe for over an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will be a SADC meeting but not specifically on Zambia,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 12-member SADC recommended in January the setting up of a body to monitor the security situation in Southern Africa and the Botswana summit on Friday will implement the plan with the situation in Zambia, seen as potentially explosive, being the first case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Zambian government, facing mounting criticism at home and abroad, is reluctant to have the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security interfere with its internal problems. Therefore, Zambia has mounted a diplomatic offensive to head off this possibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo, who was accompanied by former foreign minister Vernon Mwaanga, also ruled out the possibility of the on-coming Yaounde summit of the Organisation of African Unity discussing Zambia's political problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of prior engagements, Tembo said, Chiluba would not attend the SADC security summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But he will be well-represented,&quot; Mwaanga, founder-member of the ruling Movementy for Multiparty Democracy, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD ousted Kaunda in the first pluralist elections in decades held in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwaanga was forced to resign as foreign minister after he was implicated in a drug scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambian delegation is also expected to visit Botswana Tuesday where the SADC Secretariat officially announced the summit to be held at the Botswana National Productivity Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The SADC leaders will also review developments in the region and internationally, with particular emphasis on matters relating to politics, defence and security in Southern Africa,&quot; the secretariat said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbabane, Swaziland - Schoolchildren in Swaziland flocked back to classes Tuesday as schools re-opened after a 10-day closure, but some teachers sent them home saying they were waiting union notification that their strike was over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The teachers, along with the country's civil servants whose association executive decided to strike as from Friday, are demanding an 18 percent salary increase. The government has offered 9.9 percent, in line with the infation rate, plus about 4 percent in allowances. The Industrial Court ordered Monday the Swaziland National Association of Teachers and the civil servants to restrain, immediately, from their strike. The court said the action violated their collective agreements with government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the court's instruction, Education Minister Solomon Dlamini announced Monday the reopening of schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a survey Tuesday showed most schools in the capital Mbabane and surrounding districts reported back to normal, children arriving at several schools in the capital and in the city of Manzini were reported to have been sent home by their teachers. They say they will not teach until officially informed by their asociation executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The association's deputy secretary general, Musa Dlamini, told PANA that the teachers' class boycott would not be lifted by the association's executive until a mandate was received from the teachers at a mass meeting.  This, he said, would be called only after Friday, when the association has been ordered to appear before the Industrial Court to show cause why the court order should not be made final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of boarding students are travelling long distances back to their schools and may be stranded if they find the doors still closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can only keep our fingers crossed and hope the government is aware of this possibility,&quot; Dlamini said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was referring to demonstrations last week by members of the unofficial Swaziland Association of Students and Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions. These bodies were demanding that schools be reopened despite the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dlamini said the teachers had nothing to do with either of those organizations, which appear to be exploiting the teachers' strike for their own ends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum, Sudan - Sudan's foreign affairs minister, Ali Osman Mohamed Tahq, said Tuesday that the meeting between the presidents of his country and Egypt, during the recent Arab Summit in Cairo, was a decisive turn for the better in the relations between the two states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporting to the National Assembly, he said both leaders had reaffirmed their desire &quot;to bypass the era of tension and conflict (and move) to an era of cooperation and concord that realizes the interests of the two sides.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt and Sudan have been at loggerheads for years over a number of issues. The most grave of these has been Egypt's accusation that Sudan harbours Muslim militants trying to depose Mubarak's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tension escalated in June 1995 when Mubarak accused Khartoum of being behind the attempt to kill him when he arrived in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to attend a summit of the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Omar Hassan El Bashir, the Sudanese leader, attended the Arab summit last week convened in Egypt. His lengthy meeting with Mubarak ended in an agreement for the extradition of criminals, news reports said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tahq said he expected the meetings between security and political officials of the two countries to be held in the near future. This would be a follow up to the security agreement and an opportunity to improve bilateral relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is hoped that the coming days will witness bilateral meetings at the level of security and political and other executive organs in the two countries to discuss and tackle matters in keeping with the spirit of rapproachement and cooperativeness that dominated the meeting of the two presidents,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg, South Africa - A large number of police and defense force troops have been deployed throughout South Africa's troubled Kwazulu-Natal province in readiness for Wednesday's local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The combined force of more than 25,000 -- with another 5,000 on standby -- will make an all-out effort to ensure that the recent drop in political violence continues, as close to four-million people cast their votes at some 3,300 polling booths throughout the province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provincial police spokesman Bala Naidoo is confident. &quot;All indications are that we are heading for a peaceful election,&quot; he said. &quot;Things are looking good, and we hope they stay that way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that every single polling booth would be manned by policemen, and that no weapons of any description would be allowed into polling areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuesday was quiet after campaigning had officially ended at midnight Monday. According to South African law, no political party is allowed to campaign on the day before an election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two main players, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the African National Congress, closed their campaigns Monday in a spirit of peace and goodwill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said: &quot;This is a time for torelance and reconcialation. It is a time for us to hope that at long last we are leaving this vale of misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day before the polls, the interim electoral commission organising the elections declared 18 candidates unopposed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the 18 were prime minister Kintu Musoke and six ministers whose opponents either withdrew or were technically disqualified from the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Yoweri Museveni, the incumbent, on May 9 won the presidential elections with 75.5 of the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the country's disabled persons elected their five representatives to the next parliament at polls held Tuesday at Seeta near Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the representatives was a blind female teacher, Baba Diri Margaret and a deaf, Alex Ndeezi, a social science student from Makerere University.  They were chosen by an electoral college of disabled people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four of those elected will represent the four regions of Uganda and one will represent disabled women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disableds' electoral college was composed of 156 voters from the 39 districts of Uganda. There were four delegates from each district. The college comprised 36 blind people, 37 deaf and 78 physically handicapped people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first time, since independence in 1962, that Uganda organised elections for the disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda last held parliamentary elections in 1980. The results of the Commonwealth-observed polls were widely disputed by the contesting parties, including Museveni's Uganda People's Movement (UPM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni went to the bush to wage a five-year guerilla war, which eventually led to the overthrow of the military government</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg, South Africa - The first democratic local government elections in South Africa's Kwazulu-Natal province encountered a variety of problems from the moment they took off Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polling stations in the cities were opened on time but reports from various rural areas said there were delays there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election helpline was also besieged by callers complaining that their names were not on the voters' roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were also reports of intimidation and some violence. A polling station at Umlazi, near Durban, was forced to close following allegations of intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scuffles between supporters of the two main parties -- the Inkatha Freedom Party and the African National Congress -- were reported at some stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to four million voters were expected to have cast their ballots at 3,300 polling booths throughout the province by the close of voting Wednesday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A combined defence and police task force of almost 25,000 was deployed throughout the province to ensure free and peaceful polling.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka, Zambia - The United States president, Bill Clinton, has nominated Arlene Render, a career diplomat, as new ambassador to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She will take over from Roland Kuchel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from the U.S. embassy in Lusaka said Wednesday that Render currently directs the Office of Central African Affairs at the U.S.  Department of State. She had previously served as ambassador to Gambia and as deputy chief of mission in Ghana and Congo. She has also worked in Cote d'Ivoire, Jamaica, Italy and Iran. Testifying in favour of her nomination before the Senate Africa Sub-Committee in Washington on June 20, Render said that if confirmed she planned to work hard to &quot;encourage&quot; Zambia in its current democratization process and advance United States interests in the country. Her appointment still has to be confirmed by the U.S. senate. Render told the committee that recent actions by the Zambian government threatened to seriously damage the electoral process and weaken the country's new democracy. She was referring to the current problems created by the adoption by President Frederick Chiluba's government of a new constitution that bars citizens with parents born outside Zambia from contesting this year's presidential elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States early this month demanded an immediate withdrawal of the disputed citizenship clause in the constitution and threatened to withhold bilateral aid if this was not done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator Nancy Kassebaum, who chaired the June 20 senate sub-committee hearing, used the occasion to question the Zambian government's commitment to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was quoted as saying that it was &quot;a real sorrow&quot; and &quot;a disappointment&quot; to see the recent anti-democractic development in Zambia which, she said, had the potential for great wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States had earlier held Zambia as &quot;a model of democracy in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other donors have threatened to withold aid if the Zambian government does not reverse the constitutional changes barring first generation Zambians from contesting presidential election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LONDON - After meeting for two days with a Nigerian government delegation, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group has decided to suspend its recommendation for sanctions on Nigeria, the News Agency of Nigeria reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of the group, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stanley Mudenge, said in a press conference Tuesday that the meeting with the Nigerians was fruitful, the agency reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, Mudenge said, the group has decided to &quot;hold in reserve&quot; the measures it had agreed to take against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In April this year the group recommended that Commonwealth member nations should, in addition to other measures like visa restriction, cut-off airlinks with Nigeria and freeze the personal assets of members of the Nigerian military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mudenge, who read the communique on behalf of the participants, said that both parties &quot;agreed that the constructive dialogue which had taken place needed to be continued.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group had raised issues of concern to the Commonwealth with the 17-man Nigerian delegation and, in turn, had had received a briefing on developments in Nigeria since November, when the country was suspended from the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mudenge said that the the ministerial group was impressed with the issues raised by the delegation and that the group would think about them before the next meeting, on date yet to be fixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's foreign affairs minister, Tom Ikimi, said that the dialogue had &quot;broken the impasse&quot; between Nigeria and the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said, Canada had disagreed with the suspension of punishment for Nigeria, instead insisting on implementing the measures recommended by the group in April.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Hearing began Thursday in Lusaka of an appeal against the continued detention of eight Zambian opposition party members for treason, with High Court Judge Peter Chitengi condemning the police for harassing their sympathisers outside the courtroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the trial against senior members of former President Kenneth Kaunda's United national Independence Party (UNIP) got underway, defence lawyer Patrick Mvunga claimed the police had beaten up people and that some had to be taken to hospital for treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mvunga said it was wrong for the police to beat up UNIP cadres while the treason trial was taking place, as if the court building was a barracks or military camp.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 500 policemen were deployed at the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This may be an embarrassment to the defence lawyers that these acts are taking place within the courts buildings. It is important that senior policemen who appreciate law and order are invested in maintaining order,&quot; Mvunga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, Chitengi ordered a senior police officer to report to him about the incident outside the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope you will see that there is order because I will not proceed with the confusion outside the courts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses said that besides beating some UNIP members the police also beat a photographer for the government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper. The police were reported to have arrested some UNIP cadres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier one of the detainees, Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta, told the court that police had searched his Lusaka home on June 3 with a warrant indicating that they were looking for seditious materials, guns and explosives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said nothing was found at his home and office. Yeta said he was later asked to accompany the officers to the police station where he was detained after a female police officer told him that they had been ordered to arrest him on a charge of conspiracy to commit a felony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cross-examined by Mvunga, Yeta was asked whether it was possible he planted a bomb at State House on May 16. Yeta said it was impossible since that day he was attending meetings by opposition party presidents, who were preparing for a conference with ambassadors and high commissioners accredited to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My lord, the charge does not mention other people apart from my other seven colleagues of planting bombs. And to my knoweledge since I have been in detention from June 3, there were bomb explosions on June 5 at Limson House in Lusaka, June 6 at the airport and June 10 in Mufulira,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other accused, UNIP Central Commitee member Rabbison Chongo, denied planting the bomb at State House. He said he left the same day in the company of Kaunda for a conference in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even the day when the bomb was said to be planted at Intercontinental Hotel, I was in Canada and it is physically impossible for me to have planted the bomb as I can only be in one place at a time,&quot; Chongo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the judge that he feared the current detention could be a repeat of what happened in 1993 when he was arrested and detained for two months without trail in connection with what was known as &quot;Zero Option.&quot; Purportedly, this was a plot by UNIP to topple Chiluba government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court is hearing an appeal by the eight treason accused against continued detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos, Nigeria - The University of Lagos has announced that classes will resume July 1, in spite of a strike by the country's university teachers which entered its 78th day Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The university, which concluded its sessional examinations and went on vacation in May after the strike called on April 9 by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), said in a statement Thursday that lectures should resume July 1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASUU launched the strike to press for better pay for its members and adequate funding of Nigerian universities, based on the review of a 1992 agreement with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But negotiations between the Union and the military government collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government accused the ASUU executives of causing academic disharmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It then banned the Union, froze university teachers' pay nationwide and gave lecturers of the country's estimated 40 universities an ultimatum to return to work or risk being fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government also directed that further negotiations were to continue with individual universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ultimatum given to the universities to resume lectures expired July 18, but most of the schools are still shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, ASUU's law suit challenging the government ban came up for hearing at a Lagos court Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the suit filed on behalf of its national president, Asisi Asobie, the Union asked the court to declare the government action illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ASUU's lawyer, Olasupo Ojo, told the high court that government was not represented Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case was then adjourned till July 5, to enable the respondents -- the education and justice ministers -- to be properly served with the notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers are concerned that the delay in resolving the crisis could harm higher education in Nigeria, which suffered months of academic disruptions in 1992/93 over prolonged teachers' strikes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar, Senegal - Athletics is a discipline in which Africa has always occupied a respectable position during previous Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African athletes are again expected to perform well during the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics, even if in Barcelona, where the last games were held in 1992, they won only five medals, one less than in Seoul, in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, things have changed since Barcelona, if one goes by the good performance from the continent's athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven world records are currently held by African runners. These are Algeria's Nourredine Morceli (1,500m, 1,000m, 2,000m and 3,000m), Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia (5,000m and 10,000m) and Kenya's Moses Kiptanui (3,000m Steeple chase).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These performances raise the hope for a higher medal harvest in Atlanta, Georgia, where Namibia's Frank Fredericks is also expected to be among the continent's star performers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Barcelona, Fredericks won silvers in the 100m and 200m sprints. The time of 9.96 secs in the 100m Fredericks registered during an international meet in France last month was clear testimony that he is in great form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the sprints, the continent will also count on Nigeria's Davidson Ezinwa, Africa's record-holder in the 100m (9. 94 secs), and his twin brother Osmond, who are even better than Fredericks in that race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides the twins, Olapade Adeniken and the newcomer Deji Aliu are also tough sprinters who can be relied upon in the United States. With this crop of sprinters, Nigeria is a likely candidate for a medal in the 4 X 100 relay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It might be difficult for African runners to beat the Americans in the 400m sprint. However, surprises could come from Nigeria's Sunday Bada and Samson Kitur of Kenya, currently the continent's best in that discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans are expected to have an easier task in the medium and long distance races, ranging from the 800m and 1000m to the 3,000m steeple chase.  In these, Kenyan, Ethiopian, Algerian and Moroccan athletes are expected to put up a stiff fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Kenya failed to win honours in the 800m for the first time in history during the 1995 world championships at Goteborg, Sweden, it is expected to field new athletes to repair the damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi's Arthemon Hatungimana, last years's world number two in the race, is another hope for a medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1,500m race, Africa's hopes for a gold are even higher. It can count on the strength of Nourredine Morceli, the young Moroccan Hichem El Guerrouj and his compatriot Rachid Labsir, the Burundian Venuste Niyongambo and the Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morceli, the three-time world champion, should be particularly motivated to win his first Olympic title. Sick during Barcelona 1992, he came 7th in the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 5,000m and 10,000m, the continent's hopes will be pinned on the Ethiopian Haile Gebreselassie, the holder of two world records. He is expected to add an Olympic title to his credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian will try to perform better than the Moroccan Khalid Skah, Olympic champion in the 10,000m in Barcelona and Salah Hissou and the Kenyans Ismael Kirui (two times 5,000m world champion.) There will also be Paul Tergat and William Sigei, both two times world cross country champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Africa also stands high medal chances in the 400m hurdles and 3000m steeplechase, which has been monopolised by Kenyans since the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico. In Barcelona, four years ago, Kenya placed three athletes on the podium in that discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The East Africans are expected to maintain their lead in this discipline by fielding Moses Kiptanui, the three time world champion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 400m hurdle, Zambia's Samuel Matete, Africa's record-holder (47 seconds 10) and world champion in 1991, will face an array of tough American hurdlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another field where Africa has some hope is the pole vault with South Africa's Okkert Brits. He is the third person to cross the six meter barrier.  The two others are Ukraine's Segei Burka and Russia's Rodion Gatauline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also hope for improvement among Africa's women athletes, who won two gold medals in Barcelona. Maria Mutola of Mozambique is expected to do well in the 800m. She should have won a medal at the world championship last year but was disqualified for crossing into another runner's lane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Algerian Hassiba Boulmerka, the African athlete with the highest number of medals at the world championship (two medals), is expected to put up a stiff fight to defend the gold medal she won in Barcelona in the 1,500m.  Her major challengers are expected to be the Chinese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa will also count on the Ethiopian woman athlete, Derartu Tulu, the 10,000m champion in Barcelona, although she faces a stiff challenge from the Portuguese Ribeiro, who beat her during last year's world championship. Other medal prospects lie within the crop of middle distance runners Kenya is expected to field.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe - Southern African leaders are expected to launch on Friday a body to monitor defence and security matters, amid a political crisis in Zambia and a border dispute between Botswana and Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organ is to be launched during an emergency summit of the 12-nation Southern African Community (SADC), to be held in Gaborone, Botswana, where the leaders will to ratify an agreement setting up the sub-regional body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will take place as Zambia teeters on the brink of civil conflict after the government enacted laws barring certain categories of Zambians, including former President Kenneth Kaunda, from standing for president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new body will replace the &quot;Frontline States&quot; grouping, currently chaired by Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, which handled such issues during the struggle against apartheid in Namibia and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a draft agreement prepared by SADC foreign ministers in January this year in Windhoek, Namibia, the proposed body will operate at both ministerial and summit level with the chairmanship rotating annually on a troika basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries in the SADC are Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement from the SADC secretariat in Gaborone said the new body would provide a framework for co-ordination of security, defence and political matters in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The SADC leaders will also review developments in the region and internationally, with particular emphasis on matters relating to politics, defence and security,&quot; read the statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several bombs, allegedly planted by Kaunda's supporters, and violent demonstrations have hit Zambia since President Frederick Chiluba signed into law the constitutional amendment which bars first generation Zambians from standing in the forthcoming presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the amendment, Kaunda is disqualified because he has already served more than two terms as president and his parents came from neighboring Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The security organ, to have a wide mandate including military intervention where necessary, is being set up in a region which despite being on the brink of peace for the first time in decades, has several simmering points which may erupt into violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its immediate problems also include instability in Swaziland, where the powerful monarch, King Mswati II, is resisting demands for democratic changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a sign of the worsening relations between Botswana and Namibia, Windhoek's foreign minister, Theo-Ben Gurirab recently described Botswana's military build-up near the disputed island of Kasikili/Sidudu on the Chobe river as &quot;provocative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tension between the two countries has worsened with reports that Botswana planned to upgrade its combat capability with the acquisition of modern fighter jets and main battle tanks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, who along with Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Botswana's Ketumile Masire, helped defuse the crisis in Lesotho, will join other SADC leaders in Gaborone on his way from an investment summit in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Chiluba whose country's crisis precipitated the emergency summit, will not attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian Foreign Minister Lt.Gen. Christon Tembo, on a diplomatic offensive to play down the crisis and stress his country's sovereignty, said Chiluba had prior engagements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg, South Africa - The first democratic local government elections in South Africa's troubled Kwazulu-Natal province ended in peace late Wednesday night. No major incidents of violence were reported throughout the day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a news conference in Durban Wednesday night, provincial police and defence force chiefs, Chris Serfontein and Chris le Roux, praised the 25,000-member combined force which had prevented widespread intimidation and helped ensure peaceful elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are very thankful to say it has been a relatively quiet day and incident-free election,&quot; said Gen. Serfontein. He added that a few minor incidents had been reported, but none of a serious nature. A number of voters had been escorted out of some volatile areas and there had been minor skirmishes between rival groups at some polling stations. The two main contenders in the electrion are the African National Congress and the Inkhata Freedom Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, voting was orderly in most areas, despite widespread registration and logistical problems. Security force patrols remained on duty in most parts of the province after the polls closed at 22:00 local time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general opinion Thursday was that reconciliation between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party had been the main force behind the peaceful election climate. Hundreds of thousands of voters streamed to the more than 3,000 polling stations throughout the province to cast their ballots. A voter turnout of more than 50 percent was anticipated.  Preliminary results have started coming in, but the final picture of the Kwazulu-Natal local government elections is not likely before Friday or even Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra, Ghana - A group of African leaders meeting in Ghana have expressed disappointment at the low direct foreign investment in the continent despite the adoption of investor-friendly policies by most countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a summit in Accra Wednesday night, the leaders said they were seeking partnerships and not aid from the developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit, attended by presidents Jerry Rawlings (Ghana), Apha Konare (Mali), Sam Nujoma (Namibia), and Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe) as well as South African first vice president Thabo Mbeki, was part of an international conference on reviving private investment in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit also brought to the fore Africa's shortcomings in attracting investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some leaders, including Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, were sceptical about how much African economies should be opened up without sacrificing national sovereignty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not asking for welfare,&quot; said host President Jerry Rawlings, &quot;because we have appropriate skills to do a lot of things for ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings said privatising crucial sectors such as telecommunications could be retrogressive as most government bills would be inflated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not everyone who goes into telecommunications for economic reasons,&quot; agreed Mugabe. &quot;Some want to have their ears everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe warned that some investors expected to control economies and politics of countries in which they invested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to look at whether the role of investment is for the development of economies or to extend political control,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe and Rawlings emphasised that investment should be based on partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Alpha Konare of Mali said Africa should build her economic capacity through &quot;friendship and partnership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investor representatives said economic policies in Africa should be fine-tuned to match the conducive environment which had been created by recent advances toward more open economies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said governments should review tariffs to bolster international trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bureaucracy and rigid foreign currency regulations should be scrapped, said the representatives from Britain, Malaysia and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's first vice-president, Thabo Mbeki, said the governments of developed countries should show confidence in the continent's economies first, if their business people are to be convinced there is a future in investing in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A volatile interest rate climate is not conducive to long-term investment planning, either by individuals or big business. And while the surprise rate cut by Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa) this week -- closely followed by the other leading banks -- is welcome, it is not entirely convincing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absa made the move because conditions in the money market had stabilised; the liquidity problem had dissipated -- for the moment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where is the proof, in the form of concrete data, that the capital outflows have come to a standstill? Or that the easing in the money market shortage is more permanent, thereby lending credibility to a rate cut?&quot; asks an analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The banks were very quick to raise their rates six weeks ago and in retrospect they could be accused of having acted too hastily. &quot;On a 16-year trend, their margins were not that out of line,&quot; says a banking analyst.  &quot;They did themselves no favours by acting when they did, alienating many of their customers as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But hindsight is an exact science, says Steven Nathan, banking analyst at Ivor Jones. &quot;They certainly did face a severe liquidity crunch and their earnings were under pressure. Nobody wants higher rates; they lead to bad debts and hit costs. People forget that banks also have to look after their shareholders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reserve Bank helped matters further by halving the rate it charges for &quot;second-tier&quot; loans to the banks, thus providing a buffer should the liquidity situation deteriorate again. Its move came as an even greater surprise than Absa's, but with credit demand easing, the pressure for punitive rates to regulate the money supply and ultimately dampen the inflation rate is receding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Reserve Bank has made sure that external conditions are easier, but that is not the same as saying capital flows have turned positive,&quot; says First National Bank's chief economist, Cees Bruggemans. &quot;While portfolio investors were active in May and June, the net result was negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the first hike in interest rates, evidence of a slowdown in the economy has been growing. The latest Reserve Bank quarterly bulletin points to a decline in domestic demand for the first time since mid-1993. Total real gross domestic expenditure fell by 1,5% in the January to March period, as inventories were run down and private consumption slowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus, the conflict between domestic demands and external realities is hotting up. One school of thought is that the reaction to the falling rand was overdone, but it is not clear that sentiment really has turned around sufficiently to withstand further upheavals in the financial markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has certainly been working hard at promoting its new growth strategy, trumpeting privatisation and offering reassurances on exchange controls. But are the financial managers convinced?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For the sake of consumers and potential investors, we must make sure this interest rate cut sticks,&quot; says the analyst. &quot;We can't afford a reversal in the few weeks' or months' time; the blow to confidence will be immense.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial market reaction to the bank's move was promising -- the R150 bond rate fell 15 points to around 15,04%, with talk of 15% in the near future, as foreign buyers piled in. The money market call rate, however, was stubbornly steady at 16 to 16,25%, signalling tight cash conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Jay Naidoo is embroiled in his first major controversy as post, telecommunications and broadcasting minister after he made &quot;secret&quot; eleventh-hour changes to the Telecommunications Bill accepted by Cabinet last week. Stakeholders accuse him of reneging on consensus painstakingly built over more than a year by his predecessor, Pallo Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The version of the Bill accepted by Cabinet differs significantly from the Telecommunications White Paper -- the pinnacle of Jordan's two-year incumbency -- which was approved by Cabinet in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian has learnt that Willie Currie, the adviser Naidoo inherited from Jordan and who drove the wide-ranging Green Paper and White Paper policy consultations, resigned in protest this week. Key pillars of Jordan's policy, now overturned, included a phased end to Telkom's monopoly status and guarantees of an independent telecommunications watchdog.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said a senior official involved in telecommunications policy formulation: &quot;There had been an extensive consultative process, but at the last minute the minister makes changes ... The minister should have gone back to the sector and said, 'I'm not happy' -- instead of saying, when he first came in, that the minister has changed, not the policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A telecommunications industry member who was involved in the White Paper formulation said industry stakeholders -- with the exception of Telkom, which now appears to have an indefinite reprieve as monopoly operator -- were &quot;furious&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he warned that because Naidoo's rewrite brought the proposed industry-wide South African Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (Satra) under the control of his own ministry, which also governs Telkom, there would be a &quot;serious conflict of interest&quot;. This could scare off international investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Telecommunications Forum (NTF), the industry stakeholders' body formed in 1993 with representatives from the government, business, labour and civil society, and the main vehicle for Jordan's consultative process, was to meet Naidoo on Thursday to &quot;ask for an explanation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, the NTF had been the brainchild of Andile Ncaba, then a member of the ANC Department of Information Systems and now postmaster general. Ncaba, who backs Naidoo's changes, earlier said about the NTF: &quot;One of our objectives ... was to create an investor-confident environment where policies could be addressed in the open, unlike during the apartheid years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To add to Naidoo's troubles the five-person Eminent Persons' Group -- appointed by Jordan last December to resolve differences between stakeholders in the drafting of the White Paper -- last Friday said in a memo to Naidoo it would not certify the new Bill as consistent with the White Paper, another of its duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But group member Dupree Vilakazi said yesterday the memo had been withdrawn on Tuesday after the final version of the Bill -- which previously it could not obtain -- was handed to it. &quot;By Tuesday we were in full support of what happened in Cabinet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A central motive for Naidoo's rewrite relates to government's stated intention to privatise -- a road Telkom appears to have travelled further than any other state utility, with players like Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and the United States AT&amp;T seriously eyeing the minority stake, worth as much as R10-billion, government wants to sell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo seems to want to squeeze maximum value out of such a deal: The longer Telkom's guaranteed monopoly is perpetuated, the greater is the value of the stake bought by the equity partner. Naidoo this week acknowledged the change could be seen as a &quot;sweetener&quot; to attract buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But an industry source criticised this as &quot;narrow minded&quot;, saying that international experience has shown increased competition can only increase the strength of the former monopoly operator. Mexico's Telmex, which was privatised in 1990 when it was twice the size of Telkom, has since grown to six times Telkom's size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jordan's White Paper proposed that Telkom's monopoly be maintained for five years while it meets Reconstruction and Development Programme objectives to supply lines to under-serviced communities, followed by two years of phased market liberalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Naidoo's Bill omits the time-frame altogether, leaving liberalisation at the sole discretion of his ministry. Vilakazi said: &quot;You need a minister with teeth, not a minister who is toothless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rationale behind the loss of Satra's independence is less clear, but the official involved in policy formulation claimed it represented &quot;some state of drift, of asserting more and more state power&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo's clipping of the comparable Independent Broadcasting Authority's wings after he took office -- he appropriated its policy-making powers for his ministry -- seems to have informed his approach to Satra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government appears to have been stung by criticism over the IBA's slow pace of work, and Naidoo may have felt a repeat of that experience could be avoided by placing the telecommunications regulatory function under his ministry. But this fails to address concerns about a conflict of interest where the same ministry controls Telkom and the body that has to regulate Telkom alongside other industry players.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The citizens of Eldoret, a small town at the top of the Rift Valley, cannot believe their luck. Eldoret, once known only for its mushroom farming and world- class middle-distance athletes, has become Kenya's main beneficiary of government development money and industrial growth schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sleepy town of just over 100 000 residents already prides itself on having one of the best hospitals in Kenya, a university, a military barracks and a branch of the central bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By December, Eldoret will also be home to Kenya's third international airport -- and an armaments factory capable of producing 20-million bullets a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why has Eldoret received so much government aid? Some Kenyans say the answer is simple. The town is situated deep in the heart of Kalenjin country, the tribal homeland of Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debating societies in Moi University, on the outskirts of Eldoret, have shied away from discussing the government's generosity to their hometown. But in the Nairobi parliament the issue has become a hot topic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties which balked at the international airport are fuming about the armaments factory. It is estimated to cost somewhere between O6-million and O170-million, but the government has shrouded it in a veil of secrecy and refuses to discuss the financing arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under normal circumstances, a cross-party defence committee should have examined the project, but it too has been kept in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moi says there is nothing sinister about the bullet factory, and claims it is a government project funded from the military budget. The subject has, however, raised concern in Belgium, home to the armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale Herstal, which is helping to build the Eldoret factory and supplying much of the machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Belgian MPs have questioned whether it is wise for a Belgian company to support the factory in a country with a questionable human rights record. They also point to potential arms markets in neighbouring countries such as Burundi, Somalia and Sudan -- all embroiled in conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgian foreign minister Erik Derycke said: &quot;It is not in accordance with current African policy, which is aimed at preventative diplomacy and conflict prevention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition Ford-Kenya party has sent a protest letter to the Belgian government, and is considering lobbying European Union member states over Belgian involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties in Kenya are also concerned about the role the factory will play in domestic politics. Although there is little threat of Moi's governing party losing elections due before the end of 1997, some politicians suggest that Eldoret, with its bullet factory, military barracks and airport, would provide a defensive enclave for the government in case of trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Given the history of the last elections in 1992, when there were land clashes and tribal flare-ups in the Rift Valley, we're very worried that there is a preparation for something,&quot; said Otieno Kopeyo of the Ford-Kenya party. &quot;Weapons manufactured at this new factory could be used against civilians, and that is the most pressing concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Property owners in Harare's upmarket Borrowdale suburb whose homes overlook an estate used by President Robert Mugabe as a weekend retreat have been told to sell their properties to the government for &quot;security reasons&quot;. But they say they are only being offered half the market value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 12-hectare estate, including an imposing homestead, is owned by the ruling Zanu-PF party's shadowy investment company M&amp;S Syndicate which bought it in 1987 as a weekend retreat and retirement home for the president and his late wife, Sally. The previous owner who made his fortune from commodity broking in Zimbabwe lives in Cape Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five neighbouring property owners said they were first approached last year by the senior government valuator, Sunil Fernando, who said he was acting for the Ministry of Defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Informed they didn't want to sell, Fernando cited security considerations: &quot;You are not listening. The Ministry of Defence wishes to acquire your property,&quot; he told them, suggesting they obtain independent valuations of their properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When we submitted the independent valuation he went ballistic,&quot; said one of the owners, Rick Passaportis. &quot;He claimed the valuation was worthless and out of all proportion to the value of the property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passaportis said a reputable local estate agent had valued his property at Z$6-million (about R3- million). His 10ha property contains a four-bedroom main house, three-bedroom cottage, dam, stables, tennis court and swimming pool. The government has offered Passaportis Z$3-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total value of the properties the government seeks to acquire is Z$20-million. This is twice the figure the government allocated to its rural resettlement programme in the current fiscal year. Mugabe made land redistribution the centrepiece of his re-election campaign in April. But critics have said the programme has seen prime land distributed to Mugabe's cronies rather than to peasants crowded in former rural reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I understand that governments everywhere have the right to acquire land. But in view of the fact that in our case this is not for resettlement, government should pay the market price,&quot; Passaportis said, pointing out that he had invested enormous capital and energy building up his property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His lawyers argue the controversial Land Acquisition Act, authorising the government to acquire land, does not cover cases such as this, where no health, public safety or defence interest is involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, two of the owners have accepted the government's offer to purchase their properties. But the government has yet to come up with the money, leaving the owners in a predicament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The houses are blighted,&quot; says Peter Hartnack, one of those who have agreed to sell. &quot;Nobody will buy them knowing the government has expressed an interest. And we can't make the government pay because a successful suit in the courts could not be enforced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe is known to be obsessive about his security, sealing off the approach roads to his main Harare residence and travelling only in heavily armed motorcades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He owns other properties in Zvimba, north of Harare, and in Nyanga, in the Eastern Highlands. In both locations people have been displaced, mostly peasant farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why the government had not made good its offer to buy those properties offered to it, Fernando told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;I don't know.  You should talk to the relevant authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No response could be obtained, however, from the Ministry of Defence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A summit of Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of state meeting on Friday in Gaborone to launch a regional security partnership has provoked protests over the omission of earlier proposals for a human rights monitoring mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC leaders are meeting in a special session to approve long-mooted plans for an Organ on Politics, Defence and Security to co-ordinate security matters among member-states. Acceptance of the new structure had originally been scheduled for August in Maseru, where non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had planned to lobby for inclusion of machinery designed to protect human rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But concern about the deteriorating political situation in Zambia has led to Friday's meeting -- where NGOs fear adoption of the new organ is likely to be rushed through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International is leading a chorus of protests that SADC leaders, while paying lip service to human rights in the organ's objectives, have at the same time excluded any concrete measures for human rights monitoring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty research officer Casey Kelso has mobilised NGOs throughout the region to lobby heads of state and government officials ahead of Friday's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A unified NGO voice on the organ proposal might be able to make human rights a priority for SADC, even at this late stage,&quot; Kelso said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A joint statement by regional NGOs said instability in the region resulted not from the breakdown of law and order, inter-state conflict or external aggression as stated in the proposed organ's objectives, but from the repression of human rights and freedoms by governments and armed opposition movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also said: &quot;We regret that recommendations for human rights institutions resulting from the 1994 workshop on democracy, peace and security, held in Windhoek, Namibia, appear to have been dropped from the organ proposal...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We equally regret the lack of any consultation with Southern African civil society, including non- governmental organisations, in the discussions about the design, creation and implementation of this organ to be adopted at this week's summit. In developing the proposed organ, SADC appears to have made a serious departure from the meaningful dialogue and genuine partnership with civil society which characterised the 1994 Windhoek resolutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADC's Windhoek resolutions, endorsed by NGOs, proposed a SADC mechanism on democracy, peace and security that would have included a human rights commission with machinery to safeguard existing human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This initiative was a response to Zimbabwe's proposal for an Association of Southern African States (as an SADC &quot;sector&quot; where a single member state takes responsibility for its co-ordination).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's proposal was abandoned after SADC countries expressed concern about such a powerful agency being located in Harare under President Robert Mugabe's exclusive jurisdiction. Attempts to revive Mugabe's proposal at the SADC summit in Johannesburg last September were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current proposal for an organ, rather than a sector, means it would function independently of other SADC structures and have a chairmanship rotating among member countries on an annual basis. Mugabe, who is believed to have called today's meeting, is likely to be a candidate for the first chairmanship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NGOs called on the heads of state meeting to &quot;make sure that human rights considerations are a clear component of any intervention by a collective security capacity&quot; and that sufficient resources -- - both in financing and in human expertise -- be afforded to the human rights component of the organ when established, &quot;so that it can effectively carry out the human rights dimension of the organ's objectives, that is monitoring human rights in an early warning system, promoting and protecting human rights among SADC member states and ensuring a human rights component in any SADC intervention&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Former Robben Islander Dr Neville Alexander has to unravel one of the tightest knots tied by the politicians of the post-apartheid order. At a crucial conference on Saturday, Alexander and the 40 members of his Language Plan Task Group (Langtag) will report on ways to raise all 11 official languages to equal standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results of Langtag's endeavours could pave the way for a national language plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress hailed as a political breakthrough earlier this year the clause in the new constitution which makes all 11 official languages equal. However, it is no secret that -- whatever the philosophy -- in practice some are more &quot;equal&quot; than others. Afrikaans enjoys a greater currency than other languages in the public service and the countryside.  English is fast dominating as the language of the workplace, commerce and decision-making, leaving indigenous languages in the dust. Even Cabinet has its meetings in English; certainly Pedi and Venda never get a word in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is to be done to raise the status of the other languages to meet constitutional requirements? How will the state communicate with the people in all 11 languages, as it has promised? How many South Africans understand President Nelson Mandela's speeches these days?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 700 delegates will wrestle with these and related questions in Midrand tomorrow when Alexander and Langtag report back on their six months' research and discussions since receiving their brief from the Arts and Culture Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The central and controversial question is whether South Africa should have a government-funded national language plan, and if so, what impact on public communication and expression it should have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alexander and his team have isolated the problems that stand in the way of developing indigenous languages to a level where they can be used as languages of commerce and power. He says the biggest challenge here is to get black people to bring their languages out of their homes and churches and into the workplace:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question is whether African languages are capable of service as instruments of modernisation in the technological and scientific fields and in education ... We think that they should be. A lot of people think it is enough to speak their language at home only and that is an idea we must really knock on the head as far as I am concerned,&quot; Alexander said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In preparation for a concerted language awareness campaign to be launched at the conference, Alexander suggests practical solutions to aid the development of indigenous languages, especially in situations where vocabulary is lacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One is to draw up a glossary of technical terms which can be shared by all indigenous languages, to fill in the gaps where English comes to dominate at the workplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another practical step is to group languages sharing features, and produce, for example, government documents in Xhosa, with a short Zulu glossary for those words which are different in the two languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alexander, personally, supports the practice of harmonising indigenous languages into main streams, thereby reducing 11 to six: an Nguni cluster, a Sotho cluster, Venda, Tsonga, English and Afrikaans. But, Alexander knows that this raises problems for some mother-tongue speakers, especially those who feel their language could be marginalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a very strong lobby emerging around so- called marginalised languages&quot; -- specifically Tshivenda, Xitsonga, isiNdebele and siSwati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any attempt to regionalise those languages will find quite a bit of resistance ... My personal view is that one will have to appeal to people to be reasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pleas for reason will probably be made frequently during the next months of debate, because language decisions rouse passion, both political and personal, as well as questions of cultural identity. Further, politicians are quick to use language questions to mobilise political and ethnic support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has the example of Afrikaans, which was built up by National Party governments and civic bodies for political reasons and then foisted on a multilingual nation, leading to enormous bitterness in all communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reflecting on the past, Alexander is fairly confident that Afrikaners will eventually accept that their language is now only one of 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to appeal to the Afrikaans leadership to see Afrikaans as one of the most powerful languages of a number in Africa rather than as a competitor against English, a world language ... Once they accept that, they would have made the epistomological break with the Afrikaans past ... I think the new generation is accepting this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's likely the conference will agree to a national language plan because the need for a uniform policy is great; a coherence in the ways languages are used in government, education and the public broadcaster will go some way towards helping all South Africans to understand what is going on in the often confusing new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should Langtag's final proposals be accepted by the government, it is likely that the Pan African South African Language Board will oversee the implementation of that plan for the next few years. And while the task is daunting -- given ethnic sensitivities towards language, and a shrinking government purse -- Alexander is upbeat in his conference statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The historical and constitutional context in which we are setting out to draft a national language plan is the most favourable for any nation in the second half of the 20th century. South Africa is in the midst of a rapid and deep-going transition ... For a few more precious years, the country will resemble nothing so much as one vast social laboratory ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eight subcommittees will report to the Langtag conference tomorrow, each dealing with a different complexity or problem to be tackled. They will report on: Literacy; Language as an economic resource; Language in the public service; Language in education; Heritage languages and special language systems (such as sign language); The development of South African languages; Equitable and widespread language services; Language equity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deadline for submissions for Langtag's final report is July 7, more than a week after the conference. The report will go to Minister of Arts and Culture Ben Ngubane at the end of July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Transvaal Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira will go ahead with plans to charge some of the 22 policemen who approached the Truth and Reconciliation Commission this week, saying their offer to co- operate with the truth body may &quot;well be&quot; an attempt to pre-empt prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D'Oliveira confirmed there was a &quot;significant overlap&quot; between the 20 crimes the group was contemplating confessing and crimes his office was investigating, or which had surfaced during his office's prosecution of former Vlakplaas hit-squad commander Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> D'Oliveira, who directs a special investigation team into apartheid security force crimes, agreed it was &quot;indeed possible the intended step may be an attempt to pre-empt prosecution&quot;, but said: &quot;As far as I am concerned, the law should run its course.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It emerged this week that the group of 22 former and serving policemen -- so far unidentified, but including a brigadier and &quot;several colonels and majors&quot; -- had written to the commission putting out feelers about asking for amnesty for 20 crimes in the 1980s and early 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter, compiled by lawyer Johan Wagener, who recently resigned as state attorney, reportedly specifies crimes including the bombing of Khotso House in Johannesburg and other bombings, the murder of the &quot;Pebco three&quot;, cross-border raids, and the murders of Jeffrey Sibiya Bophu, Brian Nqulunga, Beki Mlangeni and Jackson Maake. Wagener delivered a copy to D'Oliveira last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former police commissioner Johann van der Merwe this week confirmed he and other ex-generals supported the approach and would accept collective responsibility where applicable. He said the generals would also consider individual amnesty applications &quot;if information from (one of Wagener's) clients implicates them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela this week hailed the group's approach to the truth commission, and it has been widely described as the commission's first major breakthrough in its attempts to lure former security force operatives to confess sins of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a senior Justice Department official said this week it seemed amnesty was only being sought for crimes where security operatives knew they were likely to be caught: &quot;These guys saw their impending arrests and tried to forestall it. It is a cheap shot ... But they are underestimating the attorney general's office.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that changes had been made to truth commission legislation late last year, at D'Oliveira's initiative, to regulate the relationship between the attorney general and the commission. As a result, the commission cannot take on cases already under investigation unless the attorney general agrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official said D'Oliveira &quot;has said he is not going to hand over these files&quot;, and prosecutions on the more important cases would go ahead.  Once perpetrators had been found guilty, they would still be free to approach the commission for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What remains unclear is how the 22 knew many of them were under investigation. The official said they could have &quot;deduced&quot; this from the actions of the investigating team, but said it could also have been a &quot;mole&quot; or &quot;careless talk&quot; by a member of the attorney general's office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The students and academics who rallied behind Professor William Malegapuru Makgoba in his recent skirmish in Wits University's corridors of power have turned against him and don't want him to lead the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As speculation around contenders for the university's top job grows, it has emerged that the Wits Transformation Front (WTF) did not nominate Makgoba. The WTF had supported Makgoba in his clash with 13 academics who wanted to unseat him from his position as deputy vice-chancellor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He lost favour with them after &quot;capitulating&quot; in the struggle against the group of academics, said Students' Representative Council president Tiyani Mohlaba. Makgoba has been criticised by them for saving his own reputation at the expense of their mission to &quot;transform&quot; the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He left his position on the university's 11th floor to take up a research post at the faculty of Health Sciences after lengthy mediation between the warring parties, but managed to keep his disputed academic reputation intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makgoba, who appears to be more excited about research breakthroughs he has made in the field of human sperm behaviour than a possible future as head of Wits, has however been nominated from an unknown quarter for the post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had not applied -- &quot;I don't apply for jobs&quot; -- and that he had read in the press that he had been nominated. He would &quot;need to reflect and take advice and counsel from many trusted people&quot; before he decided whether to go for the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WTF instead nominated University of the North Vice-Chancellor Njabulo Ndebele and respected political scientist Professor Sam Nolutshungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nolutshungu is the only outsider known by the Mail &amp; Guardian to have applied for the job and appears to be a strong contender. A Fort Hare University graduate, Nolutshungu left the country in the 1960s and continued his academic studies in the United Kingdom. He is currently based at Rochester University in the UK and authored a book called Changing South Africa, published in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndebele is the first choice of a range of academics and students, but he has made it clear he won't apply and it is not known whether he has accepted the nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June Sinclair, deputy vice-chancellor and vice- principal, has been nominated by several people both inside and outside the university. She told the M&amp;G she would certainly take the job if offered it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frederik van Zyl Slabbert scotched rumours that he was a candidate: &quot;I'm not that crazy,&quot; he laughed, adding that he had neither applied for nor been approached to take the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new vice-chancellor must be appointed well before the end of the year, given that three deputy vice-chancellorship positions become vacant at the end of the year and the new vice-chancellor must have a say in the new appointments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Durban - KwaZulu-Natal's local government polls were probably the most peaceful political event the historically stormy province has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here and there a dark cloud hovered over the province's 3,5-million voters as political opponents waged a final stand to protect -- or extend -- their turf, and in some cases angry voters' tempers burst over logistical problems. Serious hiccups were, however, limited to a small portion of the province's 3 500 polling stations and -- for a province marked by more than a decade of civil war -- the most significant event was that the &quot;storm&quot; never came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only conflict-related physical violence reported at the time of going to press was described by local police as &quot;a slight scuffle and a slap or two&quot; exchanged during a confrontation between African National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party supporters in Shakaville township outside Stanger.  Police spokesperson Bala Naidoo reported that &quot;only one death&quot; was reported by the time the polls closed. Naidoo said he could not confirm whether the death in Empangeni was related to the election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Network of Independent Monitors director Jenni Irish said while there were some incidents of violence, &quot;on the whole the elections were much more peaceful than was initially expected&quot;. Even the province's most fiercely contested terrain, the Midlands Regional Council, was described by election officials as &quot;quiet -- the way we like it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time the message of a mural which has adorned a cement fence along Pietermaritzburg's Edendale Road since 1994 seemed out of place: &quot;Our country is in pieces,&quot; it proclaimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In rural Donnybrook and Bulwer, both sites of intense conflict between ANC and IFP supporters until two weeks ago, the pieces of a normal society seemed to be falling into place. &quot;I'm voting because I want to be part of the community,&quot; said 35-year- old Monica Memela, who married into Donnybrook's ANC-dominated Junction township eight years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our community needs water, electricity and roads, that's what I am voting for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I just want to elect somebody who will talk for us and help us to develop our area,&quot; said Lucia Zuma (61), a Bulwer teacher who lamented the fact that her school's 134 pupils still took their lessons in a &quot;school made of mud&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While an uncanny political unity among voters at a given polling station underlined the continued demarcation of much of the province into political &quot;no-go&quot; areas, an ANC election poster hanging outside an IFP-dominated polling station in Pietermaritzburg's battle-scarred Imbali township bore witness to recent attempts to bridge the gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More importantly, the common interests of the two arch-rivals' grassroots supporters have begun to peek out from under the hitherto deadly veil of political hostility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imbali's IFP voters queued for hours outside a community hall next to the hostel they dominate to vote for exactly the same things as their opponents: &quot;We're voting for houses and street-cleaning and roads. We want someone to tell our problems to,&quot; said Miriam Zondo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's really just a wish that something better could happen to us,&quot; said Alice Zondi, a 42-year-old single mother of five who has lived in a makeshift shack since the December floods washed away her home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The polls were certainly not without their problems. Zondi complained that while &quot;so many people came to tell us we must vote for them, nobody told us what we are really voting for&quot;. Lack of voter education, confusion over where to vote, voters' roll errors, late starts and slow-moving polls were just some of the logistical hitches listed by voters and confirmed by the province's local government MEC, Peter Miller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While these snags saw angry voters confronting election officials at some polling stations, other voters waited with extreme patience. In Durban's Umlazi township, a man playing a guitar entertained voters at strife-torn Glebelands hostel, where 24 hours earlier security forces had seized a huge arms cache.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violence monitor Mary de Haas warned however that it was too early to predict the dawn of a new era for the strife-torn province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Shakaville confrontation underlined the fragile nature of the truce.  So did a tense stand-off which developed at Table Mountain outside Pietermaritzburg, when IFP-supporting residents tried to prevent ANC refugees -- who had fled the area amid fierce fighting in the late 1980s -- from casting their ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the counting even started, the ANC had announced plans to challenge the results of several polling stations in the Durban metro, in Shakaville, and in certain areas of two regional councils, amid claims of unfair voting processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP secretary general Ziba Jiyane dismissed the impending challenges as &quot;usual ANC bleatings&quot;, and said he was upbeat about the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The widespread peace on election day -- achieved barely a month after ANC and IFP provincial leaders announced their peace effort and before any joint rallies could be arranged -- shows that much of the violence is organised. The leaders can end it just as quickly as they can start it, and this must intensify the pressure for them to negotiate a final ceasefire and erase the climate of fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Donnybrook and Bulwer, ANC voters still glanced furtively around and lowered their heads before daring to whisper their party's name, despite being surrounded by friends: &quot;We are still afraid. Our enemy is still among us,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durban - Massive security force deployment, recent peace initiatives and a desire to get local elections over with have contributed to a significant decline in violence in KwaZulu-Natal in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although more than 50 people have died in the province so far this month, and intimidation and tension are still widespread, peace monitors report a drop in violence in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the three months preceding the 1994 elections, over 500 people were killed, but in the last three months, fewer than 200 people have died in the province, reports the Human Rights Committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet no fewer than 14 election candidates have been killed and monitors cite several flashpoint areas where the potential for conflict is high, particularly if election results are contested or if the extra security force personnel withdraw too soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monitors attribute the decrease in violence primarily to the presence of almost 30 000 security force members, recent high-profile peace initiatives on the part of church groups and politicians, and the fact that elections -- which have been postponed twice -- simply had to go ahead this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The postponement of elections twice has sent a clear message that violence simply has to stop or the bottom line is -- no elections,&quot; said Network of Independent Monitors co-ordinator Jenni Irish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Irish said her organisation had received many reports of intimidation and people were expressing fears about the possibility of violence, but &quot;the security situation is much quieter than expected&quot;. She attributed this in part to the highly visible policing of the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roadblocks, ongoing weapon searches of hostels in the Durban area (which have all been searched this month) and mobile, quick reaction units were helping to contain violence, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace Committee director Dennis Nkosi said the &quot;winds of change&quot; were beginning to waft through the province, with the many peace intitiatives -- and a particularly effective Radio Zulu campaign -- now merging into a concerted drive on most people's part. &quot;People are really getting sick and tired of the violence. For the first time in its history the KwaZulu-Natal Parliament is conducting its affairs in a more reconciliatory fashion. There is less of the usual arguing,&quot; said Nkosi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ongoing development initiatives, such as the electrification measures in the volatile Bambayi area, were helping to bring about peace, he said. &quot;The local government elections are not about peace but about the delivery of services which people have been yearning for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monitors also attributed the decline in violence to the ongoing police and special task force investigations into hit squad activities and massacres, and successful prosecutions in some instances, which were deterring the actions of instigators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some cautioned that a drop in violence does not amount to free and fair elections. &quot;There is no peace -- a low-intensity civil war continues.  Under these circumstances it is unrealistic to expect that these elections, especially in rural areas, will reflect the real will of the voters,&quot; commented violence monitor Mary de Haas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attacks on candidates, heightened tension and the existence of &quot;no-go&quot; areas like Izingolweni and Richmond militated against free elections, said De Haas, adding however that &quot;death and destruction would probably be far greater&quot; without additional army and police forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In spite of the heavy security force presence now, the damage has already been done, as thousands have fled the areas in which they should be voting, and thousands of others have been threatened with retaliation in the future if they do not join political parties and/or pay monies for arms and ammunition, for the upkeep of the local warlord.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) June 28, 1996 by Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi strongly hinted this week that his party would quit the Government of National Unity in the next few weeks, leaving the African National Congress to rule South Africa alone in the run-up to the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi told the Mail &amp; Guardian he would support a withdrawal bid by his party &quot;if the issue came up&quot; at the IFP's annual general conference next month: &quot;If it came up that the party wanted to leave, then it would be so,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi said he did &quot;not expect that the IFP will remain in the GNU for very long&quot;. Describing himself as an &quot;uncomfortable&quot; member of the national Cabinet and his party as &quot;the unhappy partner in the (former GNU) triumvirate&quot;, Buthelezi said the decision was ultimately up to his party, which had sent him there in 1994: &quot;I was actually reluctant myself, so I'm waiting for the party to react to that,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP secretary general Ziba Jiyane said &quot;there is a strong possibility&quot; that the IFP conference on July 27 and 28 would decide to withdraw from the GNU: &quot;The general feeling in the party is that we should have withdrawn from the GNU last year. The decision to stay was based on pragmatic considerations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane added that party opinion had not changed since last year, and while pragmatic arguments could again veto a withdrawal, &quot;as things stand now, it is a strong possibility that we would leave -- but it is only a possibility&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing the ANC's failure to honour the 1994 international mediation agreement as the &quot;major unresolved issue&quot; bedevilling relations between the two remaining GNU partners, Buthelezi also lashed out at President Nelson Mandela who, he said, had treated the IFP with &quot;utter disdain ... utter contempt&quot; over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi described his relationship with Mandela as &quot;tense&quot;, adding that &quot;while on the face of it when we're together you will see a certain affability and us respecting each other by the clan names of Madiba and Shenge, truthfully that is just our culture, which ... does not reflect the feelings between us at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While neither IFP leader linked the party's possible GNU withdrawal to this week's local government elections in KwaZulu-Natal, the prospect clearly raises the election stakes, as a victory in the IFP's home province would shore up the party's position in advance of a move to the opposition benches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi said local government elections in most countries are about &quot;bread-and-butter issues&quot;, but argued that KwaZulu-Natal's local polls were also about unresolved constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While he supported the recent peace initiative launched by ANC and IFP leaders in the war-torn province, Buthelezi said he did not imagine &quot;there will be any time when everything is rosy in the garden and there is no disagreement between parties. All I really long for is that differences should happen in a peaceful environment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some observers argued that the prospect of an IFP GNU withdrawal -- sure to heighten divisions between KwaZulu-Natal's two leading parties -- was surprising in the context of the recent peace bid, but suggested that the IFP may have engaged in the peace effort in a bid to foster a new image in advance of an opposition alliance with the National Party or Democratic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A realignment of opposition parties was already taking shape nationally, following the National Party's recent GNU exit, and the IFP would have to shed its &quot;Zulu laager&quot; image to guarantee itself a larger slice of the new political pie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promoting a &quot;new&quot; image of itself since announcing its government departure last month, the NP has already appealed to other parties to form an opposition alliance against the ANC, and the IFP has used its KwaZulu-Natal election campaign to reach out to white and Indian voters, portraying itself as a &quot;party of minorities and for minorities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Buthelezi said NP leader FW de Klerk had approached him and &quot;said we should get together on the basis of values&quot;, he denied the IFP would be taking its cue from the NP: &quot;Fortunately we're not the lapdog of the NP and I can't see ourselves like a little terrier dog trotting behind them, just because they have taken a decision,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rejecting NP allegations that the IFP was clinging to the GNU &quot;gravy train&quot;, Buthelezi said: &quot;I find it in bad taste when the NP members are now saying that we don't want to leave the gravy train ... because they had a lot of perks when they ran this country alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi was more positive about prospects for an IFP opposition alliance with the DP. While De Klerk had been &quot;speaking generally, not just to the IFP, (DP leader) Tony Leon on the other hand actually came to me and said he had five values which we could share and we found no problem with them. We amended just one of them slightly and I put them to the national council and they accepted it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi said, however, that he believed Leon would face &quot;problems&quot; within his party over such an alliance: &quot;There are many people to whom I've related for decades, like Colin Eglin, who I think would love to see that, apart from Leon. But there are people in the DP who are very, very much anti-me and anti-IFP --particularly in KwaZulu-Natal,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While a successful peace effort in the province could reduce opposition from the DP's KwaZulu-Natal caucus, the fate of the province's constitution -- around which arguments were due to be heard this week in the Constitutional Court -- could still threaten that process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Warning that a rejection of the document by the court would have a &quot;very bad effect&quot; on the province, Buthelezi said: &quot;If it is not certified then we are really back to square one. I think that as long as we're in conflict, we may not be able to succeed to reduce the tension that flares up into acts of violence between us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Times Media Limited -- owner of the Sunday Times, Business Day and other titles -- this week apologised to reporters after being accused of tactics &quot;reminiscent of the former security branch&quot; in compromising confidential sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporters said that earlier this month TML Johannesburg switchboard operators, using computer recordings of numbers dialed by reporters, called those numbers in an attempt to check whether they had been private or business calls. Some reporters were billed for &quot;private&quot; calls.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears the check was an attempt to cut down on private calls made by employees to combat rising telephone bills, but on Wednesday TML managing director Roy Paulson called Jimmy Beaumont, South African Union of Journalists (SAUJ) branch co- ordinator, to say management conceded it had made a mistake, and assured reporters there would be no repeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TML group human resources manager Sian Dennis told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;This is not company policy. We have been made aware of it, and we are investigating it to its fullest extent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporters were left embarrassed when confidential sources -- in one instance at least a parliamentary figure -- were quizzed on the nature of conversations they had had with reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confidentiality of sources is seen as a sacred rule of journalistic ethics. Said Motsomi Mokhine, general secretary of the SAUJ: &quot;Journalists thought this exercise compromised their integrity. To that extent the union is alarmed that management could initiate an excercise like this without first consulting with employees ... I think one of the (outcomes) could certainly be that TML would in the long term be compromised, as people would be less willing to go off the record with journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mokhine said there was always a danger that information on journalists' contacts could fall into wrong hands, and that the SAUJ would discuss the TML incident at a national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beaumont said: &quot;We regret that little forethought seems to have been employed in checking up on people in this manner; the tactic would seem to be more reminiscent of the former Security Branch than a responsible newspaper management. In the process, some journalists have been embarrassed and their confidential sources compromised, which is unforgiveable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAUJ members charge management broke an earlier undertaking to record only the first five digits of outgoing calls to protect the identity of reporters' contacts, and maintain that a voluntary identification of private calls, as is the case in many other companies, would have solved the problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Former defence minister Magnus Malan sat motionless in the Durban Supreme Court dock this week, pondering a front-page newspaper report under the headline &quot;Ex-generals admit 20 crimes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The article referred to Monday's landmark decision by various former security force generals, including former police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe, to admit &quot;collective responsibility&quot; for 20 human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan, who is on trial for his alleged involvement in the 1987 KwaMakhuta massacre in which 13 people died, read the story slowly, smiled and handed the newspaper back to a curious journalist. &quot;No comment,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five minutes later, he was standing among many of his former military colleagues as Judge Jan Hugo entered the courtroom to start another day in the nearly four-month-old trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week's news that some former generals have approached the Truth and Reconciliation Commission fuelled speculation over whether Malan and some of his fellow-accused should follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the trial, Malan scoffed at suggestions of appearing before the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His legal counsel, advocate Sam Maritz, said on Tuesday: &quot;As presently advised, I know of no desire to apply for amnesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The past week of proceedings suggest the seven defence teams representing the accused may be finished with their case sooner than expected. Seven of the 17 accused have already testified in their defence and ailing Liebenberg could finish his testimony shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liebenberg was the co-author of the top-secret Liebenberg Report, which allegedly functioned as the blueprint for military assistance to Inkatha during the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His testimony this week has highlighted possibly the major thrust of the defence case: that military assistance to Inkatha did not include &quot;offensive&quot; training of Inkatha supporters and did not result in &quot;offensive actions&quot; against the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said reference to setting up an &quot;offensive element&quot; in his report should be viewed within the context of present-day military terminology, which made little distinction between &quot;offensive&quot; and &quot;defensive&quot; military functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For us it was clear that we were talking about an offensive element within the context of proper protection,&quot; Liebenberg said, adding that the Caprivi trainees had been instructed to protect dignatories and property of the KwaZulu homeland government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His testimony matched that of former accused Tienie Groenewald, who served as chief director of military intelligence until 1986. Groenewald was one of three men discharged from the trial last month at the end of the state's case, which, Judge Hugo ruled, had failed to incriminate the three men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Called to testify last week, Groenewald told the court so-called offensive elements such as that outlined in the Liebenberg Report &quot;are an acceptable part of VIP protection units worldwide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the trial, IFP deputy secretary general and accused number seven in the trial, Zakhele &quot;MZ&quot; Khumalo, also claimed ignorance of alleged &quot;offensive&quot; intentions of the Caprivi trainees and their military instructors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo, who served as liaison officer between Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the SADF at the time of the KwaMakutha massacre, said the Caprivi trainees were transported back to Natal in 1986 &quot;to win hearts and minds&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence counsel has indicated that it might call upon military experts to explain the use of the term &quot;offensive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prospect clearly intrigued KwaZulu-Natal attorney general and senior state prosecutor, advocate Tim McNally, who appears to have a clear understanding of the meaning of the term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole issue of definition is being resolved by the authors of the term coming to explain the context in which it is used,&quot; he said this week.  &quot;Whether they're being truthful in the use of the word is something the judge will have to decide.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Mexico's southeastern mountains and valleys still occasionally resonate with the sounds of gunfire and poetry, as they did on January 1 1994, the day the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect and the Zapatista peasant army temporarily took control of dozens of towns in the state of Chiapas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But next month the uprising will take on a different flavour as tens of thousands of participants from across the world gather at the &quot;Intercontinental Encounter for Humanity and Against Neoliberalism&quot; in La Realidad -- and South Africans opposed to their government's sudden lurch towards neo-liberal economics may find some practical examples to back their programme, in the jungle town that the Zapatista's have turned into a liberated zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Alternative Information for Development Centre (AIDC) in Cape Town is arranging for a group of South Africans, mostly from organised labour and the civic movement, to attend. There they will focus on the development of bottom-up strategies to confront the free-market features of globalisation which the Zapatistas argue are central to their ongoing oppression -- and are increasingly generalisable to the rest of the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says AIDC director Brian Ashley: &quot;The comparisons with Mexico are spooky: macroeconomic conditions, our government's allegiance to financial overlords, the similar traditions we share in national struggles, the sense of needing to keep civil society as strong as possible. South Africans can go to Chiapas to both learn and teach.&quot; Ashley was referring to the way the Zapatistas have created a bridge between their local struggle and a general attack on neo-liberalism. Organising throughout Mexico is helping to bring urban, worker, women's, gay/lesbian and environmentalist concerns into the movement. Now an &quot;Alternative Economic Strategy for Mexico&quot; has even been mooted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zapatistas' leading economic advisors are Professors Carlos Salas and Alejandro Nadal. In a visit to South Africa last month, Professor Salas told audiences of parallels he noticed between the two countries' underlying structural contradictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These include the economic bias toward luxury goods production and imports for middle-class, extreme wealth polarisation and underdeveloped production to meet basic needs, declining prices for the raw materials exports upon which both countries grew dependent, and the destructive flood of &quot;hot money&quot; into -- and then out of -- the stock and bond markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mexico suffered an economic disaster in 1995, including a fall of 6% in GDP, a 65% crash of the peso and 50% stock market collapse, 8 000 firms in bankruptcy, the loss of 1,3-million jobs, a one- third cut in real wages, huge increases in interest rates and a national &quot;bond boycott&quot;-style popular movement of more than a million debtors from all walks of life called &quot;El Barzon&quot; (the yoke).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's contradictions are nowhere near as serious, but the recent 25% collapse of the rand -- - which ironically has generated calls for further liberalisation, whereas in Mexico even the IMF reckoned that tighter regulation of financial flows was in order -- provides some indication of the turbulence and fragility exacted by global economic forces. As in Mexico, the need to soothe foreign investors and local financiers apparently motivated much of government's &quot;Growth, Employment and Redistribution&quot; strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while labour and social movements across the world offer passionate critiques of neo-liberalism, they have often stumbled in posing feasible but still radical alternatives. The Zapatistas may provide inspiration to their guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From the Zapatistas' jungle HQ where Marcos and tens of thousands of civilians and combatants have retreated, a unique challenge to neo-liberal economics is emerging that is partly pre-modern, sometimes post- modern, partly classical Marxist, and distinctly grounded in &quot;civil society&quot; (in other words, neither a political party or traditional guerrilla movement).  &quot;Zapatismo is not a new political ideology or re-fried old ideologies,&quot; says Marcos in a recent Internet communique. &quot;It serves, only in the way bridges serve, to cross from one side to the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A leading United States lawyer has thrown his weight behind an attack on South Africa's final Constitution for allowing big companies to steamroll the rights of individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ralph Nader warns the Constitution could entrench a new form of power abuse in the country -- &quot;autocratic rule by big corporations&quot;. In an article for the Mail &amp; Guardian, he says it is crucial that the Constitution -- which gives juristic persons, such as companies, the right to make use of the Bill of Rights -- put individuals' rights first.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nader has helped draft an objection to the Constitution by a local team of public policy advocates. The court will start certifying the Constitution next week, checking whether it conforms with the principles laid down in the interim Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectors say: &quot;The risk is (the Constitution) will entrench and extend prevailing inequalities and frustrate the ability of our new democracy to redress past injustices and to advance meaningful freedom and inequality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their objection is accompanied by a document which argues South Africa suffers from one of the most unequal distributions of wealth in the world, with 10% of the population hogging 47% of the country's income. They remind the court South Africa's economy is dominated by a few massively powerful companies -- such as Anglo American -- whose wealth would give them far more legal firepower than individuals if there were a clash of constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They argue the granting of equal rights to companies could undermine the new government's policies of fighting inequality, regulating companies and fostering development. In particular, they say it could undermine the goals of the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectors say there is considerable foreign constitutional case law, particularly from the United States, which shows how the granting of constitutional rights to big companies has undermined the rights of individuals --in particular, the right to freedom of expression, freedom of association, free speech and privacy . &quot;The rights of natural and juristic persons are frequently incapable of equal coexistence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most striking risks posed by the Constitution, Nader warns, is that South African companies could use the Bill of Rights to outgun individuals when it comes to drumming up support for political parties. He says that by allowing companies to bask in the right to &quot;campaign for a party or political cause&quot; South Africans could soon find their new found democratic powers undermined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objectors are Patrick Bond of the National Institute for Economic Policy, Darlene Miller of the Institute for African Alternatives and Zita Langa of the South African Communist Party. They stress they do not believe that juristic persons -- which include bodies such as trade unions and action groups -- should never enjoy constitutional rights, but that the Constitution should merely recognise that their rights conflict with those of individuals and that the rights of individuals should come first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another objection to the Constitution which is likely to be hotly debated is the controversial lockout clause. Business South Africa is leading the charge against the bar on business from locking out workers yet gives workers the right to strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cosatu's counsel, Gilbert Marcus and Dennis Davis, argue the Constitution does give employees and employers parity of arms considering the historical imbalance of power between labour and business in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg) June 28, 1996 by Gaye Davis and Justin Pearce</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - While Cosatu this week claimed the banks' climb-down over interest rates as a victory, the finance institutions knocked the wind from the sails of an attempt by the labour federation to re-marshal the mass democratic movement against the government's new economic policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organisations which met last week to map a campaign culminating in a day of action on July 13 will gather again on Friday to review the situation and plan a further strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will include representatives of the ANC/Cosatu/SACP alliance, the civic movement Sanco, the student organisations Sasco, Cosas, Young Christian Students, the Muslim Youth Movement, Call of Islam and the unions Numsa, Ppwawu and Nehawu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their coalescing around a campaign against the banks, some saw glimmers of hope that it would mark a new beginning for the left, in which it would re- gather its forces sufficiently to challenge both capital and the state -- and assert itself in what is now the central political debate: the trajectory of the country's economy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Patrick Bond, a senior economist with the National Institute for Economic Policy, and Mzwanele Mayekiso, head of Sanco's Development Research Institute, believe the &quot;denouement&quot; of the ANC/SACP national democratic revolution --because of global economics and political compromises concluded during negotiations -- has &quot;left the impoverished majority frustrated and the left divided and confused&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They believe salvation lies not only with the emergence of strong, working-class parties but in building a class-conscious civil society that would oppose market-oriented development in favour of people-centred development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But they say the dilemma for the Mass Democratic Movement is that it is &quot;stuck between understandably fierce loyalties to the ANC ... and a grim recognition that not much has changed, or will, in socio-economic terms&quot;, resulting in a growing tendency to corporatism -- &quot;elite deal-making&quot; between government, labour and capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The left is trying to galvanise itself. But the challenges are great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's labour movement is facing its biggest crisis yet. Labour analysts across the spectrum agree the unions must yet meet the challenge of working with their old ally, the ANC, as government, taking on a harsh new global economic order and battling with declining membership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a South African Labour Bulletin article published earlier this year, Jeremy Baskin, director of the National Labour and Economic Development Institute (Naledi), notes a 6% fall in union membership in the past two years, a decline particularly marked in the manufacturing sector (down 15% on 1991 figures). The only sector showing membership growth is the public service, which Baskin attributes to staff associations becoming unions and unease prompted by government's plans to rationalise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of the Witwatersrand industrial sociologist Professor Eddie Webster, in an article in Southern Africa Report, identifies both the transition to democracy and the equally profound economic transition as defining the new terrain in which unions must now operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a perception that government has moved in a direction not favoured by labour because, in the words of one analyst, &quot;other classes and groups are better organised&quot; (read big business).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no clear sense of where we are going, and that is very undermining,&quot; said one analyst. But organised labour's record since the 1994 elections show it still has the capacity to organise strikes and street protests. Analysts cite too that Cosatu's alliance with the ANC has won it some ground, both in the Labour Relations Act and in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether these gains can be translated into a tangible impact on the government's policy direction remains to be seen, however, particularly with the Reconstruction and Development Programme's &quot;people- driven&quot; potential for fundamentally changing a society in danger of being swamped by a market- driven approach to growth and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RDP Council is supposed to be a watchdog body, aimed at preventing just this. Comprised of formations of the alliance, trade unions and civics as well as sectors embracing women, youth, health, education, religious, environmental and human rights groups, it has so far been unable to make any significant impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A discussion document prepared for a recent national workshop of the council goes some way down the road of self-criticism. It notes that unequal power relations in society mean &quot;business and some sections of the bureaucracy continue to dominate policy formulation&quot;. While the council had built links with government and parliamentary structures and it was important these continued, the council had to be wary of &quot;setting ourselves up as gatekeepers, attempting to monpolise channels of communication&quot; and &quot;becoming little more than a transmission belt for government perspectives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Sanco campaign targeting banks wanting to evict people unable to meet their bond repayments is already underway: Mayekiso says about 49 000 homeowners could be at risk. Mayekiso said Sanco, with 3 000 urban and rural affiliates countrywide, was getting to grips with its lack of resources and the vacuum caused by its leaders entering government. Cosatu was doing the same, and common ideals were emerging between Sanco, Cosatu and the SACP. He expected &quot;a long-term relationship would develop out of the campaign against the banks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sanco's campaign contains some -- possibly fatal -- flaws. Its leadership is weak, its strength on the ground uneven. In its campaign against the banks it is mobilising a group of people who have defaulted on paying their bonds and who may merely be seeking an easy way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The depth and moral coherence of civic struggles in the Eighties is lacking. By encouraging a culture of non-payment, Sanco is threatening the government's housing programme and setting itself at odds with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bond and Mayekiso note that &quot;even with strong traditions of social justice, recent memories of insurgent politics and comrades in government offices, there is too little talk of concrete socialist principles, policies, programmes or projects in the strategic sessions of either movement activists or leftist policy tanks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coming months, as flesh gets put on the bones of government's macro-economic policy, will see the debate heat up and the political contradictions sharpen. The irony is that, for the moment, a more cogent challenge to neo-liberal economics is emerging not in South Africa, but from within Zapatista headquarters in the jungles of Mexico.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The knives are out for Free State premier Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota, even as a delegation appointed by President Nelson Mandela prepares to defuse the crisis which is threatening to tear the provincial government apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Top Free State African National Congress officials this week bluntly told the Mail &amp; Guardian they want the ANC national and provincial leadership to decide whether or not Lekota is to be unseated. On Saturday, the presidential delegation is to meet the provincial government and ANC officials in an attempt to resolve conflicts between Lekota and provincial party structures which date back to 1994, when the premier was ousted as Free State ANC chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past fortnight, the conflicts have reached crisis point over what are seen as unilateral decisions by Lekota to reshuffle the provincial cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those members of the provincial legislature (MPLs) who also serve on the Free State ANC's executive committee blamed the crisis squarely on Lekota, saying he fails to consult with the party on key issues of policy. They pointed to Lekota's recent cabinet reshuffle in which the most senior ANC leaders were overlooked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC Free State secretary general and MPL Kaizer Sebothelo says the party does not want to hold Lekota &quot;captive&quot; and will allow him the choice of abiding by ANC policy or &quot;removing himself&quot; from both the government and the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A trend has developed within Lekota's cabinet, says Sebothelo, whereby party members are fired if they challenge him. &quot;He surrounds himself by people who dance to his tune and he continually disregards the importance of maintaining relations with the ANC in the province.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC provincial chair and MPL Pat Matosa says the root of the split is Lekota's refusal to consult with senior party officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our view as the ANC is that the premier is where he is today on an ANC ticket. In this light, he should be accountable to the ANC as its supporters elected him to that position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a tried and tested tradition of the ANC to collectively consult when making decisions, but the premier seems to forget that he is accountable to the ANC as a political party,&quot; Matosa says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed that Mandela was approached in his capacity as president of the ANC to intervene in a bid to quell the rising tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC representative Ronnie Mamoepa says the delegation to the Free State will be headed by Sports and Recreation Minister Steve Tshwete and will include ANC executive members Joe Nhlanhla (deputy minister of intelligence) and Arnold Stofile (ANC chief whip in Parliament).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mamoepa says the meeting will include the entire Free State ANC executive, including Lekota, and is intended to &quot;find an amicable solution to the matter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reiterated that the dispute is an internal matter, adding &quot;there will be no further comment on the nature of the problem&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the province's executive members are adamant, saying unless Lekota toes the party line, he must quit the ANC and the provincial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lekota says he is confident the matter will be resolved, but could not discuss the dispute as it is being handled by the ANC national executive committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Economic Affairs MEC Ace Magashule says the ANC is empowered by its code of conduct to recall Lekota. However, last week Lekota was quoted as saying the Tripartite Alliance was the only body which could recall him. He also said he was unaware of a meeting where a vote of no confidence was passed by fellow ANC comrades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magashule says the ANC's view is clear: &quot;The premier has to learn to consult and accept collective leadership or else he must quit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says he did not resign from the provincial cabinet but was removed, accusing the premier of &quot;misinforming the public&quot;. Earlier reports were that Magashule had resigned after Lekota shifted him from economic affairs to the transport portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that Magashule did not at any stage hand in a letter of resignation. He was, however, given clear instructions from the region's executive committee not to resign although he was considering it owing to the growing discontent with Lekota's management style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994, Matosa won the ANC's provincial elections against Lekota.  Matosa was voted in by 33 branches, Magashule received 26 votes and Lekota 22 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Magashule, a collective decision was taken prior to the completion of the April elections that Lekota would take up the post of premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was put into that position by the ANC and our manoeuvring, not because of his personal charm and status,&quot; says Sebothelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Free State dispute is a build-up ahead of the provincial congress in November and is worrying senior ANC executives who fear the split could cause further damaging dissention within the party's ranks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A peasant farmer in Karamoja, north-eastern Uganda, scythes sticks of cassava which have survived drought.  A mother of four in heavily populated China pops down a birth-control pill.  A blinded five- year-old girl, in Angola is given morphine before an operation.  A cosmetic counter in a New York department store exudes fragrance. Whether they be life-savers or cosmetics, they all derive from the planet's rich biological diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the profusion of plants, animals and micro-organisms is disappearing at an alarming rate, threatening future food supplies and the making of new drugs.  A United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report warns that since the beginning of the century,about 75 per cent of the world's crop plant varieties have become extinct, and around 500,000 disappear every year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this background, African scientists and experts on African traditional medicine and medicinal plants met in the Ugandan capital, Kampala mid-May,to deliberate on how to arrest the disappearance of African medicinal plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting which brought together more than 50 countries was organised by the Scientific, Technical and Research Commission of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Executive Secretary of the OAU Scientific, Technical and Research Commission (STRC) Professor J.A. Ekpere, the relevance of traditional medical practice in the efficient and cost effective delivery of health services in Africa is no longer in doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current emphasis on biodiversity and conservation of national natural resources, research products and industrial production of drugs from medicinal plants etc, underscores the importance of medicinal plants worldwide,&quot; says the STRC executive secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The symposium served as a forum to review progress in research on and practice of traditional medicine in Africa, human resource development as well as industrial drug production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Ekpere says the conclusions, recommendations and proposals from the symposium are expected to provide an important input into policies, programmes and activities of member states of the OAU to strengthen the contribution of traditional medicine in their health delivery services, enhance regional integration, and encourage international cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also provided an excellent opportunity for research scientists, academicians, traditional medical practitioners, government and industry to share experiences and promote technological cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For industry, scientific research centres and organisations, the Kampala forum presented an avenue to promote their capacity and capability to establish key industrial contacts and joint ventures. technological cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, it was also an opportunity to review the extent to which recommendations of previous meetings have been implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medical doctors and research scientists involved in the search for a cure of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS/HIV, as well as AIDS/HIV patients, will be anxious to learn from each other on Africa's contribution to the battle against this scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the theme, Promotion of African Traditional Medicine and Medicinal Plants, participants received and discussed papers on the development of traditional medicine and medicinal plants; training and human resource development; research; international cooperation; and industrial drug production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A brief issued by a British think-tank on biodiversity, PANOS, says the rich countries of the North are exploiting what is essentially a Southern resource in traditional medicine and medicinal plants. Over 90 per cent of plant species are located in Africa, Asia and Latin America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What amounts to a multibillion dollar market in medicinal plants, PANOS asserts, has been cornered by large multinational corporations, mostly from the North, bent on patenting everything from traditional pest-resistant seeds to human cells.  International patent law remains open to interpretation, but it is usually the local farmers and others in the South who fail to get protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman/coordinator of the Natural Chemotherapeutics Research laboratory in Uganda, Dr. N.K. Mubiru observes that hundreds of medicinal plants collectors were being sent to developing countries by multinational corporations to identify plants with potential preventive and curing properties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These plants were being smuggled every year from the North without any compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marketing the commercial products of biodiversity-scientifically- bred seeds, medicines and cosmetics is a transnational business. New technology that can screen plants for specific genes and genetic engineering can speed up the process of identifying new materials and developing new products, thus potentially making the business extremely profitable, particularly if extended to medicinal plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990 the annual world market value of medicinal plants alone was estimated at US dollars 43 billion.  This business is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, who wield enormous power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The research and development in plant genetic engineering business is said to be dominated by six companies namely; Monsanto, Enimont, Du Pont, Sandoz, Zeneca and Ciba Geigy.  Together with Shell, WR Grace and Cargill - the world's largest international grain and oil seed trader-these companies also dominate the international seed business.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Egyptian journalists have been celebrating an unprecedented victory after a year-long struggle forced the government to back off on June 16 from a libel law which they had said sought to put an end to their profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 16, the Egyptian parliament passed a new law cancelling the harsh prison sentences of up to 15 years for libel which had been imposed in May 1995 by the previous legislation, dubbed by journalists &quot;the press assassination law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have remained solid for over a year in the greatest friction ever between journalists and the government,&quot; Yehya Qallash, a member of the journalists union's executive council, said in an immediate reaction after the new law was passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had no choice, because if we had not, the 1995 law would have put an end to journalism,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the new law still maintains harsh fines for &quot;press crimes&quot; imposed in 1995, including a penalty up to US dollars 5,800 for libel, compared to a maximum $ 300 fine before 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although journalists admitted the new law did not fulfill all their demands, it however crowned the union's year-long fight sparked when parliament passed the 1995 law in a bid to muzzle press criticism of government corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is important is that we have won a reversal of a law that was put on the books,&quot; Qallash added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Union president Ibrahim Nafie sounded a moderate note on June 16 when he said that &quot;there is no rivalry between us and anyone.  There are no winners and losers here. There must be a complete change in atmosphere based on rights and responsibilities requested by journalists,&quot; he said after meeting Prime Minister Kamal Ganzuri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The breakthrough came in a last minute move by President Hosni Mubarak who on June 13 submitted the new legislation after the union asked him to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The People's Assembly had just begun considering a draft compromise bill to replace the 1995 legislation, which also came under fire from journalists who said it ignored their demands and also suppressed press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 13-member union council condemned the draft, threatening a mass resignation for the first time in the union's history and planned a sit-in at parliament on June 15.  &quot;Up until the last minute, the People's Assembly did not intend to respond to a single letter of the journalists' demands,&quot; Qallash explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mubarak, who backed the 1995 law when it first emerged, won praise for the turnaround from both government and opposition press for &quot;supporting freedom of the press and deepening democracy,&quot; but</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> he also cautioned journalists on June 15 that they must &quot;respect society's values&quot; and &quot;not attack the private lives of individuals or the prestige of state institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In comments during a meeting with the executive council of the journalists' union and other intellectuals, Mubarak asked &quot;only that journalists respect society's values and that their future criticisms against corruption do not attack the private lives of individuals or the prestige of state institutions,&quot; according to Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sherif said Mubarak, &quot;with his refusal to affront freedom of the press&quot;, had &quot;ordered his government to put forward a new draft law&quot; which reduces penalties for &quot;press crimes&quot;, including libel, back to their level before a 1995 law which greatly stiffened them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Respect of journalistic traditions is the truest guarantee protecting society against any irregularities by journalists,&quot; Sherif quoted Mubarak as having said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nafie, also head of Egypt's largest government newspaper Al-Ahram, said on June 15 that the &quot;government had accepted in the new draft law six articles&quot; demanded by journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The adoption of the other articles were to be examined during a meeting on June 16 between the union council and Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzuri,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mubarak's warning came at the same time as the police swooped on the house of and arrested and detained for several hours the only journalist to have received a final sentence under the 1995 law, Magdi Hussein, editor-in-chief of the Muslim fundamentalist bi- weekly Al-Shaab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussein told journalists after he was released that his detention was a bid to force him to pay the $ 4,000 fine handed him in May for libel, although he had appealed on June 9 to the courts to allow a delay in payment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussein, who was sentenced in January to a suspended sentence of a year with hard labour and a $ 4,000 fine for libelling the son of the Interior Minister, Hassan al-Alfi, was rearrested and detained briefly for the second time in three days on June 18 over his refusal to pay the imposed libel fine.  This time he was only released after making a formal request to prosecutors to pay the fine over nine months, police sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his earlier detention on June 15, Hussein said, he had been released only on condition that he reported to prosecutors the next day he paid the fine, failure of which could land him a three-month prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a blatant abuse of power by the Interior Ministry,&quot; said Hussein, whose paper has continued heavy criticism of Alfi and alleged financial misdealing by his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Is the Interior Minister attempting to ruin the reconciliation between Mubarak and the journalists?&quot; Hussein asked, saying: &quot;It was totally unnecessary to invade my home and arrest me instead of simply ordering me to appear before the prosecutor.  Am I a fugitive drug dealer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protests began immediately after parliament passed the law in a midnight session on May 27, 1995, when the union threatened to hold a nationwide strike, the first by Egyptian journalists since 1951.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 10, the 12-member executive board of the journalists' union submitted its resignation, protesting that the government had ignored appeals to change a controversial law which they said muzzles freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They accused the government of insisting on passing legislation contradictory to recognized principles of press freedom, complaining that the draft bill did not meet even the minimum standards demanded by the union to change the current legislation, which they said would limit criticism of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 11, the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) also accused the government of increasing tension between journalists and the state through its &quot;inflexibility&quot; in changing a controversial press law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government appears determined not to change&quot; its stance on the law, which it &quot;expects to pass without amendment and without consideration of the journalists' demands,&quot; the EOHR said, and called on Mubarak to intervene and amend the new legislation &quot;to conform with the legitimate demands of journalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bending to the pressure, Mubarak had promised to draw up a new law and at the same time vowed that the &quot;press assassination law&quot; would &quot;go to sleep&quot; and that no one would be prosecuted under it.  But despite his pledge, over 40 journalists were investigated under the new law and five, including Hussein, were convicted and given sentences although none served time, according to human rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Human Rights Legal Aid Centre pointed out that the new bill cut the maximum sentence for defamation, but increases penalties for 22 other offences which are often vaguely defined. It notably called for five years imprisonment for &quot;inciting a coup d'etat, hatred of the regime or spreading doctrines aimed at modifying the principles of the constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A journalist can be jailed for up to three years for &quot;publishing pictures harmful to the country's reputation&quot; and for one year for &quot;insulting an official in the course of his duties, or insulting parliament or official bodies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Egyptian journalists' stand was seen as the first ever concrete achievement by a press group against official harassments, currently widespread among governments in the African continent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The number of illicit drug cases involving Zambians and their accomplices locally and abroad have reached an alarming level, and those involved in the &quot;get rich quick&quot; trade range from high ranking government leaders to ordinary school children, says the country's Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The true picture of more Zambians taking to the drug trade is backed by DEC statistics which indicate that in February and March 1996 alone, the commission arrested more than 200 traffickers and seized drugs worth Kwacha 2 billion (US dollars 2 million) from the illicit trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Drug Enforcement Commission spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani concedes that the influx of hard drugs like ephedrine was prevalent in the country and mentions others like mandrax, opium and cannabis as being readily available on the local market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the upswing in the trade which involves locally grown cannabis and the proliferation of foreign drugs on the Zambian market, DEC says it has devised a national combat strategy to eradicate drugs in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission's efforts to fight the drug scourge was further strengthened by Zambia's hosting of the Interpol African Regional Conference in Lusaka in June 1995.  Opening the conference, President Fredrick Chiluba commended the timing as it coincided with a period when the region was searching for solutions to the high crime rate sponsored by drug barons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference brought together more than 30 countries including observers from seven countries from Europe, the United States and Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During its deliberations, the Interpol meeting observed that the drug dealers were taking advantage of Zambia's liberalised economy to pose as investors who associate themselves with politicians to influence decisions in their favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The drug scourge has not spared families of top leaders in the government who have come to discover that they could enrich themselves overnight by dealing in what is referred to here as the &quot;emerald of Zambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maliko Mwaanga, 19, son of former Foreign Affairs Minister Vernon Mwaanga who himself stepped down to pave way for investigations in alleged drug dealings, together with two retired soldiers were arrested by army officers at Lusaka showgrounds in the capital as they were about to conclude a transaction involving cocaine with a street value of Kwacha 69 million ($69,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DEC spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani said Maliko -- then a grade 12 pupil at Choma Secondary School, and his accomplices, retired soldiers Emmanuel Chola 33 and Kayumba 36, were trafficking 153 grammes of very high grade cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On goes the list ...a Lusaka resident caught red-handed with 212 tablets of mandrax was jailed for two years with hard labour while the accomplice, a minor, was ordered to be caned six times by a Lusaka magistrate court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Principal Resident Magistrate Meebelo Kalima told Moses Mutalama, 20, and a grade 10 schoolboy that drug dealing was prevalent and so it was up to the courts to mete out deterrent sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Interpol President Bjorn Erickson who is the Swedish Commissioner of Police, chairing the African Regional Conference said, drug barons were exploiting the liberalization of the economy by entrenching themselves in businesses and influencing decisions. He charged that Africa's drug business had reached a staggering $400 billion, and a further $100 billion was used to establish banks which were used in money laundering operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Erickson regretted that most governments were cutting budgetary allocations to police at a time when more resources were needed to support measures aimed at fighting drug trafficking and crime, which endanger the moral fabric of society and national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At last year's forum, DEC spokesman Mr Sinyani alluded that opium reaching Zambia was from the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; in Asia while cocaine came mainly from Brazil.  He explained that following the identification of drug sources, DEC had opened an active network with Brazil and expressed hope the measures would achieve results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The climax to the extent to which Zambians have gone to trade in drugs is illustrated by a February 1996 incident in which DEC seized the biggest haul of cocaine, when it apprehended a woman at the Lusaka International Airport with more than four kilogrammes of the drug worth nearly kwacha 2 billion ($2 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The suspect, Evelyn Mombasa Mwanakaoma, 40, a housewife, was arrested upon disembarking from a plane coming from Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seizure was made when Mrs Mwanakaoma was found with drugs concealed in her brand new suitcase which had two false compartments where the consignment was expertly concealed.  Her air ticket indicated she left Rio-de Janeiro in Brazil for Lusaka via Luanda. Her circuitous route when travelling from Brazil earlier in January 1996 was Lusaka, Johannesburg, Luanda and Rio-de Janeiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are more startling incidents.  One that was extensively covered by a local daily here was that of a former Zambia Airways employee Florence Kapata, 26, and her Ivorian boyfriend Mammadou Konate, 32, who in June appeared in a Lusaka Magistrate Court charged with murdering Mrs Barbara Sakwanda, a primary school teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The couple was alleged to have made Mrs Sakwanda swallow 29 pellets of drugs with a street value of K 102 million, ($102,000) which became stuck in her throat and eventually led to her death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting to preserve Zambia's credibility which is at stake, the DEC has reiterated that it would make frantic efforts to ensure the country was not turned into a safe haven for traffickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as the DEC researches on new strategies to combat drug peddling, dealers are also busy devising sophisticated methods of evading the dragnet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The intensification of the war on drug dealers is to some extent paying dividends, according to the DEC.  There is one incident of four tonnes of Zambian grown cannabis worth more than K 1 billion ($1 million) that was seized in Canada.  &quot;If Canada which is away from Zambia can have four tonnes of cannabis from Zambia, what do you expect Zambia to have?&quot; poses Sinyani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Realising the immense monetary gains derived from cannabis, a good number of Zambian peasant farmers have abandoned growing legalized cash crops such as the staple food maize, in preference to cultivating large tracts of cannabis fields from which they reap abnormal profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the DEC, the series of arrests countrywide is enough proof of more Zambians getting enticed to the money spinning cannabis farming.  Sinyani singled out Southern Province where cannabis that is grown extensively today, was originally used for traditional purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of farmers arrested by DEC for growing cannabis has risen tremendously.  Recently, two Chibombo peasant farmers in Central Province fell victim to DEC operations for cultivating 866 kilogrammes of cannabis worth street value of K 216.5 million ($216,500).  The deal was foiled when the growers severely beat up and killed one of the pigs they found grazing in the cannabis plantation.  In a similar operation in the North Western Province town of Solwezi, the DEC arrested five people found with cannabis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DEC statistics show that in 1994 alone, 870 tonnes of cannabis were seized throughout Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the light of the intensity of drug activities in the region, African heads of drug services who converged in Lusaka to map out new strategies of combating drug trafficking, recommended that bank laws in their countries be revised to facilitate investigations of money laundering to curb the rising menace in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the recommendations passed by the Interpol delegates included one which stipulated that the cultivation of cannabis should be banned because it was the most abused drug in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's DEC spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani said delegates had resolved that countries should adopt mechanisms and enact legislations which would enable officers to monitor and investigate money laundering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegates also agreed that countries in the region should sign extradition treaties so that suspected criminals would be tried in countries in which they committed crimes regardless of their nationality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those countries in the region which had not yet ratified the 1961, 1971 and 1988 United Nations Conventions on Drug Trafficking and Psychotropic Substances should ratify them as soon as possible to facilitate implementation of the resolutions,&quot; the Lusaka forum emphasized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From the gloomy picture painted of the involvement of its citizens in the flourishing lucrative drug trade within and across its borders, the government of Zambia, must unleash and put in place workable measures to fight the vice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worse still, the authorities may find it difficult to fight the scourge from within, following the implication of cabinet ministers and other high ranking leaders in the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, President Fredrick Chiluba's government came under fire Deputy Speaker Mr Sikota Wina and his wife Princess Nakatindi Wina, and former Foreign Affairs Minister Vernon Mwaanga to pave way for investigations.  They have since been acquitted of charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ordinary peasant farmers, school children and the novice to the drug business know very well the risks involved but find it an easy way to eke a living in a country riddled with high poverty rates, malnutrition and low levels of employment opportunities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Four Zambian journalists have refused to name their sources leading to a story alleging that Legal Affairs Minister, Remmy Mushota, attempted to cash on April 4 this year a Zambian Kwacha ZK 210 ($210,000) government cheque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The independent Post managing editor, Bright Mwape and the paper's senior journalist, Chilombo Mwondela, including Chronicle newspaper journalists, Nkonkomalimba Kafunda and Anthony Mukwita, were summoned on June 19 to appear before a legal tribunal appointed to verify the journalists' allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four could face imprisonment if their story is found to be false and continue not to reveal their sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to information availed here by the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA), the four journalists were summoned to appear before the tribunal on June 19 under a parliamentary and ministerial Code of Conduct Act which contains a clause requiring journalists to disclose their sources.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Act was passed early last year amid protests from journalists saying that it was professionally unacceptable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, investigations into the case are still continuing and if the tribunal's initial findings prove that press allegations against Mushota were false, a second tribunal will be established to compel the four journalists to reveal their sources or risk imprisonment, says MISA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mwape, the government called for the tribunal when a member of the public, retired Brigadier General Nicholas Zulu, wrote to ask for an inquiry into the matter after reading the allegations in the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu is a United Independence Party (UNIP) member, now under custody awaiting treason trial, for alleged involvement in a spate of bomb blasts in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwape said the Zambian Constitution has a provision stating that a member(s) of the public can ask the government to investigate media allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal is chaired by a High Court Judge and two other judges while witnesses have been subpoenaed from the Ministry of Legal Affairs accounts department, the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Zambia.  The Anti-Corruption Commission is also expected to give its evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The subpoenaed civil servants stand to be punished if they refuse to testify before the tribunal and if they are found to have leaked information to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The June 20 edition of The Post quoted Mwape objecting before the tribunal that he and his colleagues should disclose sources saying: &quot;I want to tell the tribunal that my profession thrives on mutual trust and confidence between journalists and their sources and I won't sacrifice that trust and breach it for Dr. Mushota's sake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwape reportedly told the tribunal that he believed justice would still be done since &quot;evidence given to the tribunal so far had confirmed the accuracy of The Post story and my sources would not add any value to Mushota's case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mushota reportedly had himself persistently demanded that in &quot;the interest of justice, Mwape should disclose his sources&quot; because &quot;the duty of this tribunal is to establish facts and truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post quotes Mushota as arguing that justice will not be done if Mwape does not reveal his sources.  Mwape is, however, reported to have added that he was aware of the government's high-handed action against public employees leaking information to the media even if such information was accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Lucy Sichone, a civic activist and freelance columnist for The Post, told MISA on June 24 that Mushota has initiated criminal defamation charges against her, a human rights lawyer Rodger Chongwe, The Post editor-in-chief Fred M'Membe, The Post's special projects editor, Masautso Phiri, Mwape, Mwondela, Nkonkomalimba Kafunda and Anthony Mukwita for writing and commenting on the allegations that he attempted to cash the ZK 210 million government cheque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sichone, however, said that the Mushota case is test ground for the &quot;government's commitment to transparency and accountability and we are waiting to see how they will deal with their minister if found guilty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At its 1994 Annual General Congress in Swaziland, MISA called for the scrapping of the clause in the Parliamentary and Ministerial Code of Conduct Act requiring journalists writing about political leaders &quot;to appear before a tribunal to justify stories and to disclose their sources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clause was at the time in its draft form and was passed early last year.  According to MISA, the clause &quot;undermines press freedom and, gives exclusive privilege to a few individuals in society, and breaches ethical demands of the profession of journalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Nigeria has released several political detainees as representatives of its military junta entered a final day of talks in London on June 25 over threatened Commonwealth sanctions for the country's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release of Nosa Igiebor, editor-in-chief of the weekly Tell magazine, after six months of detention, brought to four the number of detainees known to have been freed on June 23 and 24, although the latest cases had not yet been officially confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Press reports said on June 25 that at least three other detainees, including two student activists, had also been set free.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The release coincide with a meeting June 24 and 25 between Nigerian military leaders and Commonwealth ministers in a bid to avert punitive sanctions for Nigeria's human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime of General Sani Abacha provoked international outrage last November after it hanged writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists from the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) of southern Nigeria.  Shortly after, Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth over the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), charged with reporting on human rights abuse in Nigeria, has allowed Lagos to send a 17-member delegation headed by Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi to the London talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At an earlier meeting in London in April, the CMAG recommended sanctions against the West African nation but agreed to allow it to argue its case before implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nosa, who was arrested here on December 23 and released on June 24 from Minna prison in the north, according to journalists who saw him on June 25, was one of four detainees interviewed in April by a United Nations team that visited the country to investigate its human rights situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press reported on June 25 that Fred Eno, personal secretary to detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola, was also released on June 24 after spending nearly two years in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no official confirmation of his release, but Abiola's Concord newspaper group told journalists that he was released from Enugu prison on the morning of June 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, whose wife Kudiratu Abiola was shot dead by assailants on June 4, is still in jail facing a charge of treason for declaring himself president as the presumed winner of elections in June 1993, which the military annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military authorities on June 23 also released human rights activists Tunji Abayomi, the attorney of detained former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo and chairman of the Nigerian branch of Human Rights Africa, and Abdul Groh, head of the Organisation for the Defence of Civil Liberties.  Both had been held since July last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Nigeria on June 25 won a three-month reprieve from Commonwealth sanctions that had been threatened following last November's execution of the nine human rights activists but its suspension from the Commonwealth club remained in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high-level panel of Commonwealth ministers announced after a two-day meeting in London with Nigerian officials that an impasse had been broken, and a range of trade and economic sanctions would be held in abeyance until another meeting in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A grim-faced Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, who led a 17- member delegation that met with the CMAG, declined to give specifics of the meeting, and only said that the &quot;impasse&quot; that had existed since Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth following the hangings &quot;had now been broken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kigali - An attempt to bring to trial suspects for Rwanda's 1994 ethnic genocide has been postponed for several more weeks due to a dispute between the Rwandan National Assembly and the government, deputy speaker of the Rwandan parliament Laurent Nkongori announced on June 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda's first trial of the genocide suspects was due to open in the month of June, but has stalled several times in a dispute between the National Assembly and the Rwandan government over the law to be used in cases of genocide and crimes against humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key sticking points are the period the law should cover, sentencing and compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A parliamentary debate on the issue was suspended on June 19 after three days of discussion and was scheduled to be brought back for debate after two weeks, &quot;a move that would delay the opening of the trial, but not for long,&quot; Nkongori said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law will first have to go to the constitutional court after adoption by parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Assembly is dominated by Tutsi members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), who are in power after defeating in July 1994 the majority Hutu-dominated army of the late Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana who was killed in a suspected planecrash in April 6, 1994 along with Burundi Hutu President Cyprien Ntaryamira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their death triggered an ethnic bloodbath which left between half a million and one million people dead, most of them minority Tutsi's and moderate Hutus, whose deaths were blamed on the defeated Hutu army and extremist Hutu militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slaughter only ended when the RPF seized power, and currently more than 73,000 Hutus are awaiting trial in Rwanda's overcrowded jails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tutsi-led government wants to set up its own warcrimes court in parallel to what it regards as an inefficient United Nations Tribunal -- set up in November 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN tribunal, sitting in Arusha, Tanzania, opened preliminary hearings on its first three suspects last month, but the trial is not due to begin until late September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkongori, who heads the commission set up to examine the new law, believes the jurisdiction of the new court should not be restricted to the suggested October 1990 to December 1994 period, but also take account of murders after that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The objective is to eradicate impunity.  If there has been a genocide, it is because for a long time in Rwanda, there was this idea of impunity.  There must be a wish to resolve the problem.  It must not be allowed to pressurize the work ofthe trial,&quot; Nkongori explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deadlock in parliament persists despite the growing number of murders of witnesses to the genocide, which has prompted the UN human rights office in Kigali to voice its concern over the killings that have taken place mainly in the west of the country bordering Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between January and May, at least 48 people have been killed and three reported missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most recent attack came overnight on June 18 when 18 escapees from the 1994 massacres -- and therefore potential witnesses -- were killed in the western district of Kibuye by Hutu extremists crossing from Zaire.  A Rwandan army soldier was also killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The killings come amid growing insecurity throughout the west of the country and frequent cross-border raids by Hutus based in Zaire, according to the Rwandan authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extremists are among some 1.7 million Hutu refugees in Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi who fled massacres and refused to return to Rwanda fearing reprisals by the new Tutsi-dominated government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 24, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, sitting in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, issued arrest warrants for six more Rwandans accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, and violating the Geneva Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six were not identified, at the prosecutor's request, following reports that key witnesses living in Rwanda were being eliminated by armed groups, bringing the number of suspects charged so far in relation to the ethnic massacres in Rwanda in 1994 to nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the UN tribunal judges, Lennart Aspagren, also granted a prosecution request that four key witnesses detained in Cameroon since March be held for a further 30 days, pending their extradition to face charges by the UN court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four, considered to have masterminded the 1994 ethnic slaughter, are Theoneste Bagosora, Ferdinand Nahimana, Andre Ntagorura and Anatole Nsengiyumva.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arusha, Tanzania - A regional summit of Burundi's neighbours has agreed to provide the war-torn tiny central African nation with military assistance to prevent simmering ethnic violence from exploding into another bloodbath like in neighbouring Rwanda, which has a similar ethnic mix.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision was reached on June 25 at a summit in this northern Tanzanian town attended by leaders from six countries in the region -- Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania and Uganda -- as well as the Organization of African Unity (OAU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first time ever during the summit that the Burundian government sought outside help to restore peace in the country, where clashes between Hutu guerrillas and the Tutsi-dominated army have left hundreds dead in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A &quot;technical committee&quot; to be chaired by Tanzania was set up to determine the type and level of assistance needed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Host Benjamin Mkapa, the Tanzanian President, said the four-hour summit had been &quot;very productive,&quot; adding that he hoped the committee could submit a preliminary report before the next OAU summit, set to begin July 8 in Yaounde, Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundian Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo took pains to make it clear that Burundi was not seeking a military operation, but &quot;only help to ensure everyone's safety is assured.  We have not changed our mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the type of aid is yet to be determined, &quot;we are not ruling out any means,&quot; he added, although the government has always said it is hostile to foreign intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi erupted into ethnic violence in October 1993 when Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first elected president from the Hutu majority, was assassinated in an attempted military coup, which has left thousands of people dead since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi's death toll in 1995 alone was put at about 30 a day, but the recent fighting has raised fears of all-out civil war similar to that in Rwanda, which has the same ethnic mix of some 90 per cent Hutus and some 14 per cent Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, between 500,000 and one million people were in 1994 massacred, most of them minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus, allegedly by the defeated Hutu army and extremist Hutu militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their summit communique, the Heads of State and/or Governments present in Arusha affirmed that the negotiations should involve all groups and parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communique made a &quot;renewed and urgent&quot; appeal to all sides in the conflict to put an immediate halt to the violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu and a member of the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), said: &quot;There is a strong wish for the violence to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the main opposition Unity for National Progress (UPRONA) and the Tutsi-dominated army were categorically opposed to the participation of rebel leader Leonard Nyangoma in future peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UPRONA and the army accuse the Hutu rebels of committing genocide, an accusation the rebels make against the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The June 25 closed-door summit was the first time the Hutu president and the Tutsi prime minister, a member of UPRONA, had agreed to attend such a meeting together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also present were Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The absence of Zairean leader Mobutu Sese Seko, who sent Foreign Minister Jean-Marie Nititwa Tumansi instead, was the summit's main disappointment, as Zaire is currently home to more than one million Hutu refugees from neighbouring Burundi and Rwanda, and their governments complain that Zaire is serving as an operational base for extremist Hutus who carry out raids in Burundi and western Rwanda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - With their continent housing some 8 million refugees and 15 million internally displaced persons -- one of the highest number of refugees in the world, churches in Africa are gradually extending their pastoral care to refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Methodist Church in Kenya jointly with the New York, USA-based General Board of Global Ministries (GBGM) and the United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCR), have instituted a joint refugee programme to cater for Rwandese and Burundian refugees based in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The programme, which mainly provides pastoral, relief and medical services to the needy Rwandese and Burundian refugees in the refugee camps in Uvira, Bukavu and Goma (Zaire), was initiated late 1994 following a visit to Rwanda by Methodist church ministers from the United States and Kenya, at the height of the influx of Rwandese refugees into Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Bishop Charles Makonde, who is coordinating the church's (Kenya) programme for preparedness, disaster and relief activities, the team recruits doctors, nurses, pastors and social workers to serve the refugees in Zaire for a three-week period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The recruitment takes place both here in Kenya and the USA and goes beyond doctrinal lines,&quot; Bishop Makonde told APS in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Makonde says about 24 Kenyans and 200 Americans have so far participated in the programme since it was begun nearly two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Methodist clergy said the programme will in future move some of its operations to Rwanda and Burundi &quot;to serve the returnees.&quot; But this, he stressed, would depend on among other factors, the availability of funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Makonde said much of the financial support was coming from the GBGM and UMCR although the Methodist church in Kenya was also making its own contributions.  He did not however disclose the amount of money put aside for the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent interview with APS an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), here said there is a voluntary repatriation of an estimated 500 Rwandese and Burundian refugees from Zaire every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other statistics released by the UNHCR to mark this year's Organisation of African Unity (OAU) African Refugee Day on June 20, indicates that Zaire is rated as one of the countries with the highest concentration of refugees in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The available figures say Zaire currently hosts an estimated 1.5 million Rwandese refugees; 180,000 Burundian; 200,000 Angolans; 111,000 Sudanese and 18,000 Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about some of the major challenges, they were facing in the implementation of the programme, Bishop Makonde said...&quot;There are times we were not able to dispatch the recruited people to the camps, because Zairean authorities barred foreigners from entering the refugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Makonde is also the chairman of the Eastern Africa regional committee of the Refugee and Emergency Services of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek - South Africa's cabinet has passed a decision to continue supporting Channel Africa, the external radio service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) but on a &quot;more rationalized form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 19, the Cabinet decided to grant Channel Africa a stay of execution pending an investigation into the future of the radio station by a cabinet-appointed committee, says a statement from the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cabinet's decision followed a world-wide campaign against the closure of the station, which is estimated to have around 15 million listeners throughout sub-Saharan Africa.  The task force has been given until October to report back to the Cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, in a press release issued on June 19, Minister of Posts Telecommunications and Broadcasting, Jay Naidoo, said: &quot;The precise format and financing of the external service of the SABC shall be finalised by the committee (task force) chaired by the Deputy President, Thabo Mbeki&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ministry of Foreign Affairs responsible for financing Channel Africa had not set aside funds for the station for the 1996/97 year and had indicated in March this year that it would scrap the station's funding and close down the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Staff at Channel Africa formed a committee to try to block the station's closure by lobbying Cabinet and mobilising support from listeners throughout Africa.  As a result, hundreds of letters from different organisations and individuals throughout the world poured in urging the Cabinet to withdraw its decision to close Channel Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a June 9 press release, the sub-committee to be chaired by Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki, comprises the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Posts and Telecommunications and Broadcasting, Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, and Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A report will be submitted to Cabinet by October (1996) taking into consideration reports from the task group on government communications and further feasibility studies done by the SABC,&quot; said t</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to MISA on June 24, Acting Executive Editor for the radio, Flame Nieuwenhuizen, said he would not precisely say what &quot;rationalized form&quot; implied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One thing might happen; Cabinet could decide to cut down the budget by October while discussions on the future of Channel Africa continue.&quot; He, however, said that he would not be able to say what would happen in the event that the budget is reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a Channel Africa employee who asked for anonymity told MISA that &quot;the matter remains sensitive.&quot; He said there was still fear among journalists and other employees that &quot;come October, Cabinet could decide to close down Channel Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said the employee: &quot;This celebration that the government will continue to support Channel Africa is rather too early.  Campaigning for continuation of Channel Africa from outside should continue or we could be surprised by the end decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Channel Africa broadcasts in seven languages to much of the African continent and Nieuwenhuizen claims that about 15 million people listen to this channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is housed in the SABC's Johannesburg headquarters, and employs just over 100 staff plus 30 to 40 correspondents throughout Africa. For many years, the station was a propaganda tool of the apartheid regime, but Channel Africa has since changed along with the country's political development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The service was first established in 1966 as Radio Republic of South Africa but repositioned itself as Channel Africa in 1992.  It embarked on a transformation process resulting in a new mission statement which pledged to make the station &quot;a comprehensive and authentically African communications forum which serves Africa from Africa, totally objective and credible and reliable, dedicated to the promotion of positive development in Africa, committed to the enhancement of dialogue, understanding and co-operation between all African people as their 'Channel of Goodwill'...'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - South Africa said goodbye and thank you to the Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town and Metropolitan of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa, in a glittering service attended by clerics, kings and African leaders on June 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heading the list of dignitaries attending the thanksgiving service at Saint George's Cathedral here were President Nelson Mandela, deputy president Thabo Mbeki and Fredrick de Klerk, Lesotho King Letsie III, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelethini, President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Sir Ketumile Masire, president of Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, in an address to the densely packed cathedral congregation, said that Tutu &quot;has been a blessing and inspiration to countless people, here and abroad,&quot; and praised him as &quot;a fearless fighter against the evil and inhuman system of apartheid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu, who will be 65 in October, hands over to a new archbishop of Cape Town, Njongonkulu Winston Ndugane, on June 30, but will continue as chairman of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is charged with uncovering the gross human rights violations of the apartheid era, and under certain conditions forgiving their perpetrators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This task is likely to last another 18 months after which the archbishop-emeritus will take up a university fellowship in Atlanta, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leading a battalion of bishops from the Anglican communion and from other churches around the world, the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, insisted: &quot;No one would possibly say we have heard the last of Desmond Tutu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the course of a sermon from the cathedral pulpit, Carey described Tutu, who was awarded the Nobel Peace prize in 1984, as a &quot;fearless</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and outspoken critic of all that is unjust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Mandela was in jail, he said, &quot;Desmond's voice was one of the few heard in my country and abroad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carey also spoke about the retiring archbishop's noted sense of humour.  &quot;His laughter ringing out has given courage to a downtrodden people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Canterbury Archbishop gave a special award, which he said he had long been planning to institute, to Tutu as its first recipient.  It is, Carey said, the Archbishop of Canterbury's award for outstanding service to the Anglican Communion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the World Council of Churches (WCC) paid tribute to retiring Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whom General Secretary Dr. Konrad Raiser described as a gift to the ecumenical movement and WCC in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The message from the WCC General Secretary was presented by Rev. Dr.  Alan Falconer, Director of Faith and Order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On behalf of the WCC, its Central Committee, commissions and staff, Dr.  Raiser paid tribute to &quot;the incredible faith and hope which emanates from this man (Tutu) who has spurred on the veterans, stirred the complacent and inspired the young.  He challenged and goaded and, so often, laughed and laughed until we cried.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recalling Archbishop Tutu's compelling vitality, humour and challenge as he addressed the 1994 WCC Central Committee in Johannesburg, Raiser noted that after years of exclusion, &quot;the WCC had finally returned with joy and thanksgiving to South African soil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC General Secretary also thanked Tutu's family whose constant support helped to keep the Bishop strong and well for his onerous tasks.  &quot;With gratitude we acknowledge the central role of (his wife) Leah, whose loving care and understanding sustained the Archbishop and enabled him to carry on,&quot; added Dr. Raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) also thanked Bishop Tutu for his commitment to the continental church body which he has served as President since 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Mary Jalan'go AACC Vice-President representing the Eastern Africa region, read the message on behalf of General Secretary Rev. Jose Chipenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his capacity as President of the umbrella church body, Tutu has &quot;piloted the ecumenical ship very safely&quot; and &quot;demonstrated excellent church diplomacy,&quot; said the AACC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AACC also highlighted Tutu's concern for peace and reconciliation in Africa, saying he has been a &quot;roving ambassador on behalf of the churches.  He has visited many countries to promote dialogue and reduce civil strife.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mandela also presented an award to Tutu: the Order of Meritorious Service (Gold), one of the country's most distinguished civilian honours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The award is made for exceptionally meritorious service in the public interest, and the citation called Tutu &quot;a champion of justice, truth and righteousness, and a fearless opponent of injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela in his address referred to Tutu's readiness to take unpopular positions without fear, and said that he speaks his mind on matters of public morality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a result, he annoyed many of the leaders of the apartheid system.  Nor has he spared those that followed -- he has from time to time annoyed many of us who belong to the new order,&quot; said the South African Head of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To laughter, the president added: &quot;But such independence of mind -- however wrong and unstrategic it may be at times -- is vital to a thriving democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu, in a tearful speech, thanked all those who had supported him throughout his ministry.  He thanked his dean, and his vicar- general, his predecessor Archbishop Philip Russel, and his wife and family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told President Mandela: &quot;You are a precious gift to this land. You are a precious gift to the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States President Bill Clinton stated in a message that Tutu epitomised the process of triumphant, democratic transformation.  He was a leader in both struggle and reconciliation, Clinton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a video message, American comedian Bill Cosby asked: &quot;How do you retire from God?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thanksgiving service was an eclectic mixture of African and Anglican ritual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu, resplendent in a shining brocade robe, gave his final blessing in Xhosa, before leading his distinguished guests to sign a book of farewell.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has analysed the consequences of donor withdrawal from Zambia and forecast a major economic collapse if the trend is not reversed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But government has insisted on taking a resolute stand condemning donors for tying political strings to economic programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a June 13 report released by the UNDP last week, the flow of external aid to Zambia is dependent on adherence to &quot;positive social, economic, and political reforms including the dictates of multi-party democracy and good governance&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report also revealed that the UNDP programmes in Zambia might be adversely affected by donor withdrawals, especially those which are co-financed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, finance minister Ronald Penza last Saturday insisted that the government has fulfilled its economic and financial benchmarks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are now waiting for the donors to fulfill their obligations. If they do not pay I shall fail to service debts and the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Programme will have been seen to have failed,&quot; he said. &quot;I am now waiting for my cheque.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the report circulated to all major embassies, including the British, United States, German, and Norwegian embassies, said the recent constitutional and political developments in the country have raised the possibility of withdrawal of donor assistance, mainly the balance of payments support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This would put SAP and the overall economic recovery programme in disarray,&quot;read the report. &quot;The country's export earnings are insufficient to meet the country's critical import needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But economists and other market players are already pointing to the escalating exchange rate over the past few weeks as evidence of economic collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One US dollar now costs K1,350 compared to K1,000 three months ago.  With the Kwacha falling and interest rates rising, the economy is going back into recession. There will be further job losses and misery,&quot; said Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) Economic Chairman, Rolf Shenton last Friday. &quot; Zambia simply cannot afford this to happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shenton added that &quot;the people of this country have swallowed the bitter pill over the last five years to enable the MMD to manage a Structural Adjustment Programme&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meebelo Mutukwa, an economist, said the country was in a deep crisis economically which needed immediate attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to realise that politics must fall second to the economy and we must not jeopardise our bright economic future,&quot; Mutukwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNDP report concluded that there are a number of donor-funded programmes in the social sector which would be affected by aid cuts, for example, health and education reforms. The agency hopes the withdrawal of aid should be selective to ease the plight of the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost all key western donors among them Norway, Britain, the United States of America, Denmark and Germany are witholding aid in protest against Zambias violation of the issues raised by the UNDP report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - United Nations special envoy on Angola peace talks, Alioune Blondin Beye, said last week that about 51,000 UNITA rebels had been registered for the National Army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beye was speaking in reply to a question asking him to confirm reports that UNITA rebels were getting arms through Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he could not confirm this but that out of the 62,500 rebels, as of Wednesday 51,000 had been integrated and that they had brought some arms with them. He added that Zaire was a sovereign nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the last few weeks, there has been some peace. Dr Jonas Savimbi (UNITA rebel leader) assured us that there would be peace. At least now there are no 1,000 people dying in Angola every day,&quot; Beye said in an interview on Friday. &quot;The commitment made by UNITA is being implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba in welcoming Beye said Zambia had heard the difficulties that he was going through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our role here is to try and listen from you the message of peace and to let us know what we can do to further strengthen the peace in Angola,&quot; President Chiluba said. &quot;We are very hopeful that peace is coming in Angola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beye said the 600 Zambian soldiers sent to Angola had been deployed at the Angola/Namibia border and had done an excellent job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the commandant had decided to send Zambian troops to that particular border because Zambia has good relations with Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN secretary general, Boutros Boutros Ghali, in a May 22, 1996 letter to the Zambian UN representative, Peter Lesa Kasanda, expressed his gratitude for Zambia's participation in the peace-keeping mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The dedicated and exemplary manner in which soldiers from your country performed this difficult and delicate operation, often under adverse conditions, met with the highest standards of international service and reflect great credit on your country and its armed forces,&quot; the letter read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beye also touched on the subject of Savimbi's vice-presidential appointment in the new Angolan government. He said this particular question has been an object of public discussion but there are still some details to be finalised before it is implemented and this may be at the extraordinary congress to be held by UNITA in August.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has turned down the US$40,000 deal with Zambia Breweries saying the amount involved is too small, it has been learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's international consultant John Fashanu is said to have made the observation that the amount the Mosi company had offered was too small and advised FAZ to put off the deal in which Zambia Breweries had offered to sponsor the national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Fashanu observed that the US$40,000 Zambia Breweries were offering us was too small and asked them to increase the money or forget about sponsoring the national team,&quot; said an official who attended the meeting held between FAZ officials and Zambia Breweries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources indicated that Fashanu insisted on putting off the deal considering that Zambia as Africa's highest rated team could not be getting anything less than what South Africa national team was getting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa is sponsored by Anglo-American Company, the same firm that owns Zambia Breweries and South African Breweries. So Fashanu wondered how the money for Zambia could be that small when South Africa gets about US$400,000 a year,&quot; said a source who disclosed that Fashanu, who also represents the Tanzanian Football Association is trying to nullify a similar deal signed by Anglo-American's Tan- zania's Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Anglo-American must be realistic that FAZ spends about US$40,000 on one trip and how can they offer that amount for a year? I think Fashanu must also go and modify the Tanzanian deal,&quot; suggested a soccer official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mpashi who confirmed that the meeting was held last Tuesday, suggested only Zambia Breweries could issue a press statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had a meeting with Zambia Breweries officials but if you want information, get in touch with Breweries officials as they are the ones to talk on that,&quot; said Mpashi in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when asked for a comment Augustine Seyuba, said he will need some time to make any comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Get in touch with me say after a week's time, that is when I will be in a position to make any comments,&quot; Seyuba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the officials who attended the meeting included FAZ general secretary, Hermann Mpashi, his assistant Julio Chiluba, John Fashanu and one of his local assistants, Zambia Breweries' Augustine Seyuba who was in the company of another representative.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Informed sources indicated that FAZ decided to turn down the South Korean invitation extended to the soccer team because of short notice for the trip as well as the insufficient money on offer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The South Koreans through their agents in England, KAM Sports International, asked us to send our senior national team for a two-match friendly trip to Korea but we are unable to send the team because we got the notice rather late,&quot; said the source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But FAZ general secretary Hermann Mpashi, could not be reached for a comment on the trip as he was out of Lusaka on a private visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Koreans wanted to use the matches, in which the Zambians would have spent ten days in Korea as part of their preparations for the Olympics slated for Atlanta in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The source said the team had the trip put off because the US$20,000 the South Koreans offered for each match was not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could not allow to be paid a mere US$20,000 per game because our team is the highest ranked in Africa,&quot; disclosed the source.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Inter-Africa Network for Human Rights (Afronet) has condemned the use of live bullets for riot control saying such extreme force was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afronet executive director Ngande Mwanajiti said in an interview on Friday, in reaction to the violent dispersal of UNIP cadres at the Lusaka Magistrate's Court the previous day, that police knew various techniques of crowd control which they could have safely used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I see no reason for using live bullets because there are acceptable ways to disperse crowds and the police know how to peacefully deal with violent crowds,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanajiti said police should not use force at the slightest provocation and called for strict guidelines from the police command on when officers should fire at unarmed civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The gravity of the matter requires that the police high command should only give instructions to fire to officers who can defend such action,&quot; he said. &quot;The use of arbitrary force can only worsen an otherwise tense situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanajiti said police brutality made a mockery of the government's wish to establish a permanent human rights commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The call for a human rights commission is inconsistent with what is happening in the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia Civic Education Association chairperson Lucy Sichone, who braved bullets to rescue a girl who was being bludgeoned by paramilitary police during the confusion at the courts said in an interview on Friday that &quot;at the moment there is simply no morality or compassion. Zambia is in the worst category of violators.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda at a press briefing yesterday condemned the violent suppression of the riot by the police, saying their brutality was &quot;terrifying&quot; and reminiscent of the Apartheid South African police action against unarmed black demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We demand the immediate abolition of the MMD police cadres, they should go home, away from the people,&quot; he said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The riot erupted after principal resident magistrate Francis Nsokolo rejected an application by lawyers representing the eight UNIP members facing treason charges that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) should appear to explain the state of the docket police claim has been sent to his chambers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The application came after defense lawyers were told by the DPP he has not received any docket on the matter but police kept on telling them it was with him. The defense feels the state is not ready with the case and just wants to use the unbailable treason charges to detain UNIP members without declaring a state of emergency which empowers the President to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 20,000 spectators watched the finals at the National Stadium in Sururele, a Lagos neighbourhood, with the 100 metre race for men and women as major highlights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chioma came second behind Onyali-Omagemi in the 100-metre women's race and picked up the gold in the long jump.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mufulira - Rather than cow in a cocoon of fear and despair that the competition brought about by the opening of the southern trade route would wipe them out, the Tanzania Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) and its partners on the Dar-es-Salaam corridor have decided to meet the challenge head on and plan on how to win the battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TAZARA which for years enjoyed the monopoly of being the only rail outlet for Zambia to sea now has to cope with stiff competition from the southern route, which under the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) became practically impossible for Zambia to use due to political reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the liberation of countries in Southern Africa and the opening of free trade in the region, however, the inevitable had to happen. Flow of traffic on the corridor was affected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traffic on the TAZARA has since reduced drastically and operations are just over 50 percent capacity level according to TAZARA deputy managing director Mr Ernest Mulokozi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Mulokozi told a visiting team of Zambian pressmen in Dar-es-Salaam recently Zamcargo haulage on the TAZARA had fallen from about one million tonnes of cargo per annum in 1992-93 to about 600,000 tonnes today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the task for his company now was to try and improve the situation through attraction of more customers by offering competitive freight conditions and dealing with customers on an individual basis while leaving room for negotiation. So far customer response has been encouraging, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prime objective of all the actors on the Dar-es-Salaam corridor now is to operate more efficiently as a single train while capitalising on the fact that the route still offers the shortest altenative to sea for a number of countries in central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far as Zambia is concerned, the port of Dar-es-Salaam is nearest in terms of distance compared to other South African ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The distance between Dar-es-Salaam and Lusaka by rail for instance is 2150 kilometres while Dar and the Copperbelt is 1650 km on the other hand, the distance between Lusaka and Cape Town is 3100 kilometres, Lusaka to Maputo is 2007 kilometres and Lusaka to Lobito is 2700 kilometres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director-General of the Tanzania Harbours Authority (THA) Mr Samson Luhingo echoed Mr Mulokozi's sentiments saying the entire corridor will have to exploit the shorter distance advantage that the routeenjoys over the other routes of the south to survive the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a major factor on the corridor, the rail is committed to providing the best services for customer satification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TAZARA works out survival plan two Mufulira Mr Luzingo said that competition that was now being posed by the southern routes was in fact healthy and good for business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We are not going to dig a grave and bury ourselves just because the south has opened up to business and is posing a big challenge for us. We are taking on the challenge,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the onset of free trade especially with the south, the quality of service provided on the Dar-es-Salaam corridor has tremendously improved, triggered of course by the rising talent of competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transit time for cargo from Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) to the port of Dar and unto the ship for instance has been reduced from an average of three weeks to under two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zamcargo Tanzania regional manager, Mr Andrew Musonda, said that the future for the corridor was bright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said for the first time in years, Zambian copper was able to move from source to the port in just under two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Operations on the Dar corridor are on the road to improvement because all players, that is Zambia Railways, TAZARA and the Tanzania Harbours Authority are working as a single chain for the benefit on the customers,'' Mr Musonda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The players in the corridor meet quarterly to map out strategies of continued survival in view of the now existing competitive market. The last meeting was on May 1 in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Musonda said that there was in fact room for further improvement of transit time on the TAZARA and as soon as this was achieved, the entire corridor would offer more advantages than any other route for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the saying goes, the taste of the pudding is in eating it. The factors on the dar corridor are challenging importers and exporters in these parts of the Africa to try their service. They may never regret it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Finance and Economic Development Minister, Ronald Penza, today maintained that Zambia has not breached any conditions of good governance for the developed donor countries to cut development aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation radio programme &quot;Tell the Nation&quot; programme this morning, Mr Penza said Zambia has not interfered with any fundamental human right enshrined in the constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the problem was with international co-operating partners who have a different perception of the newly assented constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Penza, therefore, called on Zambians to work hard to make the economy in the country vibrant rather than keep talking of the constitution which has already been assented to. He said Zambians had the responsibility of developing the economy and of creating an enabling environment in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Penza said Zambia was not poor in the real sense except that she has a huge debt left behind by former Republican President, Dr Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile Mr Penza has urged police not to detain people if they had no evidence, saying this only embarrased the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra - Ghanaian leader, Jerry Rawlings and Kow Arkaah, the vice-president, are set to clash in what could be an acrimonious presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Months back Jerry Rawlings, the Ghanaian president, hit the headlines on turning his vice, Kow Nkensen Arkaah, into a punching bag during a heated argument in the cabinent chambers. Many observers were shocked by the barbaric act and wondered why Rawlings would not choose the more honourable option of sacking Arkaah if relations between them had completely broken down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact, however, is that Rawlings' hands are tied by the 1992 constitution which midwifed the return of democracy in Ghana after years of military misrule. According to the constitution, the president and his vice must work together under all circumstances and must leave office together, except one dies or the other resigns. What that means is that the president cannot sack the vice-president. If the vice-president chooses not to resign his appointment, he could only be removed by impeachment or a referendum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the &quot;marriage&quot; between Rawlings and Arkaah is an unholy one. The two men come from different political parties. Rawlings is of the National Democratic Coalition while Arkaah joined the cabinet on the platform of the National Convention Party, with which the NDC struck an alliance after the last elections. Worse, both the president and his vice are temperamental and see things from different perspectives. In the circumstances, conflcits and disagreements over how the country should be governed, how policies should be implemented and how issues are to be handled, have become a part of life in the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That Rawlings and Arkaah do not think alike could be partly attributed to the generation gap that exists between them. While Rawlings is a young, active man in his early 50s, Arkaah is 68. Besides, both men come from contrasting backgrounds: Rawlings is a career soldier who rose to the rank of flight lieutenant in the Ghanaian Air Force before he became head of state in 1979; Arkaah is a technocrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ultimate showdown between the two strange bedfellows is expected to take place this December when they square off in the presidential elections.  For Arkaah, the road to a shot at the presidency was cleared June 9 when his new party, the People's Convention Party, voted him its presidential candidate for the elections, slated for December 10. He polled 952 votes, representing 62.7 percent of the total votes cast to beat six others at the PCP's first National Delegates Conference held at the Great Hall of the University of Ghana, Legon, Accra. Arkaah's victory did not, however, go down well with everyone. His opponents refused to accept defeat. They accused Arkaah of buying votes and of using the power of incumbency to influence the election results. Some argued taht he should have resigned as vice-president before the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was an elated and unruffled Arkaah that mounted the rostrum minutes after the results were announced to address the press. &quot;I am very happy today,&quot; he told the newsmen. &quot;The election was life and death for me.  My victory is very important. Now I can resign (his appointment as vice-president) and damn that boy called Rawlings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next day the pro-Rawlings Ghana Palaver newspaper took on Arkaah, dismissing him as &quot;a rolling stone that gathers no moss.&quot; According to the newspaper, Arkaah has hardly served for more than three years with any firm organisation in his working life. &quot;The only exception,&quot; say the paper, &quot;seems to be the vice-presidency, and even here, it is believed that the vice-president had hoped for a miraculous elevation to the presidency by the third year in office. This probably accounts for his frustration at not making it this time around which found vent in undermining the government of which he is vice-president, even after his party had abrogated the alliance with the NDC which gave him the vice-presidency on a platter of gold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arkaarh's currculum vitae casts him in the mould of an adventurous soul, as it shows that he worked for short spells in Ghana, Sierra Leone and The Gambia before he went into politics. He was educated at Harvard University, U.S.A. and was once a consultant to the United Nations. Among the firms Arkaah has worked with are PZ in Sierra Leone, for less than three years, before it collapsed in the 1970's; a trading company in The Gambia, where he was asked to leave after a short spell; and Ghana Airways, for a year. Arkaah later worked for two years with International Trading Operations, Ghana from 1986-88; three months as a consultant in Ethiopia; one year as a consultant with Johnson Products and nine months with the Economic Commission for Africa. He then returned to Ghana to work for a year with Ghana Airways, and for about three years with GNTC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever may be his faults, Arkaah's new party, the PCP, believes that he is the best material they have to contest the presidency against Rawlings.  As Ghanaians prepare to go to the polls to elect a new president and parliament to usher in the fourth republic in line with the 1992 constitution, the air is heavy with political bitterness. Candidates who have just emerged from the party primaries, and even the parties themselves, are using the polarised press to haul brickbats at their opponents. There are three major parties in the race for Osu Castle, another name for the presidential mansion. They are Arkaah's PCP, Rawlings' NDC and J.A. Kufuor's New Patriotic Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the elections draw near, the PCP and NPP are whipping up traditional sentiments in a desperate bid to upstage the ruling party. Both claim to be offshoots of Kwame Nkrumah's political dynasty and therefore expect elderly Ghanaians to vote for them as they would have done for Nkrumah, if he were still alive and contesting the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This sentiment could perhaps have had some meaning if the presidential candidates had the same charisma or organisational ability as Nkrumah, the Osafyefo. The PCP, for one, was only able to hold its primaries after a long delay and not less than seven candidates contested. Arkaah's victory in the elections that climaxed a very bitter and rancorous campaigns has been rejected by all the defeated candidates, leaving the party more divided than before. The NPP had earlier elected John Agyekum Kufuor as its presidential candidate under similar acrimonious circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As they did in 1992, the PCP and NPP have agreed to form an alliance against Rawlings. As early as October 1995, the two parties had signified their interest in merging to get Rawlings out of office. But internal bickerings may mar this brillant political strategy. For instance, the defeated presidential aspirants in PCP are yet to accept Arkaah as their presidential candidate and are not ready to support him. Instead, they are calling on him to resign his appointment as vice-president, a call he is not ready to heed. A more serious problem facing the alliance is the question of who to choose as a common presidential candidate. Although both Kufuor and Arkaah have in seperate interviews pledged to respect the wishes of the party members, who are expected to choose a presidential candidate for the alliance, observers believe that a rather gregarious Arkaah may not easily accept defeat if the primaries turn against him. Kufuor, too, is likely to cry foul if he loses to Arkaah. This is likely to weaken the alliance and strengthen Rawlings' chances of returning to Osu Castle for a second four-year term as Ghana's elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the apparent disunity in the parties, Rawlings' power of incumbency is a major factor that could work in his favour. While the other politicans are still struggling for support at the party level, Rawlings and his very active wife keep moving from village to village at the grassroot level, commissioning one completed project or the other, or establishing new ones, using such opportunities to campaign for re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the other parties are still trying to get their acts together, Rawlings' NDC has already started campaigning nationwide through newspaper and television advertisments, using powerful slogans to convince voters that Rawlings is still the answer to Ghana's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A more important factor in Rawlings favour is his attitude towards the aggressive and insultive opposition presion. With all the provocation, Rawlings has tolerated the opposition press and is likely to do so till at least the end of the elections, so as not to be branded as a dictator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the final analysis, a Rawlings victory in December may not necessarily lie in his strength as a much loved candidate, but in the weakness of his opponents who seem to have aged and style very much against him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The death, in a plane crash, of Mohammed Wase, military administrator of Kano State and 11 others once more brings into focus the poor state of aviation facilities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian government and aviation officials are becoming wiser by the day with each fatal aircrash involving prominent personalities. Since the death of Ibrahim Abacha, son of the head of state, and 13 others in January 17 presidential plane crash in Kano, official reaction had stopped blaming every air disaster in the country on &quot;an act of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The early morning fatal plane crash that killed Mohammed Abdullahi Wase, a colonel and administrator of Kano Sate and 11 others, June 19, was from all indications, not an act of God.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chartered 19 seater Gulf Stream II, with registration number VRD-BLJ reportedly took off from Kano airport at 7.01 a.m. for Jos, Plateau State, that fateful Thursday. Wase and his entourage had left early enough ostensibly to condole his father on the death of another of his sons, Bashir, before attending the commissioning of some projects in his home town of Wase by Ishaya Bamaiyi, Chief of Army Staff. Accompanying Wase on the trip were Mohammed Vice Adamu, special duties commissioner; Dambo Gambo, managing director of state housing corporation; Sulaiman Dambata, a director general of the government house; Eli Atabor, a captain and aide-de-camp to Wase; as well as Jauru Awak, a corporal and Wase's orderly. Others were Sule Batsari and Mohammed Mohammed, friends of the administrator, John Howell, the pilot and Allen Taylor, the co-pilot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirty minutes later, the journey was about to end on a successful note when the first sign of tragedy suddenly appeared in the skies. The weather was foggy and the British-born pilot had problems landing in the poorly equipped Jos airport. The Instruments Landing System at the airport packed up way back in February 1991, leaving pilots familiar with the environment to navigate their way by instinct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suddenly aware that the ILS, which guides safe landing through data information to pilots, was out of order, Howell was said to have radioed the control tower to announce his intention to brave the odds. This was after he had missed the runway in his first attempt to land. Warned to be careful as visibility was low at 250 feet, a far cry from the normal 800 feet, Howell sought alternative information from the pilot of a Kabo aircraft waiting to take off. The comrade's information was not different from that of the control tower. Howell then tried to find a route to approach the runway for safe landing. That was the fatal decision. In his attempt to land, the plane hit the transmission towers of the Nigerian telecommunications PLc in Kassa village 42 kilometers from Jos, exploded in mid-air before crash landing in flames. All occupants were mangled beyond recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A pistol, a magazine and a cellular phone set were found in the wreckage. Mohammed Mana, Plateau State administrator who supervised operations at the airport, directed that the found items be kept with security agents. All the Nigerian victims were buried a few hours later according to Muslim rites, at Zaria Road Cemetery, while the bodies of the pilots were deposited at the Jos morgue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sani Abacha, head of state and Oladipo Diya, chief of general staff, led a large number of mourners from the presidency and the cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no immediate official statement on the accident. Samuila Nakama, director general of Federal Aviation Authority who immediately travelled to Jos airport in company of his managing director, Sani Baba, however, said that the crash could have been caused by engine or weather problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though 31-years old, the aircraft, run for the past 15 years by NANCO, a member of the Dantanta business empire of Kano, reportedly had a history of good health. This made it the choice aircraft of several dignitaries such as emirs, businessmen and state officials like Wase, who regularly used it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born in 1948 at Wase, some kilometers from his death place, Wase in 1993 briefly served as sole administrator of National Electoral Commission following the sack of its chairman, Humphrey Nwosu, after the annulment of the June 12 presidential election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The administration's suspicions turn to former President Ibrahim Babangida on the June 4 Murder of Kudirat Abiola. Is this a case of calling a dog a bad name?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If it were a religious schism, then some of the rising pressure in the cauldron could be let off by break-away factions. This time, the object in the pressure cooker is far from spiritual, it is one apparently with no safety valve, welling up as it were from the grossest of banal passions - power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chief characters in the live soap opera about to unfold before drama-loving Nigerians are the military quartet of Sani Abacha, head of state, Ibrahim Babangida, Muhammadu Buhari, and Tunde Idiagbon. Apart from the very brief interregnum of Ernest Shonekan's interim government, all three have ruled Nigeria except for Idiagbon, who served as Buhari's side-kick.  Ironically, it is Abacha and Babangida - mentor and protege - that are pitted against each other, with the pair of Buhari and Idiagbon playing a supporting role on Abacha's side.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 4, the opera reached a dramatic flashpoint with the murder of Kudirat, wife of the detained politician, Moshood Abiola. A source who was with Abacha on that day when the news was broken to him said the head of state was crestfallen. According to the source, Abacha's immediate response was: &quot;My God.&quot; After a prolonged silence, he muttered, &quot;Why have they done this to me?&quot; A few days after Kudirat was shot to death on the streets of Lagos, a politician visited one of the topmost officials of the administration at Aso Rock. In the course of their discusiions, what looked like an answer to Abacha's question started to emerge. The official told his guest that the the government was damn sure that the intention of the killers of Kudirat was to embarrass the administration and to strengthen its already odious reputation at home and abroad. As if answering Abacha's question on hearing of the assassination, the official said the administration was of the suspicion that the mastermind was Babangida whom he accused of being capable of incalculable mischief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the thinking of the official, part of that mischief may have to do with eliminating Kudirat to prevent her struggle for the restoration of the presidential mandate of Abiola which Babangida annulled in 1993 and consequently forced him to vacate the presidency prematurely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was that suspicion that shaped government's reaction. The day after the assassination, the head of state expressed government's determination to track down the killers. That was followed immediately by a condolence message in which Abacha poured fulsome eulogies on the slain Kudirat as a caring mother with the virtues of a motivator and counsellor and one whose death at this time of Nigeria's political development was a loss to the nation. That same day, the government despatched a 10-man delegation to condole the Abiola family. To give effect to its words, the administration immediately constituted an investigating team to be headed by Archibong Nkana, the deputy inspector-general of police in charge of the Federal Investigations and Intelligence Bureau. Apart from a genuine desire to apprehend the killers, the official told his visiting friend that the government's uncharacteristically swift response was aimed at ensuring that the agent provocateur did not realise his intention and to assure the international community that it was blameless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now, the administration seems to be handling its suspicion with utmost care. Even so, Theweek learnt that Babangida was summoned to Abuja immediately after the news of Kudirat's assassination. A source close to Aso Rock says that on June 5, the day after the murder, Babangida had an audience with the head of state. What transpired at the meeting is still a secret but the source conjectured that Abacha may have summoned the former head of state either to size him up or to broach the subject of his suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Abacha pursues the present line of suspicion, it could only lead to a climax of a long simmering clash that started the very day Babangida stepped out of office on August 26, 1993. Three years after, the mystery of how Abacha survived Babangida in government continues to persist. There are varied conjectures. One version has it that Babangida's precipitate departure was forced on him by rumours of an impending coup. He was said to have felt that even if he were out of office, the coup could still occur and rebound on him. To stave off that eventuality, he left Abacha behind to contain any possible insurrection. Another says that in the twilight days of his regime, Babangida had lost out to Abacha in the game of loyalist in the military hierarchy. And when Abacha insisted on staying behind, Babangida had no choice but to leave him alone. And yet another which seemed to have the most plausibility was that when Babangida saw his going as inevitable, he installed Abacha whom he regarded as his closest collaborator in government in the interim administration. In Babangida's reasoning, according to this version, Abacha who was then directly in line of succession to Shonekan was to serve as the surrogate that would enable him cling to power or stage a come-back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Babangida's intention was to hold onto power by whatever means, his designs soon exploded in his face. The day after he left office, he caused Duro Onabule - still styling himself the chief press secretary - to announce replacements for the service chiefs whom Babangida had forced into retirement with himself. Abacha, as secretary of defense, reacted swiftly by quashing the appointments, except for one or two that were agreeable to him. Next Abacha moved to dismantle Babangida's clique of loyalists within the military by retirements and redeployments. On November 17, Abacha received a purported letter of resignation from Shonekan and installed himself as head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's first actions as head of state were a clear signal that the Babangida era had truly come to an end. In his maiden broadcast the day he took over power, Abacha axed the parliament and all other democratic structures that were the monument to Babangida's eight-year transition programme. In addition, he promised to restructure the armed forces and to reform government establishments and parastatals, an euphemism for purging all the institutions of vestiges of Babangida's influence. That month, the new head of state sent 17 Babangida &quot;boys&quot; out of the armed forces into retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all this, the most telling blow was struck, not at the level of officaldom, but at the domestic front. On May 17, 1994, Maryam Babangida's object of obsession, the Better Life Programme, BLP, for which she won international awards, was brought down. In a memo on that day, Abubakar Abudullahi, writing on behalf of the principal secretary to the head of state direct that all posters, signboards and inscriptions bearing the BLP logo should be changed to reflect the new project - the Family Support Programme, FSP, the creation of Maryam Abacha, wife to the new head of state. The memo said the programme was changed because of &quot;the general public outcry against the BLP for its elitist, theorectical and flambuoyant nature and outlook, and the need to redefine the scope and objectives of the programme to conform with the practical realities and the mood of the nation.&quot; No indictment of licentiousness of the Babangida era could have been more scathingly phrased.  Even so, the more painful barb was to come in the renaming of the Maryam Babangida Centre and the change of the ownership structure to exclude the former First Lady completely from the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though it is difficult to put a finger exactly on the cause of the rift between Abacha and Babangida, it seems certain that it has to do with an erstwhile protege trying to assert to his former mentor that a new sun had arisen and that the ancient regime was dead for good. Having dealt with virtually all the high and mighty that could pose an opposition to him, the only man left that Abacha seems to be mortally afraid of is Babangida, an adept at creating pockets of civilian and military loyalists, a master tactician and strategist at coup-making, and above all, a man believed to be full of intrigues and guile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presence of Babangida is said to have been making Abacha acutely uncomfortable despite the numerous retirements and redeployments of civilian and military personnel in the past. Only now is he said to be feeling a little more secure with the conclusion of the recent mass retirements from the armed forces. Early on, Abacha had given a clear signal that he bore the former head of state a deep animus when he reportedly said that he was marginalised under the Babangida regime. Babangida was said to have been taken aback by that statement, coming from a supposedly bosom friend whom he used to refer to fondly as his co-collaborator in government. In fact, Babangida as president was said to have relied most on Abacha's advice in taking crucial decisions. So confounded was the former head of state that he was said to have confessed to his close associates that he didn't really know Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, more shocks have come the way of Babangida, the latest apparently being the suspicion of his complicity in Kudirat's murder. Only recently, the Kaduna State government took on Sunny Okogwu, the elder brother to Babangida's wife, Maryam. Ostensibly waging a war on tax evaders, the tax auditors have written to Okogwu to provide details of his business activities in Nigeria and abroad, including certified financial accounts of his companies. Furthermore, he was told to appoint a &quot;competent tax consultant who will liase between you and the tax authorities at the federal, state and local government levels, including appeals against assessment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Okogwu were to go by the words of Habib then his fate is a foregone conclusion. If the proposal of the state government is carried out, then Babangida's brother-in-law could be hauled before the miscellaneous offenses tribunal, tried and jailed as a common tax felon. For as Yakubu, executive chairman of the state's internal revenue board has declared, Okogwu has been filing false declarations of tax returns to the board in the past six years.  What seems intriguing in the Okogwu case is the interest of the board not only in knowing about his business in Kaduna State alone, but throughout Nigeria and abroad. And what is more, the directive to him to appoint a competent tax consultant to liase between him and the federal government.  Those who claim to be in the know see the action of the state government as that of a proxy to the federal authorities who may wish to get at Babangida eventually since he is believed to be in business partnership with his in-law. Okogwu had walked a similar path before. During the Buhari regime which Babangida overthrew, the government had shut down Okogwu's company in Kaduna because according to Buhari, &quot;there was an investigation by security agencies that a civilian outfit is growing out of a military establishment.&quot; If any was needed, Buhari's statement was proof that Babangida, at the time the chief of army staff, was hand-in-gloves with his brother in-law in business matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, whatever designs Abacha have on him, Babangida might ultimately perish by his own hubris. He triggered off his current travails more than a decage ago when he light-heartedly sacked Buhari's government on August 17, 1985. Though he was the regime's chief of army staff and highly visible member of the Supreme Military Council, Babangida turned round to castigate Buhari and Idiagbon in overflowing measures. In his coup-day manifesto, Babangida thundered that &quot;The principles of discussions, consultations and cooperation which should have guided the decision-making process of the SMC and the Federal Executive Council were disregarded soon after the government settled in 1984.&quot; Turning specifically on Buhari, he said it was regrettable that the former head of state &quot;was too rigid and uncompromising in his attitude to issues of national significance (and) efforts to make him understand that a diverse polity like Nigeria required recognition and appreciation of differences in both cultural and individual perspectives only served to aggravate these attitudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To Idiagbon, the vitriol was no less corrosive. His upbraiding of Idiagbon sounded like the appraisal of a junior officer. &quot;As chief of staff, Supreme Headquarters, he failed to exhibit the appropriate disposition demanded by his position.&quot; And castigating his pig-headedness, Babangida said Idiagbon &quot;arrogated to himself absolute knowledge of problems and solutions and acted in accordance with what was convenient to him, using the machinery of government as his tool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of that was understandable as the rationalisation of a man who forcibly took over power. What was not so clear was the severity of the punishment he inflicted on Buhari and Idiagbon thereafter. Immediatley he came to power, Babangida clamped Buhari into what he described as protective custody. He was to remain there for upward of three years until he was released in December 1988. Indeed, it was the death of his mother, Hajiya Julaiba Musa, who Buhari was not around to bury that finally moved the government into releasing him. In the meantime, Buhari's marriage to Safinatu had collasped, leading to a divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Idiagbon was on pilgrimage to Mecca when Babangida struck. Apparently encouraged by government's announcement that all political fugitives were free to return home, Idiagbon turned up in Nigeria in September 1985 and was promptly placed under house arrest in Bauchi. He was to regain his freedom on December 16, 1988, shortly after Buhari's release. Even so, the freedom of both men was partial as they were restricted to their local government areas and barred from speaking to the press. These restrictions were only lifted almost after a year in August 1989. This kind of treatment could only have sprung either from a pathological fear of the straight-arrowed duo or from vendetta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the sources, of the punitive measure, it strained the relationship between the erstwhile friends beyond repair. And Buhari who appeared to have suffered more personal losses took measured steps to demonstrated the depth of his angers even while Babangida was still in power.  The first public demonstration of Buhari's anger came on February 21, 1991 when Babangida paid an official visit to Daura, Buhari's hometown. He ensured that he was away to Kaduna days before Babangida called. As a former head of state and a Daura prince, Buhari was conspicuous by his absence at the civic reception for the then head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In less than four months afterwards, he had other occasions even on a grander scale to vent his spite. At the opening ceremony of the 27th summit of the Organisation of African Unity at Abuja in June 1991, Babangida proudly put on display Nigeria's surviving heads of state. The roll call: Yakubu Gowon, Olusegun Obasanjo and Shehu Shagari. Absent was Buhari. He confirmed that he received an invitation and would at a conducive time inform the people why he chose to abstain. Soon after, he took a blistering swipe at the Babangida transition programme on a BBC interview in his farm house in Daura.  Saying that the elections would not be free and fair, he predicted that &quot;people may elect candidate A while candidate X will emerge the winner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was not until 1993 in the dying days of the Babangida regime that Buhari came out full blast against his erstwhile tormentor. In an interview with The News in June that year, he described the government as totally lacking in credibility. His indictment: &quot;In terms of the Second Republic, we reached the same stage again. This present government has no credibility inside or outside the country.&quot; Attacking the administration for graft and corruption, he described Babangida's government as a &quot;hostage leadership&quot; whose interests were at variance with those of Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even with Babangida out of office, Buhari's icy attitude did not thaw.  When both men met for the first time since the August 1985 coup, the bostitlity was so thick as to be almost visible. The day was June 24, 1994 and the occasion was the simultaneous marriage ceremonies of seven daughters of Sani Zango Daura, a prominent Daura indigene. Buhari and Babangida arrived the Emir of Daura's palace, venue of the wedding, at different times and sat, one immediately to the left of the Emir and the other immediately to the right. The two former heads of state did not utter a word to each other. At the end of the ceremony, Buhari made to go away immediately but was halted by the Emir who introducted Babangida as his visitor. Buhari managed to limp a handshake and scurried to his home. Later, Babangida in the company of Shehu Yar'Adua and other dignitaries had to drive to Buhari's house in an attempt to heal the breach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reconciliation evidently didn't work. Less than four months after the Daura event, Buhair took his second public step to strike back at Babangida. The first of such moves occurred on November 5, 1994 during the launching of the Family Support Programme meant to erase the Better Life Programme of Babangida's spouse. Buhari's presence there was seen not only as an endorsement of the FSP but a vote of confidence on the BLP it was replacing. In that same month, the former head of state accepted to serve as the chairman of the administration's Petroleum Trust Fund, PTF. Buhari's chummy relationship with the administration is said to derive from his belief that &quot;Abacha could be encouraged to do the right thing.&quot; And doing the right thing in Buhari's mind is by &quot;bringing Babangida to book&quot; through probing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Idiagbon, unlike Buhari, did not utter a word publicly all the while that Babangida was in power. His first public utterance came on January 29 last year. At a lecture he chaired in Katsina to honour Buhari for the conferment of an honorary doctorate on him, Idiagbon, apparently referring to the locust years of Babangida lamented that &quot;General Buhari showed the torch but we refused to follow the light.&quot; He proceeded to narrate the pressures that were piled on Buhari to elevate himself to the rank of a four-star general and the numerous entreaties of various communities to bestow traditional titles on him, all to no avail. &quot;The policy of our administration,&quot; Idiagbon said, &quot;was that we should not honour ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in his moment of glory, Buhari could not help taking a swipe at his old foe. Dismissing accusations of having abused the trust reposed on him as Nigeria's leader, he declared: &quot;If the weakest point of a leader is abusing trust, I have less weakness than some of my colleagues that incarcerated me and labelled me as dishonest.&quot; Disclosing that he had declared his assets three times, he volunteered to do so again along with past Nigerian leaders.  His challenge: &quot;I invite my other colleagues, former heads of state to declare their own assets, including mine and the difference we have between what we have declared and what is worked out to be our legitimate earnings, let them take it over and prosecute us.&quot; The object of his baiting was obvious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha is apparently exploiting this animosity. It was what got Buhari to his side of the plot in the impending confrontation with Babangida. Using the logic that the enemy is my friend, Abacha has sought to draw Idiagbon into the foray. Theweek learnt that about two months ago, the adminstration approached Idiagbon with the offer of chairmanship of the failed contracts tribunal to be set up soon. Using tactics identified to those it adopted in getting Buhari to come on board, the government sent a delegation of eminent persons for whom Idiagbon has tremendous respect to Ilorin to try to persuade him to regard the offer as a service to the nation. In their attempts, members of the delegation tried to strike a responsive cord by appealing to him to aid in clearing the scandalous mess of abandoned contracts now depriving the masses of needed infrastructure and services. At a stage they even restorted to subtle flattery; that the new government measures were actually lifted from Buhari-Idiagbon era when probity and accountability in government business was a public policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, Idiagbon remains unpersuaded. It is said that Buhari had advised against the offer because Idiagbon is yet to be convinced that the political atmosphere was conducive for him to venture into public life. That was precisely the answer with which he politely warded off the delegation. As a source put it, &quot;Idiagbon definitely understands the forces at play in this government, and having suffered incarceration once, does not wish to suffer it again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The administration is said to have been surprised that Idiagbon did not eagerly accept the job from where he would be in a eminent position to deal with Babangida and the acolytes who received patrongage from him. It is believed that any serious probe of failed contracts would thorougly discredit the Babangida era, if not taint his person indelibly. Perhaps, it was the belief that Idiagbon would finally come around to the government side that made Abacha to announce the proposed setting up of the panel with fanfare last month. There is no doubt that Idiagbon's participation in such would have enhanced its credibility to no ends. During his brief sojourn on the national landscape, he came to represent for Nigerians, the quintessence of honesty, integrity and all that is noble. His long hibernation from the public has only added to his mystic. It is all these qualities that the Abacha government has tried to exploit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the administration would push its suspicions of Babangida to the logical conclusion or employ other weapons in the simmering face-off is as yet uncertain. What seems clear, however, is that the killing of Kudirat has affected the government in a fundamental sense. Unlike in the past when discussions of Abiola's freedom is rebuffed by the government with inflexible determination, it now seems sobered enough to give serious consideration to the issue. An authoritative source has told Theweek that the head of state himself has directed Oyebade-Lipede, the Alake of Egba-Land, from where the detained politician hailed, to hold a meeting urgently with the Abiola family to discuss the modalitites for the release of the head of the household. It is not clear whether the police would have to release such arrested members of the family as are necessary for the discussion with the Abiola family. It is said that Abacha wants to meet with the Alake alone and nobody else.  According to the source, the presidency has asked that everything should be done to ensure that Lipede who is said to be slightly indisposed gets to Aso Rock for the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the investigating police team last week, it was routine as usual as it continued to invite scores of persons who were known to have been close to the deceased in one way or the other while she was alive. If that is the signpost of the future, then the only good that may turnout, if it can called one, is that Kudirat used her blood as a ransom for Abiola's freedom.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The National Empowerment Consortium, which isheading the bid for a stake in Times Media Limited's owner,Johnnic, has trashed the idea of an editorial charter as long asit remains a pre-condition of sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyril Ramaphosa, who is soon to be executive deputy chairman ofNew Africa Investments Limited (Nail), snubbed TML management byrejecting its idea for an editorial charter which was presented tohim for his seal of approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The editors have publicly declared the charter as a means of&quot;preserving age-old traditions and editorial integrity&quot; and withthis they tried to seduce Ramaphosa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he acknowledged that editorial independence wasimportant, Ramaphosa indicated a polite thanks, but no thanks.Sources close to Ramaphosa say both the owners and editors of TMLpresented the idea of an editorial charter as part of thetransaction, but that Ramaphosa would not budge on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that Ramaphosa is perplexed by the fact thatthe charter is a matter of urgency for TML with prospective newowners, but it was not -- and still remains -- a non-issue withthe editors during the course of their current dealings withJohnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a source, it emerged during the course ofdiscussion between Ramaphosa and the editors that an immediateendorsement by Ramaphosa for the charter would smooth ongoingnegotiations on the unbundling of Johnnic considerably, especiallysince a hard bargain is being driven by Johnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa remains unconvinced by this and will continue towithhold his consent on the charter, insiders say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Ramaphosa expresses support for editorialindependence, the urgency for a charter suggested an uneasiness onthe part of TML at the prospect of black owners. TML managingdirector Roy Paulson says the charter was drawn up and handed toAnglo American, but he has no knowledge of whether it was handedover to Ramaphosa. In fact, the idea has been conveyed toRamaphosa on several occasions during the ongoing talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To some media observers, the &quot;chickens have come home to roostfor TML&quot;.  An insider, privy to negotiations between TML and NewNation two years ago, says TML management belittled the idea of aneditorial charter when New Nation requested one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the source, Paulson attempted to ensure that TMLwould have had editorial control over and above a New Nationeditorial charter, under instruction from executives at Omni Mediaand Johnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's ironic that when they were negotiating they agreed to aneditorial charter as long as they still maintained editorialcontrol. For the publicity's sake, they even offered us 51% of thedeal but they wanted to hold the reins. Now the time for TML hascome, they are shaking in their boots and are pushing for acharter in desperation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paulson rejected these claims, saying that although he didapproach New Nation, TML's intentions were honourable. &quot;It'stotally untrue that we offered New Nation a stake in the company.TML went in to buy the company and it would have been wholly ownedby us,&quot; Paulson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We respected their editorial independence and even had noproblems with them supporting the African National Congress aslong as it did not impinge on the commercial viability of thepublication,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Nation editor Gabu Tugwana confirmed there was a &quot;problem&quot;which resulted in a breakdown in talks but refused to divulgedetails.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Independent Newspapers' magazine Sunday Life maybe sued by Time Warner, proprietor of the Life trademark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bob Scherer of the Trademark Council, a division of Time Warnerin the United States, says talks are under way with IndependentNewspapers' management, and although talk of a lawsuit may be &quot;abit premature&quot;, the issue is &quot;far from resolved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Law firm Adams &amp; Adams, representing Time Warner, may have aconflict of interest since the firm also represents IndependentNewspapers. Because of this conflict, Adams &amp; Adams may have toabandon representing Time Warner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source at the firm says Time Warner has not yet institutedproceedings, and Independent Newspapers must meet certainconditions in a bid to settle out of court. &quot;It's difficult toprove trademark infringement and the matter may have to benegotiated further,&quot; an insider said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another adds that the issue at stake is whether or not theoriginal trademark was copied and the defendant has to prove thatit was not; alternatively, the plaintiff has to prove that it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talks between the two parties have been ongoing for the pastyear. Sunday Life editor Les Aupiais says, as far as she knows, itwas agreed Sunday Life will abide by certain conditions. These arethat the magazine will not be sold as a stand-alone with a coverprice, the name will not be printed in white on a red backgroundas in the original Life magazine and that it will always have theprefix &quot;Sunday&quot; before &quot;Life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The magazine will always be a supplement to the main bodynewspaper,&quot; says Aupiais, adding that the typeface of the magazinewas also specially designed for the magazine and is nothing likethat of the original Life trademark. &quot;The typeface of Sunday is=46irmin Didot and Life is in Doric. It was not copied from theoriginal Life magazine,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Managing director of Cape Newspapers Rory Wilson told the Mail&amp; Guardian that Time Warner approached the stable some months agowhere they stated their case. &quot;We then took counsel's opinion onthe matter and we are not infringing any trademark. We are holdingby that,&quot; Wilson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Newspapers' sales and marketing manager Greg Brophyconfirms that legal counsel was sought. He says Sunday Life aretwo generic words which do not infringe on the trademark of Lifemagazine. &quot;We have pumped lots of money into the marketing ofSunday Life and before that was done we ensured that we were onsolid ground in terms of ethics and legal aspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive director of the Association of Marketeers DerekDickens says trademarks and brands are what the free market is allabout and well-known trademarks, for this reason, have to beprotected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dickens, the Trademarks Act in South Africa is &quot;alot more lax&quot; than in other countries. However, it is adequate toprotect local and international brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of Sunday Life and Time Warner boils down to whetherSunday Life was registered under the old Trademarks Act, whichallowed for South Africans to register trademarks as long as theywere not well- known locally, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early Nineties, with the formation of the EuropeanEconomic Council, there was an international effort to harmoniseall trademark laws across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an effort to keep in line with international trends, SouthAfrica brought its own old-fashioned trademarks act into line withworld standards.  Now, with the old act repealed, the new Actinsists that a trademark can only be registered once a worldwidesearch of brands is conducted by the applicant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;America has put pressure on South Africans who harbourtrademarks under the old Act. We have to get in line and respectinternational trademarks and make sure they are protected in thiscountry as we risk losing favoured nation status,&quot; Dickens says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A case in point is the international McDonalds versusMacdonalds, says Dickens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 34.2 of the new Trademarks Act states that the rightsof a trademark will be infringed if there is an unauthorisedidentical or similar mark in the form of shape, colour or name,that so nearly resembles another trademark that it is likely to beperceived as such or cause confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dicken argues that Time Warner in all probability has a strongcase unless Independent Newspapers registered its Sunday Life logounder the old Act. He says the stable's counsel will then have toprove that the two brands cannot be confused. but with the new actin place, the newspaper house will have to get in line.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Investors should not be put off shares justbecause the Johannesburg Stock Exchange has taken a beating thanksto the rand's tumble.  Rather, now is a good time to buy, saysSchalk Theron, senior portfolio manager of Sanlam Unit Trusts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The average annual after-tax return on shares over 20 yearsfar exceeds that of other investments, so investors should take along-term view and consider the softening of the JSE as a buyingopportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be silly for a regular monthly investor todiscontinue buying, because one can get more units for the sameamount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares are by their very nature volatile. But investors shouldnot judge unit trust performance over periods of less than threeyears, says Theron.  &quot;Chasing returns over shorter periods becomestoo risky for prudent portfolio management,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, gold funds would have yielded a 30% return in thelast quarter - but over a five-year term, that would havetranslated into 10%, as against the 25% return an industrial trustwould have yielded at a much lower level of risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the fundamentals continue to look good. &quot;I do not think theshare market is overvalued. I am bullish about prospects forgrowth,&quot; says Theron.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's high capital intensity was, in part, due to theemergence of large and powerful public and private sectorconglomerates that &quot;have become deeply locked into our economicstructure and will resist policy interventions that attempt totransform it&quot;. These had developed because of sanctions and theneed to ensure self-sufficiency, while gaining access to securesources of foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new government had an entirely different set of prioritiesand concerns, not least job creation for the large pool ofunskilled and semi-skilled labour and the better use of capitaland skilled labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This did not imply that government should not support largeprojects now being planned, but &quot;every effort&quot; should be made toensure that as many upstream and downstream jobs as possible werecreated at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current focus on development corridors clearly representsan attempt to generate sustainable employment clustered aroundinfrastructural development and is welcomed,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move to create more jobs should be accompanied by specificpolicy measures aimed at dealing with the &quot;notoriously weakcompetition policy&quot;, state purchasing that favoured large firms,export incentives biased against small firms and inadequatetraining for small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission warned, however, that &quot;the labour market cannot,and should not, be expected to bear the full brunt of theadjustment alone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as industries continued to benefit from subsidisedelectricity and finance, labour would continue to be a relativelycostly input, which could lead to demands for wage cuts in returnfor employing more people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission said these factors appeared to be recognised ingovernment's present approach to industrial policy, but itexpressed concern that it was not focused enough on the efficientand effective use of scarce capital resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It urged that the Industrial Development Corporation be forcedto refocus its activities. It recognised that this &quot;may be akin toturning a supertanker&quot;, but said it should focus more on jobcreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A disproportionate share of its resources is devoted to verylarge highly capital-intensive projects, generally in partnershipwith a predictable array of well-resourced corporations,&quot; thecommission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key to any attempt to move towards labour-intensive policieswould be concerted efforts to improve productivity and link thatto wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In fact, as the South African economy becomes more open tointernational competition, firms will only be able to survive iftheir costs and productivity are comparable to those of theirmajor international competitors,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission said there was no clear evidence that SouthAfrican wages were out of sync with the rest of the world, butthere was no room for complacency. Productivity had to be improvedthrough the introduction of training programmes, multi-shiftsystems and the development of new products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big business could at the same time encourage the developmentof small and medium enterprises by sub- contracting out work.Unions have been somewhat uneasy with the idea, fearing that sub-contractors might be exploited at the expense of workers, but thecommission warned against unions trying to ban sub-contracting andbusiness against promoting the proliferation of sweatshops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Government has delivered its long-awaitedeconomic strategy. Developed by an impressive team of economists,it adheres to established economic principles and promotes fiscaldiscipline. Yet markets remain unimpressed. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main reason is slow growth and inadequate employmentcreation.  Economic growth in the integrated scenario projectionremains below 4% through 1998. In the very uncertain &quot;out-years&quot;of 1999 and 2000, the model shows more impressive growth of 4,9and 6,1% respectively. Employment growth only averages 2,9%through 2000. This does not adequately address South Africa'sprincipal problem: unemployment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growth that is envisaged is driven primarily by privatesector investment and exports. Government investment actuallydrags economic growth down in 1996 and 1997 because its growth islower than the gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In the &quot;out-years&quot;, government investment rises inexplicably from 7,5% in 1999to 16,7% in 2000 to provide an average growth rate for the 1996 to2000 period of 7,1%. Perhaps Reconstruction and DevelopmentProgramme (RDP) investment will surge in 2000, but RDP spending isno engine of growth for the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Export sector growth depends to a great extent on preservingthe shift in relative prices brought about by rand depreciation.This requires a vigilant stance against inflation. Both tightmonetary policy and incomes policy can be used here. One hopesthere will be greater reliance on the latter, permitting lowerreal interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real bank rate is seen to fall by four percentage pointsbetween 1996 and 1999. But sour management-labour relations couldundermine incomes policy and lead to excessive monetary restraint.This would strangle the domestic sector in favour of exporters.Another concern is the response of exporters to wider profitmargins. Will they expand output or reap higher profits? Muchdepends on expectations of relative competitiveness. Moreefficient production is needed. Lower tariffs should help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The model shows real wages rising in spite of chronicunemployment. Yet there is talk of more flexible labour markets.Clearly, there is need for elaboration on how more flexible labourmarkets will come about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, there is much reliance on private sector investment todrive growth, with private investment growing by about 9% annuallyuntil 1999 and then jumping to even higher rates thereafter. Butthere is no consensus that private investment will grow at theselevels. Financial markets have not responded with enthusiasm tothe government's vision -- evidence that for all the rhetoricabout fiscal discipline, what investors really want is growth,earnings and high rates of return. Since the government appearsintent on waiting several more years before investing in SouthAfrica, many domestic and foreign investors may decide to do thesame.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A controversial study suggests South Africa'sunemployment rate is not the highest in the world and averages 20%against the 32% quoted by most experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Labour Organisation (ILO) study recognisesthat unemployment is a problem, but is not the Sword of Damoclesthat has sent various government departments and unions scurryingaround for solutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ILO report rejects notions that South Africa suffers from&quot;structural unemployment&quot; as hazy and elastic and slams thefigures produced by the most widely quoted October HouseholdSurvey as &quot;distorted and an exaggeration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is hesitant about giving its own estimate on unemployment,but claims &quot;one would not be far wrong in 'guesstimating' anunemployment rate of about 20%. Such a level is serious, but wellshort of the figure of 32% cited by politicians, economists andthe media.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Few politicians mention the &quot;f-word&quot; anymore --it has been replaced by the &quot;c-words&quot; which are more and morecharacterising the ANC's approach to governing South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;f-word&quot; -- federalism -- was deliberately dropped duringconstitutional debate earlier this year, so that parties couldmove away from time-worn arguments and develop a new system ofgovernment based on the golden principles of co-operation,consultation and compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Co-operative government&quot; is a term that can be sourced indebates about federalism and describes a system where provincialgovernments co-operate with one another for the common good,rather than compete against each other for individual gain. In theNew South African sense it is embodied in the new Council ofProvinces (COP), which will replace the Senate, and in theIntergovernmental Forum which is a forum for provincial andnational executives, as well as in Minmec forums, which aremeetings of national and provincial line-function ministers andMECs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is thrilled with this model, partly because it was away of side-stepping a head-on argument over federalism andcentralism -- but also because it is a pleasant and positivenotion which decreases the chances of messy conflict and stand-offs between the central and provincial governments.  Further, itcomplements the African principle of ubuntu, which describes afeeling of the worth of the community, a shared brotherhood of menand women and a sense of working for the common good. It is hopedthat the model will be implemented before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party supports the model of &quot;co-operativegovernment&quot; and the principle of provincial co-operationenthusiastically, and does not believe that the accumulation ofANC interests in the COP will drown out the opposition voice of anNP-led Western Cape or an Inkatha-led Kwazulu-Natal.  Both the ANCand the NP believe that the co- operative model is a healthy stepaway from Westminster type opposition politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha, however, is wary of the new set-up because it equatesANC co-operation with co-option. IFP hardliner Walter Felgatewastes no words: &quot;Co-operative government is a shot-gun marriagebetween the provinces and central government&quot;. That is, &quot;co-operation&quot; will allow for easier, painless majority rule, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC sources indicate that the model of co-operation was bornpartly with Inkatha-led Kwazulu-Natal in mind, in order to containthat province's waywardness and to build it into a system whichallows provincial integrity on the one hand, but curtails maverickprovincial impulses born from a desire to pursue competitivefederalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential adviser Professor Fink Haysom warns againstcompetitive federalism, saying it could lead to an enormous wasteof resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the competitive system, each province competes againstevery other province and too much political energy goes intosecuring the little good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haysom believes that competitive government could well lead tograve instability within the country and economic weaknessnationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly Haysom and the ANC have a valid point, and thepursuit of co-operation among all interest groups, large andsmall, is a welcome contrast to the previous era, where the needsof a tiny sector of the population were foisted on everybody elsewithout attempts to reach consensus. The result was thedestructive skewing of resources for which South Africans will payfor decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the ANC use of the word &quot;co-operation&quot; has anOrwellian resonance to it, especially if it is to become an end initself, or is coupled to internal political agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate around a new education system is an interestingexample. It reveals that there is an articulated desire for co-operation on a highly sensitive issue, but that the ANC-ledgovernment is determined to push through its agenda, in spite ofconsultation, while using the co-operative forums to bind criticalvoices into the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Co-operation&quot; could become, at crunch-time, a thinly veiledmajoritarianism which masquerades as the common good, but in factrepresents ANC interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fights about what is the common good are expected to escalatewhen the government implements national norms and standards inareas such as health, education and welfare. In terms of theconstitution, the central government can overrule provincialobjections when implementing national norms and standards, andeffectively can make the co-operative COP a lesser partner in itsdecisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political scientist Professor Willie Breytenbach says that thejury is still out as to whether or not the ANC is going to use&quot;co-operation&quot; to bulldoze through its political will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it is interesting that Freedom Front leader GeneralConstand Viljoen -- once the ANC's sweetheart -- is concernedabout the extent to which the ANC is prepared to listen todifferences of opinion and then ignore them, especially in thefield of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the basis of that experience, and the experience ofnegotiating for volkstaat agreements for over two years, he givesthis advice to members of the public who have to negotiate withthe ANC on matters of difference: &quot;Certainly, talk, consult withthe ANC, but be very careful because you must never underestimatethe enemy, you must never underestimate the ANC, or theintellectual part of the ANC which is the SACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You must have a clear idea of what you want to do, in linewith international law, and you must stick to your point,otherwise you are on thin ice ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Viljoen said that minority parties could be sucked into awhirlpool of &quot;co-operation&quot; in which their interests could bedrowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC intellectual and SACP member MP Pravin Gordhan hits back atthat point of view: &quot;The smaller parties' fear of co-operation isa search for leverage to defend, protect, enhance minority partyconcerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's not conflict we want, it's co-operation; it's notdebilitating disagreement we want, it's optimal consensus; it'snot unilateralism we want , it's multilateralism. We don't wantindividuals to be empowered to stand in the way of the collective,we want a collective in which the individual can find a means ofexpression.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There is a mystery over the government takeoverof the Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust (ZMMT), the nominally independentbody which is the majority shareholder in Zimpapers, the country'sonly national newspaper chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month the Mail &amp; Guardian reported on the government'smove following a brief statement by director of informationBornwell Chakaodza, carried as a front-page news item inZimpapers' flagship weekly, the Sunday Mail. Chakaodza announcedthat the trust's founding deed of 1981 had been amended in Aprilfollowing a cabinet decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After that no further explanations were given for thegovernment's abrupt reversal of a key plank in its post-independence media policy -- a change with profound implicationsfor the state's role in the determination of editorial andmanagement policy of the dominant national press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointedly, journalists and editors working for Zimpapers andZiana, the government news agency, did not pursue the subject,after having spent years proclaiming the sanctity of the ZMMT'sindependence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they had gone after the story they probably would not havegot far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Chakaodza's policy bombshell, ZMMT officials have beenquiet, deflecting requests for copies of the amendments.Chakaodza's information ministry has also been evasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Searches for the director's initial press statement, still theonly source of official comment on the matter, have come up empty-handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And still no copies of the deed changes. A check at the DeedsRegistry office in Harare last week perhaps explains why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to registry officials no changes to the original 1981ZMMT Deed have in fact been registered. Which means that theoriginal 1981 trust deed is still legally in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the deed amendments have not been registered, one wonderswhere they are, why it has taken so long to put them intooperation -- and why the Director of Information announced thatthe changes had been made on April 29?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, if there has been an error of fact by eithergovernment or the media which carried Chakaodza's announcement,why was it not later corrected by the ZMMT, government or by theZMMT's own media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six weeks after the announcement of government's clampdown onthe national press structures these questions remain unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of clarity has led to further speculation. Last year,Honour Mkushi, the liberal-minded lawyer selected by trustees in1995 as ZMMT chairman against the wishes of the informationministry, spoke of the ZMMT's new struggles to carve out anindependent path just as government was twisting the ZMMT's arm toaccept the state's control over the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trust doesn't want to operate on the basis of being tiedat the end of a string that can be pulled by the Ministry ofInformation and government,&quot; Mkushi said. &quot;If I was asked to windup the trust on political grounds, I-- and several othertrustees, I think -- would prefer to fight for survival on thegrounds of protecting the principle of the trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Dramatic new details about the mysterious deathof Emperor Haile Selassie in 1975 emerged last week during a warcrimes trial in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial, which is considering evidence of alleged atrocitiescommitted during the country's communist period from 1974 to 1991,was told that Selassie, who ruled Ethiopia for more than 50 years,was driven away from his palace on September 12, 1974, in aVolkswagen Beetle -- never to be seen in public again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first public account of the emperor's death came from twoattendants who stayed with him in custody. They were brought in tosee his body on the morning of August 26, 1975.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a smell of ether in the air,&quot; one witness said. &quot;Andhis majesty was not lying in his usual position. He only had onepillow. The shawl that he wrapped himself in when he went to sleepwas lying in another part of the room. His face was ghastly andthere was a bandage around his neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The witness described how he had been with the emperor until9pm the previous evening, when soldiers came to take him away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;His majesty came from his bed and when he saw what washappening tears came to his eyes and he cried out: 'Is it nottrue, Ethiopia, that I have strived for you?' He fell on his kneesand prayed. Later I realised that these were his last words tome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third witness described how Colonel Haile Mariam Mengistu,who had assumed leadership of Ethiopia's military council, theDergue, ordered a number of graves to be dug in the grounds of theGrand Palace -- where the military's headquarters were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emperor, he said, was buried under Mengistu's officewindow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was worried he would kill me,&quot; the gravedigger told thecourt, &quot;but he lit a cigarette for me and told me to fence thearea. I did it in 15 minutes while he watched from the window.Then he ordered me to construct a building on the site. I did itin two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty-six members of the Dergue are in the dock, with someformer leaders -- including Mengistu, who fled to Zimbabwe --being tried in their absence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Zimbabwe's national award ceremony forjournalists, an annual beanfeast which for the past six years haspresented solid trophies and real prize money for independent,unfrightened journalists, is probably no more, following thisyear's occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Journalists and Media Awards (NJAMA) is aninstitution where the praise singers of Zimbabwe's press are, forone day of the year, ignored, and reporters who write what is infront of their noses are rewarded for doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nation where the daily newspapers, radio and televisionare owned by President Robert Mugabe's government and receivetheir instructions from the seldom-swept offices of the ministryof information in central Harare, NJAMA has been an inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, a pair of journalists received due recognition asnews reporters of the year for catching most of the ruling Zanu-PFparty politburo parcelling out former white-owned farms to eachother. This year the first prize was for a series of reportsexposing ruling party officials trying to purloin the tender forthe country's first cellular telephone network.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second prize was for breaching the bounds of thepresidential bedroom and identifying Mugabe's new wife, whom hemarried clandestinely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this year's ceremony was blighted by folly from which itmay prove impossible for the organiser, the Willie MusarurwaMemorial Trust, to recover.  One after the other, sponsors on whosesupport the ceremony is dependent, have announced theirwithdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a critical misjudgment to hold the affair in the hall ofthe Zanu-PF headquarters, a vast and dingy auditorium the size ofa rugby field whose parquet flooring obviously has not tastedpolish in the decade of its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bar at the Zanu-PF headquarters was run by someone'srelative who runs a bottle store 30km outside town. It was arevealing indication of the headquarter's usual clientele. It costZim $5 deposit for a glass for each drink, and it was a nightmaretrying to get the money back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of the ceremony, Kindness Paradza, the president ofthe Zimbabwean Union of Journalists (ZUJ), was urging members ofhis union to boycott the awards because, he said, the electronicmedia, which consists entirely of the state-owned ZimbabweBroadcasting Corporation (ZBC), were not represented in theawards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZBC had let the organisers know in March that it waswithdrawing its participation because of the way its journalistshad been &quot;lampooned&quot; at the awards last year, but also because oneof the judges was Jeremy Brickhill, a private television producerwho is suing the ZBC for a large amount of money for non- paymentof fees. ZBC journalists affirm they were instructed by theirmanagement not to have anything to do with NJAMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZUJ had already expressed concern that the venue, chosenbecause the organisers got it &quot;dirt cheap&quot;, might prejudice theimpartiality of potential participants, 90% of whom comprised theZBC, Zimpapers, the national newspaper chain and the ZimbabweInter-Africa News Agency (ZIANA), the domestic news agency, all ofwhom fall under the financial and editorial direction of Zanu-PF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZUJ was a member of the organising committee which had beenmeeting twice a month since November last year, although itsrepresentative made only sporadic appearances. The first thecommittee heard of ZUJ's withdrawal was in the columns of thedaily newspapers on the day of the awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ZUJ's boycott pretty well worked. The collection of tablesin the southern section of the hall was already dwarfed by theimmensity of the auditorium, and the effect was enhanced by theoccupation of only about half of the seating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipients of awards had been advised, however, that failure toattend the ceremony would deprive them of their award and of theprize money (R1000 for first place, R500 for second and R250 forthird). The only person not to turn up for his award failed to doso because he was injured in a car crash.  It could not beestablished whether he forfeited his prize money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guest speaker for the occasion was Deon du Plessis, managingdirector of Gauteng Newspapers, whose huge bodyguard drewappreciative murmurs as he ferried many large brandies and coke tohis employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Du Plessis's speech, stating that South African newspapers have&quot;a good news obligation&quot; under the new government, went down likea stone with those in the audience who had anything to do with thelate Willie Masururwa, the patron of the trust and former editorof the Sunday Mail, Zimbabwe's biggest selling newspaper. Msururwahad repeatedly warned his staff of the dangers of &quot;sunshinejournalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The massacres of civilians in the western provinces ofMatabeleland by Mugabe's 5th Brigade, corruption, Zanu-PF'speculiar support for the PAC instead of the ANC, and its&quot;leadership code&quot; of austerity that everyone ignored were issuesthat Musarurwa could not close his eyes to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musarurwa was sacked on Mugabe's orders in 1985. Maybe, in histime, he would have survived had he listened to the likes of DuPlessis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The ailing Angolan president is turning his backon his own party, reports the latest edition of AfricaConfidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jose Eduardo dos Santos's recent sacking of PrimeMinister Marcolino Moco and his cabinet was a belated attempt torally his troops before they have to start doing business withJonas Savimbi's political cadres in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The merging of government and rebel armies is meant to befinished within three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Angolans are sceptical; Dos Santos is widely seen asheading a weak, divided and discredited party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fernando Franca Van-Dunem, whom Dos Santos has chosen torevitalise the government, does not stand out as a beacon ofreforming zeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Dos Santos himself seems seriously weak. Diplomats inLuanda have been trying to discover just what is wrong with him.Since he was treated at a private clinic in France in April, hehas rarely been seen in public and has received few visitors atthe Futungo de Belas palace. There are rumours circulating that hehas prostate cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is uncertainty everywhere, especially around the peaceprocess. The Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola(Unita) has tentatively begun to move its troops into quarters,but its commitment to peace remains highly ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the ruling Movimento Popular de Libertacao deAngola (MPLA)) is on the brink of collapse. In 1992 Dos Santoscampaigned on his own merits, aided by a slick Brazilian-runadvertising campaign, and since then put a distance betweenhimself and the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos relies heavily for advice on a small group offriends and family. The United States has invested a great deal inits relationship with the president. An important channel has beenformer assistant secretary of state Herman Cohen, whose consultingcompany has worked closely with the Dos Santos government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos has recently failed to give a consistent politicallead at home or abroad; to many he appears more interested in hisprivate affairs than in running the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats fear that Dos Santos may reject the advice of theposter at Luanda airport proclaiming &quot;Angola no coracao (Angola inthe heart)&quot; and might leave for Brazil and a wealthy retirement.Ill-health and his growing fear of plots have made the presidencytougher than ever. But senior MPLA officials work hard to keep himgoing. They fear bloodletting in the party if he quits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MPLA is regularly attacked from inside. Lucio Lara, theformer secretary general, recently called the party &quot;old andtired&quot;. It has not held a congress since 1991 and the centralcommittee decided in February to postpone the next congress to1997. The apparatchiks do not want to draw attention to thedivision, corruption and weakness of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a year after Bicesse Accords, in May 1991, the MPLA failedto meet the challenge of Unita, which lost the multi-partyelections of September 1992 mainly because of Jonas Savimbi'sthreatening campaign, rather than the MPLA's merits. The MPLA wasstimulated to pull itself together by Unita's rejection ofelectoral defeat and its return to armed struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the Lusaka Protocol in 1994, the government army,=46orcas Armadas Angolanas (FAA), clearly had the military advantageover Unita forces.  But this is not the same thing as the MPLAhaving the military advantage. FAA officers such as General Joaode Matos have shown open contempt for the party.  De Matos himselfnever joined the MPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MPLA of old started dissolving in the run-up to the 1992elections.  when many members started moving their families out ofAngola and got as much money out as they could. That process hasnever been reversed and the party has not been renewed. Now MPLAofficials seem intent on pursuing their private interests andleaving the growing urban poor in the hands of United Nationsagencies and foreign non- governmental organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State power is supposed to be concentrated and co- ordinated inthe Council of Ministers. In practice ministers look after theirown ministries and governors after their provinces. Strategicdecisions are made mainly by the president's Futungo palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Futungo overrules cabinet frequently. For example, in September1995 it stopped the issue of new banknotes by Finance MinisterAugustino Tomas. There is almost no talk of post-warreconstruction. Futungo's longest perspective is the two-monthlyrenewal of the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rulers' main energies go into their own business affairs.Minister of Agriculture Isaac dos Anjos recently got a bank loanto set up a fruit factory in which he is the shareholder-owner. Hetold the press that he had to look after his own interests first.There are more than 70 foreign security firms in Luanda,protecting senior people's interests. Meanwhile teachers are paidabout $3 per month; a bottle of beer costs $1. The foreign-exchange value of the Kwanza fell by 3,608% in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government announced in May that it is planning measures toease the crisis. After the reshuffle, it is rumoured there will bepay increases for state employees. Without sound public finances,that can only spur inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crime is pervasive. The authorities have banned severaldemonstrations, broadcasting warnings on the radio and stationingrapid-intervention police (the infamous &quot;Ninjas&quot;) to deter would-be demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government cannot really trust the active army and theregular police, some of whose senior officers sympathise with thediscontented civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government tries to hold the loyalty of senior servingofficers by allocating profitable enterprises to them. The MPLAhopes this will increase its influence, because they need partypatronage if they are to make profits.  But some officers have setup on their own accounts. In Lunda Norte, at Calonda, a diamondconcession is run by Tricorn, which is linked to Chief of StaffJoao de Matos and other officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita, too, is becoming a business alliance. Of Angola's totaloutput of diamonds, estimated by Western intelligence reports tobe worth up to $690- million, Unita mined and smuggled out $430-million in 1995. The alluvial diamonds of Lunda Norte are almostworked out. In 1996 Unita brought in equipment and skilled stafffrom South Africa to work the Cuango riverbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi and his Unita associates may even be worried by DosSantos's reported illness. They do not respect the president, butregard him as a stabilising influence. The government's seniorofficers and the MPLA's cadres envy Unita's hold on diamond-richareas. Business could bring the rivals together -- or in theunrest that would follow Dos Santos's departure, set them at eachothers' throats again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When new legislation liberalising South Africa'sabortion laws reaches Parliament, much will depend on whetherAfrican National Congress MPs vote en bloc or according to theirconsciences. While the debate has yet to rage in the ANC caucus,MPs are already under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC policy has been unequivocally in favour of women's right tosafe, legal abortions -- and usual practice is for caucus to guidevoting on related legislation. But Christian and Muslim MPs andothers who oppose abortion on moral grounds face a dilemma --spelt out in a document circulating among MPs which urges the ANCto oppose an open vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It carries the name of deputy president Thabo Mbeki's adviser,Reverend Frank Chikane, and is a position paper issued by theResearch Institute on Christianity in South Africa at theUniversity of Cape Town's Department of Religious Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Co-authored by Professor John de Gruchy and Reverend BarneyPityana, the paper, entitled The Dilemma of Some Christian MPs andthe proposed abortion policy, does not argue for or againstabortion, but for the right of MPs to dissent on party policy onreligious or moral grounds, while remaining loyal party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They argue that because MPs cannot cross the floor to anotherparty without losing their seats, coupled to the fact they are notelected by constituencies, an open vote is necessary on religiousor moral principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many members of the ANC honestly believe the pro- abortionpolicy which has been proposed is an expression of the commitmentto gender rights and equality (and) also regard it as the best wayto deal with a highly complex moral and medical issue,&quot; theywrite. &quot;But there are also those who disagree on the basis of adifferent interpretation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question of abortion is a particularly difficult one formaintaining party discipline because it is on the boundary betweenwhat the ANC might expect from its members who support its standon gender issues and yet who, on religious or moral grounds,cannot support legalised abortion or the proposed legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There can be no doubt that the rights of women cannot bedenied or voted against by ANC representatives; there can also beno doubt that Roman Catholics as well as believers of some othertraditions cannot vote for abortion without denying their faithand its moral demands. They want to support gender equality andrights, but not in this way. So in all conscience, they are dutybound to dissent. It is precisely on such boundary issues that anopen vote becomes necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allowing a free vote would be &quot;a clear sign that the ANCrecognises the higher loyalty which people of all faithsacknowledge&quot;. &quot;Instead of alienating sections of the populationwhich are generally supportive of ANC policy, they will strengthentheir commitment to the party,&quot; the paper says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MPs facing this dilemma find it compounded by the fact theirvotes become part of the public record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said a Muslim ANC MP: &quot;We have already been denounced byreligious leaders for not speaking out against abortion duringconstitutional negotiations. We are members of the ANC and thecountry is governed by a Constitution guaranteeing women'sequality, but ultimately we are bound by the Qu'ran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response, the Reproductive Rights Alliance has urged the ANCto reaffirm its position on abortion. &quot;The fact that abortion is amoral issue should not mean the ANC need feel obliged to abandonparty discipline .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As things stand, the African Christian Democratic Party isopposed to liberalising abortion laws. So is the National Party,which will use the whip to ensure its members toe the party linein voting against the new bill -- unless sufficient NP womensupporters who feel differently can make their voices heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party will allow its MPs to vote according totheir consciences. After a debate in the Inkatha Freedom Partyparliamentary caucus last year, IFP leader Mangosuthu Butheleziallowed MPs to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are different views within the IFP and they areirreconcilable,&quot; said an MP. &quot;The one is that abortion is a crime,the other that it's a crime that women can't have them. But itseems the majority of caucus is opposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The big question is which way the ANC will jump.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Draft legislation liberalising the country'sabortion law was due before a cabinet committee on May 29. Buthealth minister Nkosazana Zuma withdrew it at the last minute,fuelling suspicions that political considerations -- not the leastpending KwaZulu-Natal local government elections -- has seen itpushed to the backburner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian established this week that the draftTermination of Pregnancy Bill was submitted by the department ofhealth drafters on May 22 and scheduled to go before the CabinetCommittee on Social Affairs and Administration on May 29. Thematter was left in abeyance at the request of the minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of health legal section head Sello Ramasala saidthis week he was not aware of any problems with the bill -- rulingout the possibility of it being withdrawn for technical reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speculation is now focused on whether the political sensitivityof the legislation -- which provides for abortion on request -- isnot the issue.  There was also concern this week that the delaywould prevent the bill from being introduced to parliament beforeit rises at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuma said she did not want to discuss Cabinet issues with thepress. &quot;On principle, members of Cabinet do not go to the press onCabinet issues until approval has been reached, because it is acollective,&quot; said director general Dr Olive Shisana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I recall we in the department had not worked out thefinancial implications and had to do that on the Cabinet memo tobe sure the minister was properly advised in terms of theimplications of the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The department did not withdraw the Cabinet memo. But theroutine is that if there are financial implications it's requiredto consult the Department of State Expenditure. That could not bedone because while the provinces said they had the money, we hadto have it in writing -- we couldn't rely on verbalconsultations,&quot; said Shisana. &quot;We felt it was important to takethat step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was &quot;no way&quot; she could give dates when the Bill wouldcome before Cabinet. The ball is rolling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indications are that the African National Congress is waryabout floating the issue ahead of the KwaZulu-Natal elections forfear it will become a political football. The Inkatha FreedomParty is also divided on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would appear to me the matter is deliberately being put onthe backburner until after the KwaZulu- Natal elections,&quot; said IFPMP Suzanne Vos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also speculation that Zuma -- who strongly backsabortion reform -- may be less than keen on engaging in a heftypolitical battle so soon after the Sarafina 2 debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for health care providers the issue is critical. Hospitalsare battling to cope with the demand for legal terminations interms of the existing law and they have to plan to provide theinfrastructure and training necessary to cope with demand once thelaw is changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judicial process has also been affected: in somemagisterial districts, cases involving medical practitionerscharged with providing illegal abortions have been stayed pendingchanges in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Marj Dyer, president of the Abortion Reform Action Group,said she was receiving up to four calls a day from women &quot;acrossthe spectrum of population groups, income level and religiousaffiliation&quot; seeking terminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hospitals are not coping with the demand for legal terminationsunder the current law. The new bill, if passed, would provide forwomen to be treated at primary and secondary health-carefacilities -- taking the strain off the major hospitals and givingwomen more equal access to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Western Cape, a provincial task group has been set up todeal with problems being encountered in implementing the existinglaw. &quot;There's this sense of limbo because we don't know what'shappening with the legislation.  There is a need for government totake a lead and say these are the services we will need toprovide,&quot; said a task group source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH), one of three hospitals allowed tocarry out legal terminations, handles the majority of cases andcannot meet the demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Head of GSH's obstetrics and gynaecological departmentProfessor JB Dommisse has said in an internal Medical Associationof South Africa newsletter that the high demand was a result ofmany women thinking abortion on demand was available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Limited resources and other demands on the department forcedGSH to put in place two years ago a quota system limiting thenumber of women who can be given legal terminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this quota system is giving rise to its own problems.Gynaecological and out-patients' department staff find themselvessubjected to harassment from referring doctors and patients whentold the quota is full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women, told they can't be seen in a given week, try again andagain, creating a bottleneck which sees women presenting at moreadvanced stages of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A GSH representative said: &quot;The bottleneck phenomenon is alogical consequence of any quota system where demand exceeds theability of resources to cope.&quot; Women who could not be seen werereferred back to their doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They can go to a private hospital -- which would exclude, ongrounds of cost, the majority of women, or another state hospitallicensed to do terminations. However, the increase in demand atGSH is understood to reflect the difficulty women have in gettingterminations at the only other hospitals licensed to do them,Tygerberg and Somerset Hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, implementing the abortion law is costing thecountry millions of rands a year and effectively sentencing womenwho resort to backstreet abortionists to illness, sterility ordeath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent study, the Medical Research Council estimated that44 686 women a year, ranging in age from 14 to 49, presented tohospitals with incomplete abortions. The vast majority (84%) wereAfrican women, followed by coloured (11%), Asian (4%) and white(1%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During 1994, 2 180 legal abortions were performed - -- 61,3% onwhite women from the urban middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study found that 425 women each year could die in hospitalfrom septic abortions, that each year countrywide 6 961 women were&quot;moderately sick&quot; and 5 886 &quot;very ill&quot; after abortions usuallycarried out on the backstreets. The total costs of treatingincomplete abortion cases in one year was R18,6- million. Thisamount could fund more than 88 000 safe abortions using existingtechnology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The health costs and consequences of unsafe abortion to SouthAfrican women are a serious public health issue,&quot; said MichelleO'Sullivan of the Reproductive Rights Alliance, a network oforganisations formed to lobby for and promote comprehensivereproductive health care services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party is likely to win mostrural areas, and the African National Congress is poised to winthe powerful Durban metropolis and Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal's long-awaited local government elections next Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result will merely entrench the two parties' strongholds,keeping the province politically divided into mainly rural andurban constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both parties, however, are hoping for more. The ANC is pushingfor victory in at least one of the province's seven over-archingregional councils, and several of the main towns and citiesdotting the countryside, while the IFP wants to capture at leastone of the six sub-structures comprising the Durban metro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is pushing hardest for the urbanised Midlands RegionalCouncil, which stretches from Kranskop in the north to EastGriqualand in the south, Pietermaritzburg in the east and Impendlein the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC won roughly 49% of the region's votes in 1994. The IFPcame second with 35%. Comprising 20 municipalities, the regionforms part of the powerful Durban-Pietermaritzburg corridor --Ethecentre of commercial activity in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also comprising important rural constituencies, the battle forcontrol of this region has been the fiercest, marked notably byseveral violent confrontations, particularly in rural Donnybrook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP's push to make Ulundi the provincial capital, the ANC'suncontested victory in strife- torn Richmond, and a concentrationof ANC strongholds in many of the region's townships, have madethe IFP's fight for the region far more difficult than in the sixremaining regional councils, where it held a clear victory in1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The province's complicated rural local government formula --Eatransitional arrangement making chiefs automatic rural local&quot;councillors&quot; and reserving them 20% of seats on the second-tierregional councils --Ehowever, makes victory an uphill battle forthe ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the party has launched a legal challenge to theformula, the reservation of seats for mainly IFP-aligned chiefs --Etogether with the 10% reserved for mainly conservative whitefarmers or &quot;levy payers&quot; --Emean only 70% of regional councilseats will be elected from rural party lists and municipalcouncils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC would have to win at least 70% of elected seats to gaina simple 50% majority on a regional council. It could easily winthe majority of votes and still lose control of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the province's 61 towns and cities, the application of theKempton Park horse-trading deal known as the &quot;50-50&quot; arrangement--Ewhere small white constituencies in the town centres will electthe same number of councillors as populous black townships on thetowns' outskirts --Ewill be decisive in towns where the ANC winsthe most votes but falls short of an absolute council majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most complicated voting formula -- Eespecially forfirst-time municipal voters -- Eis that for the Durban metro. Themetro's 1,1-million voters will cast three ballots each todetermine the winner: one for a councillor in one of 164 wards,one from a party list for one of six sub-councils, and one from aseparate party list for the metropolitan council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC was the biggest party in the metro area in 1994 withapproximately 41% of the votes, followed by the National Party(31%) and the IFP (21%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A massive area comprising nearly one-third of the province'svoters, and controlling a R3,6-billion budget, the Durban metrowill be the prize of this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP is pushing hard to prevent this, relying partly on the50-50 deal which divides the wards equally between former white,Indian and coloured areas on the one hand, and traditionallyAfrican areas (townships) on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Known as &quot;A-wards&quot; and &quot;B-wards&quot; respectively, these are notstrict racial classifications but are rather based on former GroupAreas Act divisions. The IFP hopes to benefit from the inclusionof mushrooming informal settlements into some A-wards andparticipation in joint development forums with these settlements'&quot;minority&quot; neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP gained significant support from Durban's white votersin 1994 and has made a push for Indian supporters in thiselection. The party hopes its recent work will boost the 5% Indianvote it received in 1994 and deliver a victory in the largelyIndian northern substructure or &quot;suburb&quot; (comprising Tongaat andVerulam), where it is contesting 16 of the 18 wards --Ealbeit withmany of its Indian candidates declining to put the party logo nextto their name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An IFP victory in this substructure would deliver apsychological blow to the ANC --Erepresenting not only an IFPadvance into its metro stronghold, but also marginalising theANC's hard-won Hambanathi stronghold within the sub-structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hambanathi was the site of intense violence in the early 1980s,at the start of the province's civil war. Nevertheless, the ANC isexpected to emerge with the highest number of metropolitan votes,the only question being one of percentages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the party falls short of an absolute majority of seats, itmay find its power usurped by a hostile coalition. Most of the 53000 new Metro voters registered during the one-month delay theparty demanded in April are believed to be ANC supporters and theparty has worked non-stop to mobilise its constituencies since thedelay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The metro's black townships are largely ANC-aligned, althoughthey contain significant IFP strongholds. The minority A-wardswhich hold the balance of power are mainly Indian-dominated andthe ANC gained about 25% of the community's vote in 1994 --Esecondto the National Party's 60% majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the ANC's Indian support-base derives mainly from middle-class Natal Indian Congress supporters, its local governmentcandidates have campaigned vigorously in the working classneighbourhoods of Chatsworth and Pheonix, where its civicstructures -- such as the Pheonix Working Committee -- havefought long battles over local issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Competition for the metro's significant Indian and marginalcoloured votes is the most intense -- Ewith canvassers from theNP, ANC, IFP, Minority Front, Democratic Party and a host ofindependent groups practically stumbling over one another as theybeat a path to the next house.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Peace has become the buzzword on KwaZulu-Natal'scampaign trails as more than 14 political parties and a host ofindependent candidates and ratepayers' bodies mark the finalcountdown to Wednesday's polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior political leaders, national ministers and severalprovincial premiers have descended on the province in recent weekshoping to bolster their parties' showing among the province's 3,5-million registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major provincial parties ranked peace at the top of theirelection biddings, amid signs that the recent African NationalCongress-Inkatha Freedom Party peace effort has taken the steamout of the third- ranked National Party's strategy to portrayitself as the peaceful alternative to two warring African parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blue posters bearing NP leader FW de Klerk's &quot;NP for Peace&quot;message lost their impact when ANC President Nelson Mandela,Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezideclared the 13-year civil war &quot;over&quot; at weekend rallies aroundthe province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While national politicians competed broadly for the kudos ofthe recent peace pact and pumped national issues at traditionalrallies and public meetings, the diverse political styles of theparties emerged from the campaigns waged by their provincial andlocal counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the penultimate campaign weekend, the IFP airdroppedhundreds of thousands of party pamphlets over &quot;no-go&quot; areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC concentrated its energies on a revival of its once-powerful mobilisation tool: the street meeting. Addressing dozensof small neighbourhood gatherings in &quot;minority&quot; areas, partycandidates reminded voters of their recent civic campaignsuccesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP had a quiet weekend, with its campaign set for take-offonly this week, but grabbed local headlines by plastering treesalong the main highway into Indian-dominated Chatsworth with starkred posters promising to &quot;Hang the killers, hang the rapists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaigns of two of the smaller parties -- the DemocraticParty and Pan Africanist Congress -- juxtaposed their distantphilosophies in classic style: while PAC candidates armed withmegaphones drove postered bakkies around the crowded WarickTriangle African market area, a dozen DP supporters waged atelephone campaign from a small office in central Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minority Front leader Amichand Rajbansi augmented his publicmeeting campaign with a strategic poster drive: three faces of the&quot;Bengal Tiger&quot; mark the centre of one overpass on the N3 intoDurban between alternate rows of ANC and IFP posters symbolisingthe MF leader's &quot;neutral&quot; self-portrait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If posters were the sole determinant of election results, theANC and MF would have a clear lead in the powerful Durbanmetropolitan area. The poll is, however, about far more thanposters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haunted by claims of 1994 electoral fraud, suffering under adivided and lethargic provincial government, and seriouslyflirting with a full-scale ceasefire, KwaZulu-Natal's second post-apartheid poll is set to define the balance of power moreprecisely than ever before.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There are a number of things about Philip Powellthat confirm the media's representation of him as a warlordsenator. He is fond of wearing olive-green military trousers and abaseball cap with the logo of Inkatha's paramilitary protectionunits above the peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His turbo-charged bakkie echoes a scene from Somalia as itspeeds through a burnt-out part of a township in the NatalMidlands with men in the back carrying shotguns and automaticrifles. He calls David Ntombela, a dreaded Inkatha strongman, hisspiritual father. And in his book case at home in Howick, there isa book entitled How to Make War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it comes as a relief when this amiable and articulate manopens a trunk in the van -- which African National Congress peoplewill swear to you is frequently packed with M-26 hand grenades --to reveal camping equipment and boxes of canned food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These, he says, are more useful than guns when you are on anelection trail, trying to build the grassroots structures of apolitical party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Powell describes himself as an Inkatha Freedom Party populist,forced in the turbulent wars of the 1980s and early 1990s to dirtyhis hands in paramilitary work, but now dedicated to what he callsthe democratisation of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is some evidence, at least in Powell's case, to back theclaim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has attended 36 election rallies, some in the most remoteareas of the province, in the past four weeks. And he hasdelivered the same speech at most of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is based on the cliche of a cake that will be divided up innext week's local government elections. But it draws skilfully onthe culture and the material conditions of the rural people whoinhabit his power base in the Midlands of KwaZulu- Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White people have grown fat on the cake, he tells a rally tolaunch a new branch at Mahobeni village in the Vulindleladistrict, and they don't want to give it up. Coloureds and Indiansgot a few small slices in the apartheid era.  ANC people in thetownships got some of the crumbs --and they don't really want toshare them. The poor rural communities, whose mothers still cutwood in the forest and whose sisters collect water from the riverin buckets, still have nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where are the schools and the clinics and the roads that theANC has promised? Where is the electricity and the taps? ... Youmust elect people who will fight for the cake. You must electpeople who, when the fat white man doesn't want to give it up,will not lie down and say 'Ja Baas',&quot; he tells the applaudingcrowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most of all you must not elect someone who will eat the cake.You do not want to see the person you vote for next year drivingaround in a big car with a wife who washes her dishes under a tapwhile you are still walking to river to fetch water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speech is littered with irony -- and licence. It ignoresthe fact that Ntombela, chairman of this Inkatha district andprovincial parliamentarian, drove to this very meeting in a whiteMercedes, and that Mrs Ntombela washes dishes under hot runningwater while most wives in her village carry buckets on theirheads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Powell forgets to mention that it is the IFP government inthe province that is responsible for building schools and roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his imagery strikes a chord in the poorest of theprovince's poor.  His ability to tune into his constituency'sculture is demonstrated by the ripple of laughter that runsthrough the men's ranks when he ends by shouting: &quot;And most ofall, comrades, you must remember that this election is all about... the keke!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His last word is a play on Zulu slang for what can be seen asthe sweetest part of a woman's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the rally, Powell is in a more serious mood. He insiststhat to understand Inkatha and its &quot;old militarism&quot; it isnecessary to understand both the culture and the wretched materialconditions of its class base in the 1980s -- the rural peasantryand the urban impoverished urban strata who live in the province'simpoverished villages and shantytowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shacklords and warlords emerged in these areas as a reaction tothe attacks carried out in the 1980s by ANC youth on older peopleand chiefs in defiance of Zulu culture's veneration of authority-- and militaristic forms of punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chiefs and their supporters mobilised in the best way theyknew: by calling their indunas and forming amabutho to disciplinethe boys who had initiated what &quot;to the chiefs was almost a pogromagainst them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1960s and 1970s, says Powell, Inkatha was a movement ledby the &quot;amakholwa&quot;, a mission-trained Zulu elite made up ofgenteel men like Ben Ngubane, Frank Mdlalose, Oscar Dhlomo andSibusiso Bhengu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1980s, because it was the only organisation sympatheticto plight of the traditional chiefs, Inkatha's power base shifted.Warlords like Ntombela emerged as a &quot;spontaneous&quot; bulwark againstan ANC- inspired rejection of the values that Zulu elders stoodfor. The militaristic mood and tactics of the movement's new rank-and-file spread from below, rather than from the movement'sleadership, he maintains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Powell is adamant that the IFP is now moving into what he callsits third &quot;institutional phase&quot;, forgoing armed methods in favourof building an efficient electoral machinery and democratic partystructures. The party, pushed by its chief strategist Ziba Jiyane,is exhausted by war. It now wants to concentrate on mobilising itsnatural constituency, the urban and rural poor, by exploiting theANC's failure to deliver on the Reconstruction and DevelopmentProgramme. And this is best achieved, he points out, by civilmethods of organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't like to use military metaphors,&quot; says Powell (althoughthey still come naturally to him). &quot;But we see these localgovernment elections as a live firing exercise for the big one in1999.&quot; If this is true -- and the analysis is presented withsophistication and apparent sincerity -- then it can only meangood for those parts of the province reduced to near-ruin bywarlordism and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are aspects of the senator's past that make thissound rather strange. In the 1980s, Powell worked in the D Sectionof police intelligence, where he did a masters thesis on thetactics of the mass democratic movement in the Eastern Cape. Hewon't admit this, but it is likely his work fed into theclandestine project used by the police against the ANC in theregion at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is his &quot;father-son&quot; relationship with Ntombela, aman whose hands are deeply steeped in the blood of the province'sconflict. &quot;Ntombela came to see me when I was in hospital afterbeing wounded in a shoot-out in 1992,&quot; says Powell. &quot;I heard himtell my father, who was still alive at the time, in Zulu, that hewould have to share being my father. Since then he has been mydeepest source of inspiration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Father Tim Smith, a Roman Catholic priest who was houndedout of Ntombela's Elandskop stronghold, says Ntombela murdered hisown brother after an argument, in front of witnesses, on ChristmasDay 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntombela's impis, probably assisted by trainees from Inkatha'snotorious Caprivi unit, led an attack by thousands of Inkathawarriors on ANC-held sections of the Edendale valley in March1990. They killed about 50 people and caused some 14 000 to flee.The warlord's apparent immunity from prosecution at the time ledhim once to say of a witness, in front of a magistrate, &quot;What doesthat man want here? I can shoot him even here in court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eugene de Kock, the police colonel who has promised to giveevidence in a number of &quot;third force&quot; trials, says he personallydelivered truckloads of automatic rifles, ammunition and handgrenades to Powell when the Inkatha activist was in charge oftraining the IFP's self protection units (SPUs) at a camp near theUmfolozi Game Reserve in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Powell says he cannot comment on De Kock's charges because hewill possibly be involved in a criminal trial over the matter. Buthe insists the SPUs were set up to defend against attacks from theANC's self-defence units, that no weapons were issued during thetraining he supervised, and that police authorities were fullyinformed about the activities in his training camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest peace agreement between warlords on both sides, hesays, &quot;comes from the people who are directly involved in theviolence and that's why it's more important than anything else inensuring that the peace holds&quot;.  The fighters are tired offighting, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are signs that Powell is personally tired of the warlordsenator role -- or of being perceived in that way. His wife, thedaughter of parents who were classified coloured in the apartheidperiod, is pregnant with their first child. And the senator isclearly concerned, if only for their sake, that he should &quot;stayout of the clutches of the like of (Police Minister) SydneyMufamadi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I suppose I'm enough of a student of Leninism,&quot; he says inresponse to questions about his martial image, &quot;to know thatdifferent stages of struggle call for a different politicalstrategies. We have now realised it to would be futile for us tochallenge the ANC in any other way than institutionally. We havecommitted ourselves to an institutional struggle and willpersevere however hard it is for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maybe one day, while he was on the road to one of theprovince's many war zones, Philip Powell did undergo a genuineconversion. If that means there is a genuine effort to implementhis articulate notion of a new &quot;phase of institutional politics&quot;,it may just be the senator will have to keep baked beans insteadof bullets in the back of his bakkie for good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It started in February last year as SouthAfrica's first &quot;third force&quot; trial, austere in emotion andstaggering in consequence. But this week, with 16 months of legalbattle drawing to a close, Pretoria Supreme Court Judge Willem vander Merwe allowed the courtroom an occasional moment of lightrelief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gone were the charged opening scenes when an incredulous SouthAfrica followed the participants' every utterance; when Eugene deKock's former Vlakplaas subordinates packed the public gallery ina show of support; when De Kock himself may still have hopedagainst hope that there was a way out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now many of De Kock's own men have testified against theirformer commander. De Kock himelf has admitted, in another trialwhere he testified for the prosecution, that it was &quot;accurate&quot; todescribe him as &quot;South Africa's most effective assassin&quot; and thathe expected a lengthy sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Kock seemed relaxed on Wednesday as the trial resumed forfinal argument, sometimes taking notes, sometimes watchingimpassively, a pen in his mouth, as prosecutor Anton Ackermanargued. After the day's proceedings he chatted warmly with wild-bearded Dougie Holtzhausen, one of the men who had turned againsthim. Holtzhausen was the only member of the Vlakplaas gang to havefollowed the entire day's proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Judge Van der Merwe stole the show, often engaging inlengthy dialogue with Ackerman, expounding philosophically on thedifference between &quot;your truth, my truth and the truth&quot; -- andasking a member of the attorney general's office to &quot;stamp on&quot; hiscellphone when its ringing interrupted proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Ackerman referred to Holtzhausen's testimony, the judgecautioned: &quot;You must be careful that he (Holtzhausen) does notthrow stones at you from the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was on the subject of state witness Chappes Klopper --whom the defence had tried to discredit with stories ofprostitutes, drugs, gold chains and more -- that Judge Van derMerwe had the most to say. &quot;If you look at what the (other) statewitnesses said, it looks like he missed Sunday school reasonablyoften.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a judge remains a judge, and that means extraneous factorsshouldn't cloud judgment. Said Judge Van der Merwe of Klopper: &quot;Heis not the type of character that I would want to stroll with on aSunday afternoon in a park, but that doesn't mean I should rejecthis evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The marathon murder trial of Eugene de Kockentered its final stages this week with a blistering prosecutionattack on the former Vlakplaas commander's lawyers for drawing outproceedings with &quot;irrelevant&quot; cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutor Anton Ackerman, deputy Transvaal attorney general,made the charge in a lengthy submission as the 16-month-old trialresumed in the Pretoria Supreme Court on Wednesday for finalargument. De Kock's defence team has already cost taxpayers morethan R4-million, about half in fees for chief defence counsel FlipHattingh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late last month Hattingh accused Ackerman of &quot;seriousmisconduct&quot; for meeting De Kock, who is charged on 121 counts ofmurder, fraud and unlawful weapons possession, in January at thePretoria Central Prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hattingh, who said he should have been consulted about themeeting, threatened to ask for a mistrial and reported Ackerman tothe Pretoria Bar Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Ackerman at no stage said Hattingh acted outside hisrights in his style of cross-examination, he argued Hattingh hadoften dwelt, sometimes for weeks, on &quot;collateral&quot; aspects whencross-examining state witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman said Hattingh attempted &quot;from the outset&quot; to discreditstate witnesses, often on extraneous factors such as Vlakplaasinformant Ben van Zyl's &quot;extra-marital affair&quot;, or allegations ofChappies Klopper's relations with prostitutes. He said the statedid not regard Klopper -- witness &quot;Q&quot; who first told the GoldstoneCommission about Vlakplaas crimes -- as a key witness. &quot;Hundredsof pages&quot; of cross-examination had been spent on Klopper's ownbackground and on the 1985 departmental hearing of state witnessand former Vlakplaas commander Dirk Coetzee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman said it was common for witnesses to differ on minorapects, but that Hattingh had spent much time teasing out theexpected. &quot;This is exactly what happened in this case ... while itwas never stated what the accused will maintain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the defence had taken a new tack in September last year-- where previously it appeared to have believed De Kock could becleared of the charges, Hattingh then tried in cross-examinationto show that De Kock had merely followed orders from &quot;thegenerals&quot;. (Significantly, this was when De Kock's confidantWillie Nortje started his testimony against his former commander,and when police commissioner George Fivaz first said police wereconsidering withdrawing state funding of the defence.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman also accused Hattingh of &quot;a conscious attempt&quot; todiscredit Transvaal attorney general Jan D'Oliveira'sinvestigation team by saying, for example, that &quot;the defence wasbugged where it met with the accused&quot;. But after objections fromHattingh, Judge Willem van der Merwe told Ackerman he could notpursue the argument without specific reference to what Hattinghhad said in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman also outlined what he called the former securitypolice &quot;modus operandi&quot;. He said &quot;people who wanted to makerevelations over police irregularities were to be killed&quot;, andthat this was confirmed by, for example, the cassette player bombsent to Coetzee. The bomb killed lawyer Bheki Mlangeni -- hisdeath is one of the murders of which De Kock is accused.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Former senior members of the ANC Women's League(ANCWL) have raised questions about the impartiality of theauditor who compiled the report on the league's finances, as therow over financial mismanagement in the league escalated inParliament this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, such is the fear and loathing between various sectorsof the league that suspicions are not stated openly, and the auditreport has remained sizzling in the fat of secrecy all week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was revealed at the weekend that the auditors, commissionedby the ANC, had discovered &quot;serious discrepancies&quot; in the spendingof about R7,8-million by the ANCWL during a period when ANCstalwarts Adelaide Tambo and Makhosazana Njobe were treasurers,and Baleka Kgotsisile, now deputy speaker of Parliament, was itssecretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The audit, by Hardman and Associates, was commissioned by ANCsecretary general Cyril Ramaphosa after fights about power andfinances within the league last year, which have not yet beenresolved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Ramaphosa appointed the auditors, Winnie Madizikela-Mandela is said to have suggested which firm be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeff Manning, senior partner of Hardman and Associates, saidweekend media reports &quot;had got it all wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 99% of the almost 7,8-million could be accounted forand the report did not apportion blame to anyone in the ANCWL.Manning added that Tambo was &quot;not a financial whizz-kid&quot; and mostof the problems were due to a lack of proper controls and systemsand to the inexperience of junior officials, not tomisappropriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody could be accused of fraud on the basis of the report,&quot;he said.  &quot;I've recommended that Mrs Tambo and Mrs Madizikela-Mandela sit down together and go through all the transactions anddecide which ones should be accepted and which ones not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has said it would call such a meeting that wouldinclude Ramaphosa and ANC treasurer general Reverend ArnoldStofile to help to sort out the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manning said he had also discovered that last year's fall-outin the ANCWL, which led to the walk-out by nine executive membersincluding Tambo and Kgotsisile and the resurrection of Madizikela-Mandela as unchallenged president, had been over nothing at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recommendations of the auditor -- which appear to be of apolitical nature -- have not gone down well with those who walkedout last year, and who fear he wrote the audit from a particularperspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC has spent R91 000 on an assault on our integrity,&quot;growled one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unnamed former executive members say the auditor had notquestioned key role-players such as Tambo and Njobe about allegedirregularities and say they are suspicious that the audit tookmore than six months to complete at a cost of R91 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to add to the saga, the so-called Winnie camp -- currentleague executive members -- say they are equally distressed thereport was leaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They refuse to comment until the league's national executivemeets to discuss the report. These members believe this debacle is&quot;slowing their progress&quot; in the empowerment of women. Asked if theleague should perhaps disband, executive member Maureen Malumisereplied: &quot;Absolutely not, we are very strong on the ground. Theleague is bringing women together over women's issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members point out the league sets up workshops on subjects suchas reproductive rights, land rights, equality and empowerment, isdriving a programme of action inherited from the Beijing Women'sConference and has led a campaign about abused women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet women MPs from outside the league are asking under theirbreath whether the league, with its power-play and its set agenda,is serving any real purpose in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Male ANC MPs who entertain the same question say they arefrightened to raise the issue lest they get branded as sexist, sothe questions remain buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official line is defensive. ANC MP Carl Niehaus answeredquestions about the ANCWL's role by saying: &quot;It's not what they'vedone, it's what they have the potential to achieve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And league members, past and present, are wary of what they seeas male plots, speculating the audit report was leaked by male MPsto disempower women within the organisation, and to undermine theleague after its outspoken criticism of the Sarafina II affair andits support for beleaguered Deputy Enviroment Minister BantuHolomisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some see criticism of the league as a strategy to unseatMadizikela-Mandela from her last throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niehaus said the ANC is waiting for additional information onthe finances before proceeding with the meeting. This contradictsManning, who says he has closed his books on the league for good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Telkom's plans to set itself up as an Internetservice provider (ISP) have prompted the Internet ServiceProviders' Association (ISPA) to take the parastatal to theCompetitions Board. The ISPA believes Telkom is using its uniquelyprivileged position to squeeze existing ISPs out of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Telkom's monopoly on telephone lines and othercommunications infrastructure, ISPs are forced to become clientsof the South African Internet Exchange (SAIX), a division ofTelkom. In the case of the larger service providers, this costs inthe region of R1-million a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the ISPs believe Telkom is undermining them by marketingitself direct to the public and to corporate clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ISPs are legally obliged to buy all communications servicesfrom Telkom,&quot; says David Frankel, joint chair of ISPA. &quot;Thisincludes artificially expensive international circuits tocommunicate with the United States. If ISP were allowed to bypassTelkom using international carriers directly out of South Africa,our prices to end users could be reduced dramatically. Telkom isabusing its monopoly and profitability in this area to undercutexisting ISPs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As service providers have to work through Telkom whenconnecting a new client to the Internet -- a process which cantake up to eight weeks for Telkom to install a digital line --there are concerns that SAIX will be at an unfair advantage whenit comes to linking up new customers, since Telkom will be able togive first priority to SAIX clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ISPA fears that Telkom's entry into the service provisionmarket could bring an end to the healthy competition in theindustry which has so far seen a boom in Internet serviceprovision in South Africa. Frankel has received hundreds ofletters from existing or prospective clients who acknowledge thatsubscribing to SAIX will be far more competitive than remainingwith the existing ISPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with Intelligence magazine, Telkom's strategyand business development executive Blackie Lahoud claimed Telkomwas not guilty of unfair competition, but &quot;we're doing what Telcosaround the world are doing -- adding value to our services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frankel points out this is an invalid comparison, given theabsence of competition or regulation to keep a check on Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom's Internet product manager Rikus Mattyser said in aninterview with Sapa this week that SAIX is not a service provider,and that the existing ISPs are its only clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet publicity material put out by Telkom clearly expresses anintention to become a service provider dealing direct with thepublic. &quot;Will Telkom provide Internet services? YES!&quot; proclaimsone brochure. It goes on to detail the advantages of Internetaccess to the business user, and declares &quot;Telkom's SAIX servicemakes it easier than ever to access the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approached for further comment, Telkom representative ZandileMxaku said the matter was now before the Competitions Board, andthe corporation could not respond to media enquiries at thisstage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Next month, the South African Communist Partycelebrates 75 years of struggle for the socialist transformationof South Africa, as the oldest communist party on the continent.But this week, comrades were asking what had happened to thesocialist agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unease in party ranks over the direction the economy is takingwas ratcheted up by the SACP Central Committee's support for theobjective of the macro- economic framework announced by governmentlast week -- a package that also had business applauding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Comrades are uncomfortable,&quot; said a source. &quot;With thedocuments inhaled by business as it was, there must be somethingwrong for the SACP to have reacted as it did.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its statement, the Central Committee said it &quot;fully backed&quot;the objectives of the package, noting it was designed as a vehicleto achieve Reconstruction and Development Programme goals, thatthe role of the public sector would be expanded and the labourmarket would be regulated, rather than left to market forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the policy has been criticised by left-wing economists forgiving business most of the benefits and relying on the privatesector to turn them into growth, job creation and wealthredistribution. It has been compared with the normative economicmodel unveiled by the National Party in the last days of its rule-- which focused on export-led growth, fiscal conservatism andtight economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some quarters of the SACP, the framework's commitment toincreased social spending and other aspects are seen as mere sopsto the working class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP and party official Phillip Dexterdismissed suggestions the party was backing a right turn bygovernment, saying the new economic paradigm was forged duringnegotiations in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're not saying there are not weaknesses in the framework --but it's unfair to say government has adopted a Thatcheritevision,&quot; said Dexter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reliance on foreign and domestic private sector investment-- without any suggestion of how this would be levered -- was ofpersonal concern to him, Dexter said. &quot;But that's not to say thedocument failed miserably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's only rider in its response to the framework was tosay it intended &quot;taking forward discussion, elaboration anddebate&quot; on the strategy and that &quot;questions of detail andimplementation require ongoing scrutiny&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party sources said this week the SACP and its alliance partner,Cosatu, had been consulted &quot;very late&quot; over the package. Therewere suggestions political pressure had been applied and that theparty had buckled to it -- as it needed the ANC more as analliance partner than the ANC needed it. Why else, asked one,would the party be &quot;running cover&quot; for the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SACP deputy secretary general Jeremy Cronin said consultationwas late, &quot;but thorough&quot;. The government's argument that the areahad been bedevilled by speculation and so had to be kept underwraps had been appreciated, he said.  &quot;We are not just runningcover for the ANC and government. We have been calling for thepast two years for a clear macro-economic framework and forgovernment to take the lead. This has been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;crunch issue&quot; was that the framework opted for a verytight budget restructuring to reduce the deficit by 1% in oneyear, Cronin said. &quot;We're not sure this is the right route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are good arguments for reducing the deficit -- itcreates breathing space and the country won't be pushed into adebt trap -- but it's founded on the hope that business will cometo the ball. Our concern and scepticism centre on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clear framework meant that within a year or two there couldbe an assessment of what should have happened but hadn't. Cronindenied any political pressure had been applied on the party totemper its response.  &quot;There were honest discussions within thealliance about the framework and the reasons for it. Wisdominformed us that a certain degree of support is important. Therewere no pressures on us, and they would not work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there had been a call &quot;for a level-headed appreciationfor what government is trying to do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He conceded the left's failure to come up with an alternativemodel -- Cosatu's social equity document does not address macro-economic policy -- reflected weaknesses, such as a lack oftechnical capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unease in party ranks was more a problem for the ANC-ledgovernment. &quot;The critical thing is to open the debate and discusshard choices and prevent the tendency of bureaucrats to do thingsquietly in the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A meeting of the Central Committee in two weeks' time could seesparks.  &quot;Labour and the broad left within the party are going tobe very critical,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But a key question is whether we as a working class movementhave been able to create pressure for these issues to be engagedfrom a working class point of view. We must all takeresponsibility for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Oppenheimer heirs -- Anglo American deputychairman Nicky Oppenheimer and Mary Slack -- met President NelsonMandela at his Houghton home last week to discuss the possibletakeover by the National Empowerment Consortium of AngloAmerican's press interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the meeting hadbroached a range of issues, but he refused to confirm or denywhether the matter of the press interests had been raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian understands that Oppenhemier and Slackvoiced concern about the possible control of the publicationsowned by Times Media Limited (TML), which publishes Business Day,Sunday Times and Financial Mail. TML is part of the Johnnic group,the collection of Anglo American assets earmarked for sale in amajor black empowerment deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possible exercise of editorial control by the NationalEmpowerment Consortium, the group of companies bidding forJohnnic, prompted senior TML officials to draw up an editorialcharter, effectively enshrining the publications' editorialindependence and preserving the publications' Anglo traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that the consortium, which includes New AfricaInvestments Limited (Nail), has scoffed at the idea of such acharter.  Ironically, TML first encountered the idea of aneditorial charter when it was eyeing New Nation, the weeklynewspaper now owned by Nail. TML frowned at New Nation'ssuggestion of a charter, saying editorial control would have torest with it. Nail also owns the Sowetan and is bidding for one ofthe SABC radio stations up for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The M&amp;G understands the meeting between Mandela and theOppenheimers was intended to focus on the continued independenceof the press if and when it comes under black control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, and it has not been lost on the ANC, it was Slack'sformer husband, Gordon Waddell, in his executive position atAnglo, who was primarily responsible for closing a former TMLpublication, and its flagship the Rand Daily Mail. Senior ANCmembers are riled that Anglo is suddenly worried about pressindependence on the eve of possible black ownership of itspublications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - One of South Africa's most trumpeted blackempowerment deals to date is floundering badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the negotiating team thrashing out theNational Empowerment Consortium's bid for a collection of stakesin Anglo American companies say that, after a heavy round of talkson Youth Day, the deal seems to be in peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consortium bidding for the Anglo companies includes NewAfrica Investments Limited (Nail), and its negotiating team isheaded by outgoing African National Congress secretary generalCyril Ramaphosa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stakes in the companies in its sights were hived off byAnglo into a holding company called Johnnic -- in preparation,Anglo said, for a sale which promoted black economic empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Anglo is angling for a price far beyond the reach of theblack businessmen it seeks to empower. &quot;Anglo American is pushingthe price to a point where it could mean this is not the rightdeal for the National Empowerment Consortium,&quot; an analyst close tothe negotiators said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some players in the negotiations say it appears Anglo Americanis backtracking on the deal. Although it set up Johnnic with theexpress intention of selling it on to promote black economicempowerment, it has shied away from the idea of selling the parcelof assets off at any discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nail chairman Nthato Motlana expressed concern about the pricelast year, but since then it had appeared Anglo was willing tonegotiate downwards. &quot;At first they were in a hurry to push thedeal through. Now it looks as if they are having second thoughts,&quot;a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A financial analyst at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange said itappeared Anglo had originally trumpeted the Johnnic deal in a bidto &quot;get the heat off them on black economic empowerment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now it appeared Anglo was willing to ditch the deal if it didnot get the market price for Johnnic. It would then split upJohnnic, and the various players in the National EmpowermentConsortium could pick up the pieces separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many commentators believe this might not be such a bad thing.=46or although the Johnnic deal has been touted as a pivotal steptowards black economic empowerment by both Nail and AngloAmerican, many analysts and union advisers are unimpressed withthe mixed bag of assets on offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assets include substantial stakes in Anglo American'slisted press companies, Times Media and Omni Media, as well assmaller stakes in South African Breweries, Toyota and Premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main criticism is that, apart from the press companies,Nail will not have anything approaching control of the others inthe portfolio, which is a tiny mirror image of Anglo American -- asprawling conglomerate which has invested in many unrelatedcompanies in all sectors of the economy because exchange controlsbarred it from investing abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The main motivation for the deal is to get some senior blackfaces in South African business quickly. But there is not going tobe much empowerment from it (the deal),&quot; said the JSE analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that if Anglo American were unable to sell offJohnnic as a whole, halted the talks with the consortium and splitup Johnnic, it would allow Nail to snap up Johnnic's press assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would make strategic sense, given that Nail owns theSowetan and New Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other members of the consortium are also known to have theireye</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on particular parts of the Johnnic portfolio. Wiseman Nkuhlu'sWorldwide Africa Investments, which is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also in the consortium, is apparently keen on buying thePremier stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore understandable that a source close to the Nailnegotiating team said: &quot;It is not the end of the world if we don'tget Johnnic. We have lots more up our sleeve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American refused to comment on the Johnnic talks thisweek.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The final two pieces to the Olympic jigsawpuzzle which has been forming since February fell in to place onTuesday when pole vaulter Riaan Botha and modern pentathlete ClaudCloete were named to the team which leaves for Atlanta a week onSunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was surprise in some quarters that the National OlympicCommittee of South Africa (Nocsa) failed to select a secondathletics candidate. Nocsa left open two more places for thissport when the original athletics squad of 23 was announced at theend of April. The truth is, however, that none of the other fournominations on Athletics South Africa's (ASA) list met thestringent selection criteria laid down by the national Olympicbody.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Athletics simply found out what several other sports had learntearlier in the year: meeting the required qualification standardsis not necessarily good enough to book a passage to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha, who was inexplicably left out of the first athleticscontingent, having already cleared the qualifying standard fourtimes during the South African season, gave the selectors nooption but to include him on the team when he cleared a personalbest 5.85m in Lyon last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cloete failed to qualify at two Olympic qualificationcompetitions in Seoul and Rome earlier in the year but his badluck in drawing a belligerent horse for the equestrian round wherehe failed to score any points almost certainly cost him a worldclass score in Seoul. That convinced Nocsa that Cloete was worth awild card nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wild cards are awarded to athletes from developing countrieswho have not qualified in a sport through the normal channels. TheIOC duly obliged at the weekend and Cloete has become the onlyAfrican representative in the modern pentathlon in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically Botha's name was not at the top of ASA's list ofnominations despite the fact that his 5.85m clearance last weekplaces him eighth in the world at the moment and makes him agenuine medal prospect at the Games. Top spot belonged to racewalker Chris Britz who was controversially nominated to theoriginal squad on a &quot;B&quot; standard qualifier, the only athlete to beconsidered on such a standard despite the omission of many &quot;A&quot;standard qualifiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britz was subsequently rejected by Nocsa but a lifeline wasthrown to him and other athletes who were surprisingly omittedlike Botha, javelin thrower Philip Spies, high jumper HestrieStorbeck and hurdler Ferrins Pieterse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa said they would leave two places open until June 18, bywhich time candidates should have registered an &quot;A&quot; qualifier anddemonstrated their fitness, among other conditions. Britz went toGermany and recorded an &quot;A&quot; qualifying time, shattering his ownnational 20km record by more than two minutes to record 1:22:16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Impressive as this time may be in one of South Africanathletics' Cinderella disciplines it is unlikely that it placeshim in the current world top 50. The world ranking lists of June11 are only 30 deep but those of May 27 which are 50 deep show himin a lowly 48th position. While not wanting to detract fromBritz's performance, it is important to put it in perspectiveafter such ludicrous claims have been made on his behalf by ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stating that such a performance would have won the 1993 worldchampionships, placed him second at the Barcelona Games and sixthat last year's world championships is a bit like comparing adownhill marathon course with a tailwind like Boston to the toughand humid Honolulu Marathon. Britz's time was recorded at theEuropean Race Walking Grand Prix in Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany,which, along with Fana in Norway for track walking, is renowned asone of the fastest road circuits around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quite how this performance ranks above Botha's completelydefies logic as does the absence of Spies' name from the list. Hethrew twice over the qualifying distance this year despitethrowing at a stage of his training when he would not normally bethrowing. His best of 81.34m ranks him 17th in the world on lastweek's world rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spies, however, had already resigned himself to the fact thathe wouldn't be on the list after challenging ASA over their aboutturn on his positive doping result last year. While suchconspiracy theories can often be taken with a pinch of salt it hasnot gone unnoticed that Britz is a loyal apparatchik of theTransvaal Amateur Athletic Congress and boasts the likes of ASApresident Leonard Chuene and ASA secretary general Banele Sindani,the two most powerful figures in the sport, as his closecolleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is admirable to promote a discipline like race walking butwhen Olympic places are at stake simple criteria like merit musttake precedence.  In athletics such attributes are relativelysimple to measure and compare provided, of course, that you have abasic understanding of the sport.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - If Preparation is one of the major keys tosuccess -- whether in sport or in battle -- then the South Africanmen's hockey team are on a hiding to nothing for the upcomingOlympic Games in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only have the squad been forced to condense their build-upto the Games because of the late &quot;green light&quot; giving them the go-ahead to compete, but their recent competitive track record ishardly the stuff of inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their last 10 internationals have not produced a single win andtheir lost/drawn ratio stands at 9/1. And they have hardly beenhelped along the way with injuries to key players Wayne Graham(captain and centre half), Alistair Fredericks (centre forward andleading goal-scorer) and Brian Myburgh (rated as one of the topgoal-keepers in world hockey).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In mitigation, though, the opposition during this 10-matchcycle has hardly been weak. Down Under in Cairns and Brisbane forthe recent four-nation tournament, South Africa faced the strengthand class of Australia (who are generally considered gold medalfavourites for Atlanta), India (currently ranked five in theworld) and a New Zealand side more or less on a par with the SouthAfricans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's report card there read: played seven, lost six,drawn one -- with the draw a 2-2 scoreline against New Zealand andone of the losses being a 2-2 result after fulltime against thesame side in a positional play-off, only for South Africa to godown on penalty flicks 5-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back at home, the South Africans took on a fit Spanish side,who were missing only two of their first-choice players, in athree-match series in Pietermaritzburg. Both teams used theinternationals as part of their final preparation for Atlanta but,once again from a South African point of view, the resultstatistics were not exactly worth framing and hanging up in a Hallof Hockey Fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite playing some very good hockey in parts, the SouthAfricans appeared fatigued at times and made too many unforcederrors. They lost the three matches 4-1, 2-1 and 6-2. Nationalhockey coach Gavin Featherstone believes one of the major lessonslearnt from this series is that South Africa desperately needs anupgraded domestic league. &quot;We don't have a club system in thiscountry to give our guys constant pressure week in, week out,&quot;=46eatherstone says, &quot;and hopefully one of the lessons of 1996 willbe that this country urgently needs a national league.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to pool all our top players to play against each otherregularly -- and not just once a year at the inter-provincialtournament. Our players aren't used to playing regular competitivehockey at the level they do in Europe, or at the level they do inAustralasia or in Asia. Only when our top players get this type ofcompetitive level will they develop the discipline to avoid what Iterm the 'lull periods' in team sport. Then they won't go throughthese lapses and lulls where they get punished at internationallevel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While obviously disappointed at the 3-0 whitewash at the handsof the Spanish, Featherstone takes the pragmatic viewpoint: &quot;Afterlosing the third Test to them, we had played 10 internationals in17 days and I think it was a case of a bridge too far. We didn'tplay the Spanish on an equal playing field; we went round theworld, played seven matches and then said, within two days, thatwe could take them on in three Test matches. It proved a littlebit too much for our lads at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But anyone who saw the quality of our play in the first halfof that third Test can see the standard we play at. Occasionallyit does happen that the bottom falls out -- but I think we musttake heart at our result in the second test ... where we lost 2-1... and at the first half of that third Test. We showed that wecan play at this level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the main thing the boys are learning is that you canhave a lot of the game and yet still lose by three goals becauseyou have to concentrate extra hard on teams who counter-attackwell. There's no doubt in my mind that that is the area I've gotto work on very hard with the players mentally between now andAtlanta.&quot; What also has not helped the South African cause was the latego-ahead given for their Olympic Games participation -- and thishas directly led to the condensed period of preparation by thehockey squad since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Remember we were allowed to go to Atlanta in mid- February,although we qualified in September at the All-Africa Games,&quot;=46eatherstone says. &quot;So we had a five-month period where we didvery little and weren't allowed to really. What we've had to do iscondense our physical training. So far, we've done endurancetraining and only now can we get on to our speed and sharpness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Featherstone feels the difference in fitness levels betweenSouth Africa and Spain during their recent series was marked:&quot;There's no doubt that the Spanish showed that they are matchsharp now for the Olympics, whereas we've still got a month to goon that training. And, in fact, our training will actuallycontinue in Atlanta because we had such a late start in goingthere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late start or not, there is very little else that the SouthAfricans could have done in recent months to improve on theirOlympic Games preparation. As Featherstone points out, a briefbreak is vital to rest bruised and overworked bodies after theintensity of playing 10 hockey internationals in under threeweeks. And an extra bonus from this short lay-off period would bethe full return to match fitness of playmakers Wayne Graham andAlistair Fredericks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite all this, it may be that South Africa will still be ona hiding to nothing come Atlanta. But the South African hockeyteam are probably owed one or two favours by Dame Fortune -- andthey could certainly do with that modicum of luck which has notsmiled upon them over the last month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - According to Tusk's Benjy Mudie, there's a&quot;renaissance&quot; happening, something of a &quot;new wave&quot;. He may beright -- either that, or local record execs are just catching upwith their counterparts overseas. At last, the garage band iscommercial again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given an injection of new life by neo-punk, grunge and alterna-rockers like REM, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Green Day, the genre ofwhite-boy-plays-loud-guitar is flowering globally. Oasis and theirlike have topped the British charts, where once only synth-swathed ditties ruled. The constraints of the mainstream money-makers, obsessed with the lowest common denominator and terrifiedof anything not produced to death, seem to have loosened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And South Africa is surfing that wave too. It may be somethingto do with our national sense of new freedoms, or perhaps it'sjust preparation for the quota system, but it does feel as thoughan awful lot of &quot;local product&quot; has been released in the last fewmonths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Highlights include albums by The Pressure Cookies (okay, mostof them are female) and The K=EArels. New work from well-knownfigures such as Tony Cox and Valiant Swart (his first CD, DieMystic Boer) is on the shelves. Bright Blue are back with a three-track EP, Open Your Eyes, and The Usual -- who share Bright Blue'sguitarist-singer Tom Fox -- have a six-track mini-album, Six Songsfrom the Inside, out too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, two new compilation CDs give a reasonably rosypicture of exactly where South African rock'n'roll stands atpresent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Street Level: Bare Essentials is the product of Cape Town'sStreet Level Studio, started by Richard Black and James Stewart.They have recorded The Usual as well as a handful of other CapeTown bands, giving them each a track or two on Bare Essentials toshow what they can do. The featured bands include Psycho- Deli,Black Diamond, The Groove Kings and Woodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that the CD has been released by record giant BMG --who also put their imprimatur on The Usuals' package -- gives hopethat the era of bands languishing in semi-obscurity without big-label support is over. The new lot, with luck, will have careerslonger than those of many of their Eighties' predecessors, forwhom the release of a record was very often swansong instead ofstarting- point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other compilation CD, the Tusk/5FM My Generation, is not --as the title, stolen from The Who circa 1965, might imply -- arepository of retro-rock. The only song on it that seems reallyout of place in 1996 is Duc the Fox's Love or Money. Otherwise,this is pretty much up-to-the-minute, a cross-section of SouthAfrica's newest, freshest talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of its 17 tracks, notably, came via the Shifty/Tic TicBang nexus, and it is a well-shaped collection that ranges fromthe guitar-lashed constructions of Squeal, Springbok Nude Girls,Sugardrive and Lithium, to the effervescently jivey pop of UrbanCreep and the New-Age yodelling of QCumba Zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of the bands featured on My Generation are touring thecountry on the Bandslam bill, which hopes to do for us whatLollapalooza did for the USA.  Perhaps it will be a further step inthe direction of white South African musicians, at last, making aliving from original music. At the very least, the concerts shouldhelp sell some CDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, beyond all this big-hype activity, the newreleases keep coming. The aforementioned Valiant Swart CD isenjoyably barbed blues-rock; KwaZulu-Natalian Syd Kitchenimpresses with his jazzified City Child; and Joe Silva takes anunusual tack with Journeys into Coincidence, a selection of laid-back numbers, a bit like Ry Cooder in lazy- soundtrack mode, whichcan only help one feel meditative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then there's Jonathan Handley. The King Rat, pretending tobe The Glee Club, continues his South African Gothic saga withpart two, Transvaal Gothic (the first was Free State Gothic). Thewhole is a massive cycle of 33 songs, revolving around thepicaresque story of a sometime windmill salesman.  Maybe onedoesn't need all 33 songs to get the picture, but none are merethrowaways, and many are as good as anything of that ilk ever madein this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Handley is still, scandalously, on cassette only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - In a report dated 22 April, the &quot;Gazette&quot; has receivedaccounts of surprise attacks by a joint force of the Misiriya Arab&quot;murahaleen&quot; and the Popular Defence Forces (PDF) of the Khartoumregime upon the Dinka communities in the Abyei and NorthernGogrial areas.  These areas had been peaceful since 1991 owing toa peace accord signed by the Misiriya Arabs with the Ngok and TwicDinka.  It now transpires that the National Islamic Front(NIF)regime offered the Misiriya Arabs all manner of inducements tobreak that peace accord and finally, in February, it succeeded inthat objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The joint force launched its attack on 29 February along theRiver Kiir.  The operation lasted until 3 March, by which timeseveral Dinka villages had been ransacked and burnt down. Theyare: Malwal, Rumbek, Nguet, Micar, Atong, Majok Alieu and Lang.Cattle was looted and crops were destroyed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This past year had seen a bountiful harvest and the Dinka wereconfident that they would not need any additional relief aid. Itis believed that the Dinka's move towards self sufficiencyprovoked Khartoum into attacking at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 10 March, a further military force launched a second attackon other villages in the area, destroying Malual Alieu, Dier,Gongmabil, Rumnyien, Kokwei, Mabil Anyiuel and Kol Kuot. Thisforce was reinforced by units of the regular army stationed atAbyei. On 29 March, the attackers returned to the area in evengreater numbers. The attack was co-ordinated with the Nuer tribalmilitia from Bentiu. That militia had instructions to prevent anyDinka cattle from using the common grazing land, so that no Dinkacattle or property escaped the looters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudan People's Liberation Army's (SPLA) civiliancommissioner for Abyei, James Ajing Path, has produced a detailedreport of the attacks. In the attack of 29 March, more than fortycivilians were killed, thirty of them named in the report; morethan one hundred women and children were captured and sold intoslavery, including twenty-nine identified by the name in thereport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slave Market. A slave trading and exchange camp was set upoutside Abyei.  Women were offered for their sexual services and asdomestic slaves to Arabs who had not been involved in the attacks.The Dinka themselves were allowed to buy back their relatives atthe rate of five cows per person or the equivalent in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the third attack, large numbers of Dinka movedfurther South into Bahr El Ghazal and have sought refuge aroundthe relief centre at Mayen Abun in the Twic Dinka area of NorthernGogrial. They are now at the mercy of the providers of relief aid.The areas is part of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) but because itis in territory disputed by the SPLA and the NIF regime, therelief flights are infrequent and often cancelled at a whim by theregime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all the Dinka made homeless by the attacks have managed toreach Mayen Abun. Reports suggest that many thousands are hidingout along the River Kiir, afraid that the marauders will return tocapture them or finish them off. Those that have arrived arealready suffering from food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr James Ajing Path has appealed to the international reliefcommunity to quickly come to the aid of this newly displacedpopulation. The displaced people are quite capable of organisingthemselves to plant crops in the area during the rainy season, ifthey are given the seeds and tools with which to do it. Theplanting season in this area is quite flexible and crops could besworn as late as June and July. Obviously, the people will needrelief supplies to last until the crops can be harvested. Thesepeople are keen to become self sufficient once more, having losteverything in the three raids.  As many as 100,000 people have beendisplaced by the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workable Airstrips. There are a number of workable airstrips inthe area that could be used for bringing in emergency reliefsupplies. Apart from Mayen Abun itself, there is the airstrip atAkak to the West, and airstrips at Turalei and Maper to the East.OLS has used all four airstrips in the past.  There are a furthertwo airstrips to the North of Mayen Abun at Ajak Kwac and Agok.These last two airstrips are closest to the area of devastationand lie in a very fertile agricultural area which could be usedfor planting crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demand for Self Defence. There are many loud voices now withinthe Dinka communities, particularly in Northern Bahr El Ghazal butalso elsewhere, who are calling for the SPLA to help the tribe setup and arm home guards to defend themselves against the Arabs andother tribal militias that seem to attack them with impunity. TheSPLA has rightly resisted these calls. However, in the absence ofany other alternative for the security of this tribe- so targetedfor genocide by the NIF regime- the case for the tribe to armitself to resist the regime's machinations is quite strong. Thatis, unless the SPLA finds itself with the resources and facilitiesto station a protective force in the border areas of Northern BahrEl Ghazal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When in 1987-88 the government in Khartoum unleashed Arab andother tribal militias against the Dinka communities in the borderareas, there was also a call to the SPLA to train and arm homeguards. The reasons for resisting these calls for arms to thetribes were valid at that time and they remain so today. Perhapsthe SPLA should consider placing its guerrilla units in theseborder areas to give the tribes there the confidence they need fortheir security and protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where Is the SPLA? Whilst all the devastation and destructiontook place, the forces of the SPLA were nowhere to be seen. Thisraises the obvious question as to why this was the case. Perhapsthe SPLA believed that the peace accord between the Arabs and theDinka was the best guarantor of security in the area. Even if thatwas not the case, the SPLA would need a huge military force toprotect the area from the hit and run raids of the militia forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIF regime's plan is a simple one. If it can keep thetribes in the border areas fighting one another, then it canredirect its own war resources away from this area to other battlefronts in the South, the Nuba Mountains and now Eastern Sudan. Itis not clear what SPLA forces may have been in the area becausethere was also the problem further South inside Bahr El Ghazal ofthe militia force of the renegade commander Kerubino Kuanyin Bolat Gogrial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA has in the past been reluctant to engage in wholesaleattacks on tribal militias, as it is a force fighting for nationalliberation from the NIF regime. However, the SPLA cannot ignorethe security of the local population in these areas forever,because it ultimately needs their support.  These communities arebeing attacked because they are perceived by the NIF to besupporters of the SPLA. They would not be under such severepressure if they accepted Khartoum's overlordship. It must behoped that the SPLA will recognise that these communities do needproper protection before the regime succeeds in convincing thepeople that the SPLA has abandoned them. The SPLA will not be ableto maintain the loyalty of these groups unless it does somethingto alleviate their suffering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria - Obviously nauseated by his memories of SouthAfrica's Robben Island, a visiting Namibian Minister has requestedthe South African government to turn its notorious jail house intoa museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Andimba Toivo Ya Toivo, Namibia's Minister for Mines, whohad accompanied President Sam Nujoma to the prison on May 15, andwho spent 16 years on the prison for opposing Pretoria's rule,said such a move would help future generations learn about thehistorical importance of the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young people, he emphasised, should be able to see and knowwhere their leaders came from.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robben Island is situated 12 kilometres offshore Cape Town.Current South African President, Nelson Mandela, among others,spent 18 of his 27 years in jail on the island. The future of theprison, which is now said to hold 133 common law prisoners, is asubject of heated debate in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Toivo Ya Toivo, who is also a senior member Namibia's rulingSouth- West African People's Organization (SWAPO) further said hisreturn to the island brought back mixed feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Namibian minister recalled one incident whereby he wasassaulted by prison guards until he collapsed. &quot;If you reported acase of assault, they would turn against you and say you arespreading malicious rumours,&quot; he recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite bad memories of the prison, Mr. Toivo Ya Toivoconceded that the place had its good moments. Said he: &quot;It bringsback memories and mixed feelings, some good and some bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to some press reports, the South African governmentappointed a cabinet committee late last year to look into ways ofturning the island into a profitable possession when it ceases torun as a prison at the end of this y</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official document quoting the country's Arts, Culture,Science and Technology Minister Ben Ngubane says; &quot;Robben Islandhas been declared a national monument. This will involve theentire island, together with a stretch of one sea mile surroundingit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same document describes Robben Island as a former leper andlunatic colony, and the prison where Nelson Mandela was locked upfor 18 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bangui - A government of national unity was formed on June 18in the Central African Republic, a month after the nation wasparalysed by a mutiny but without the main opposition parties,which refused to join.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 21-member government, formed overnight on June 17 to June18 by Jean Paul Ngoupande, will have none of the main parties inthe seven-party Democratic Council of Opposition Parties (CODEPO)in its ranks, which maintained that the division of ministries inthe new government was not representative, and announced that theywould hold a press conference later on June 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngoupande said in a radio address that he regretted the absenceof the opposition within his government but added that his &quot;doorremained open&quot; to change and that he would continue cooperatingwith the CODEPO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four of the ministers belong to the Central African DemocraticRally (RDC), which was also in opposition but was not a member ofCODEPO, while the remainder are from the ruling party and civiliansociety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngoupande was called to form a government of national unityafter a bloody 10-day mutiny by hundreds of soldiers late lastmonth when more than 40 people were killed and widespread damagewas caused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Ange-Felix Patasse's ruling Movement for theLiberation of the Central African People (MLPC) wanted to holdmost posts, but CODEPO said the government should fully reflectall political forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presidential majority has 10 seats, six for the MLPC andfour for its allies, while the RDC has four, civilianrepresentatives another four and independents have two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 21st member of the government is Ngoupande himself, up tonow ambassador to Paris, who is counted as a representative ofcivilian society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngoupande and the government will have their work cut outtrying to restore economic progress blighted by the mutiny and theexodus of up to 2,000 foreign nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first tasks will be to give state employees twomonths back pay to offset wage arrears, which sometimes reach backmore than a year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAIRO - The Roman Catholic Church and Egypt's highest Muslimauthority have decided to set up a joint committee to stimulatedialogue between the two religions with a view to promotingtolerance and fighting religious extremism, it was learnt here onJune 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An announcement by Al Azhar spokesman Omar Bastawissi said theVatican and Al Azhar, Egypt's highest Sunni Muslim authority,would set up the joint committee soon to stimulate dialoguebetween the two religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The creation of this committee is aimed at bringing Islam andChristianity closer together as well as coordinating efforts by AlAzhar and the Vatican to promote tolerance and to fight againstany kind of (religious) extremism,&quot; said Bastawissi, who heads theoffice of Al Azhar Sheikh, Mohammad Sayed Tantawi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The committee will also be tasked with protecting the sublimeprecepts of Islam and Christianity and the dignity of God'smessengers,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bastawissi said &quot;a meeting between the two parties will be heldin the near future to organise the setting up of this committee,which will be made up of Al Azhar and Vatican officials as well asthe president of the International Union for Dialogue between theThree Monotheist Religions, Ali al-Saman.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that the creation of the committee was approved at ameeting in Cairo at the beginning of the month between Tantawi andCardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican's committeeaimed at forging dialogue between different religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The development is the more significant because it comes at atime when conservative religious scholars who once held sway atAl-Azhar, the citadel of Sunni Muslim orthodoxy, were now battlingto keep their influence under the new, more moderate head sheikh,Tantawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Tantawi took the helm of the 1,000-year-old institutionin March, conservatives have opened fire on his rulings, led bythe Azhar Scholars' Front (ASF) grouping around 1,000 theologians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ASF has even cast doubt on Tantawi's religious credentials,targeting in particular his refusal to declare militants who carryout anti-Israel suicide bombings as being &quot;martyrs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Front insisted Tantawi's statements on the bombers were&quot;his personal opinion which cannot be considered a fatwa,&quot; orofficial religious decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tantawi, who was the mufti of Egypt before becoming sheikh ofAl- Azhar, often differed with his more hardline predecessor Gadal-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq over issues such as bank interest andcircumcision of girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even while battling Tantawi, conservatives are also beinghemmed in by government moves to crack down on radical clericsbacking Muslim militants in their anti-state campaign which hasclaimed more than 1,000 lives since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They especially protest a draft law from the Religious AffairsMinistry allowing only ministry-appointed imams to preach and anew rule requiring ministry permission to build new privatemosques, and have warned that the law could cause &quot;unrest whichwould go beyond any unrest in the past,&quot; referring to themilitants' armed campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Religious Affairs Ministry runs 34,000 mosques and plans totake over another 20,000 private ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conservative movement sees itself threatened by Tantawi'sattempts to use the mobilization against Islamic radicals to bringthe moderate trend into dominance,&quot; and the Sheikh's latest moveon relations with the Vatican could unleash another round ofcriticisms from the conservatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A campaign launched by Channel Africa's staff to save theservice has received wide support from some internationalorganisations and some of its 15 million listeners in Africa andelsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its supporters say that Channel Africa has transformed itselfto become the voice of democratic South Africa and a credible andunbiased source of news and information in a continent where suchfree speech is limited.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Kenyans on June 18 joined other nations marking &quot;TheDay of the African Child&quot; which also coincided with the UnitedNations Children's Fund (UNICEF) 50th anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to a gathering at the City Stadium here, the UNICEFKenya country representative Mr. Chrispin Wilson noted that evenat such a time of optimism during the celebration of life andwell-being of the children present, there was need to think aboutthose children categorized as being &quot;in extremely difficultcircumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are many instances when children in our country areunable to rejoice, to benefit from their educationalopportunities, to play in a carefree way and to live outuntroubled lives within a secure family context,&quot; Wilson toldguests marking the Africanc Child Day, an occasion that waspreceded by a week of related activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) orphaned childrenwho are stigmatized and denied a nurturing family environment, thedisabled and abandoned as well as those from poverty situationshaving to work from an early age and live in inadequate,overcrowded and unsanitary housing, are some of the childrenliving in difficult circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNICEF programmes, he added, were focusing on vulnerable groupssuch as the urban poor and nomadic groups and also trying toreduce geographic and gender disparities in Kenya. Girls educationis now acknowledged as one of the most powerful instruments ofprogress, the Kenya country representative observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day's theme, Children First, emphasized the fact that theessential needs of children should be given priority in both badand good times. Some 12,000 children turned up for thecelebration, the largest number since its inception in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day's events were marked by presentations of songs, dances,plays and poems from school children, children's homes such asthose for street and displaced children, and approved schools aswell as from adult drama groups on AIDS awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Children's presentations which greatly moved the audiencehighlighted the plight of street children and the young ones' needfor parental love even amidst plenty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the week's activities street children received freescreening and educational awareness on sexually transmitteddiseases, drug abuse, hygiene and nutrition, courtesy of Kenya'sMaendeleo Ya Wanawake Organization (MYWO) the national women'sumbrella body advocating for the progress of women all over thecountry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MYWO chairlady Mrs Zipporah Kittony revealed that over 90per cent of African children live in abject poverty with more than60 per cent of births taking place in unhygienic conditionsleading to high infant mortality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Day of The African Child, set up by the Organization ofAfrican Unity (OAU) with support from UNICEF,commemorates the 1976massacre of South Africa's Sowetan children who were protesting aruling by the then apartheid government that they be taught inAfrikaans, regarded by the blacks as the language of oppression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to UNICEF, the day while marking the past, alsofocuses on the future as it gives governments, organizations, thegeneral public and children an opportunity to assess Africa'sachievements as well as its children's continuing needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 50 year-old UN Children's Fund, working mainly to nurturelong- term development, has had to rechannel an increased amountof its resources for emergency care of children suffering theconsequences of war, a situation that sadly bears great similaritywith that of the 1946 post-World War II, which occasioned itsestablishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNICEF estimates that during the last decade, 2 millionchildren have been killed, 4 to 5 million orphaned or separatedfrom their parents and 10 million psychologically traumatized as aresult of wars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Christian leaders in Uganda have made an impassionedplea to Uganda rebel leader Joseph Kony of the Lord's ResistanceArmy (LRA), to end the spate of senseless killings that his rebelforce has been committing in the north against his own Acholipeople.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christian leaders' statement came ahead of a communiquedated June 13 from the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF),stating that 15 people travelling in a pick up in Gulu District ofnorthern Uganda were killed when their vehicle detonated alandmine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The landmine believed to be an anti-tank device was so powerfulit threw the vehicle at least 20 metres into the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christian leaders' statement was signed by the chairman ofthe Uganda Joint Christian Council (UJCC), Emmanuel CardinalWamala. It read: &quot;We address you Joseph Kony as a person whoclaims to be a Christian believer. One of the commandments in theBible and a basic tenet of Christianity is : 'Thou shall notkill'.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement was also addressed to the leader of the pro-IdiAmin West Nile Bank Front (WNFB) who are waging war against thegovernment of President Yoweri Museveni in West Nile in north-eastern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement asked the government to do &quot;everything possible&quot;to bring the suffering of the people of the north to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, President Yoweri Museveni has expressed shock at thekilling of two Acholi elders allegedly by the LRA. The elders,Samson Okot-Ogoni and Olanya-Lagony were killed while on a missionto meet the rebels after initial contacts with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Museveni has said repeatedly that he would not talkto Joseph Kony, citing the numerous atrocities the LRA are knownto have committed in the course of waging war against thegovernment in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, the Uganda Episcopal Conference hasmandated three Bishops - Bishop Dr. Paul Kalanda of Fort Portal,Bishop Adrian Ddungu of Masaka and Bishop Erasmus Wandera ofSoroti to visit Gulu and report on the possibility and modalitiesof dialogue with Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Church in Uganda has also started prayers for therestoration of peace and sanity in the north. A mass held atRubaga Cathedral on June 16 prayed for Joseph Kony's change ofheart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The turn-out for the main mass was described as low. Ugandanleaders and politicians were conspicuously absent.  Local dailyNew Vision reported that neither Cardinal Wamala nor the AuxiliaryBishop Mathias Ssekamanya were present.  -0-(hdLiberiaBishop Warns Liberian Catholics As Institutions Close(byAll Africa Press ServiceJune 24, 1996 (1</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - Liberia's Catholic Archbishop Michael K. Francis haswarned that any church member found to have links with any of thecountry's warring factions will be excommunicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a strongly worded pastoral letter read out at Monrovia'sSacred Heart Cathedral on June 16, Archbishop Francis alsoannounced that all Catholic-run institutions, including healthcentres and schools will be closed until a constitutionallyelected government takes over in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The archbishop was reacting to the continuing insecurity in thecountry, heightened by recent factional fighting which resulted inheavy loss of lives, widespread looting and destruction ofproperty in Monrovia. However, the pastoral letter signed byArchbishop Francis said Catholic churches throughout the countrywill continue to operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Church has been at the forefront of reliefoperations in Liberia during the six-year-old civil war, and theSt. Joseph's Catholic Hospital in Monrovia is regarded as one ofmost efficient in delivering health services. The University ofLiberia's Medical College is attached to the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For years in pre-war Liberia, Catholic schools dominated toppositions in the state exams administered by the West AfricanExaminations Council (WAEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked in a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) interviewwhether he has abandoned the Liberian people, Archbishop Francisreplied: &quot;Of course not, but I am disappointed with the violencethat has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> taken place.&quot; He warned that the church could not afford tocontinue to rebuild while the warring factions continue todestroy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic radio station in Monrovia was among manyfacilities extensively damaged in an orgy of looting during nearlytwo months of bloody factional fighting in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church's decision to close down vital institutions has beendescribed by analysts as a severe blow to humanitarian efforts inLiberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, after 24 days in high seas, a Russian trawlercarrying more than 400 Liberian and other West African refugeestrying to flee the conflict, has returned safely to Monrovia afterit was turned away by neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivory Coast, Ghana, Togo and Benin, are all said to haverefused to grant permission for the ship to dock at their ports,arguing that they did not want to encourage a further influx ofrefugees from Liberia. The vessel, Zolotitsa (Little golden one)left Monrovia on May 26 with its cargo of about 450 refugees andwas reported missing at one stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before its arrival back in Monrovia, aid workers using a lightplane mounted an unsuccessful search for the ship for more than aweek. Aid workers who visited the ship after its arrival at theFreeport of Monrovia are quoted saying conditions on board weresqualid, but that the passengers were in good shape. There were nodeaths reported among the passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned of analarming health situation developing in Liberia's north-westernLofa county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement released here on June 18 following an assessmentmission to the county, the WHO described health conditions thereas &quot;alarming, and there was an urgent need for humanitarianassistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO said some of the health facilities in Lofa &quot;are in poorcondition while others have been completely destroyed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Curran Memorial Hospital in Zorzor, formerly run by theLiberian Lutheran Church, &quot;is completely burnt down, while theTellewoyen Hospital in Voinjama was in dire need of renovation torestore it to its former status.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO, however, said four health facilities in upper Lofacounty were still catering to some 348,000 people, 44 per cent ofwhom are Sierra Leonean refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement quoted physicians at the four health facilitiessaying that malaria, acute respiratory infection and diarrhoeaaccount for 60 per cent of out-patient cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A week earlier, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) delivered 380tonnes of badly needed relief food to Lofa &quot;to ease the acute foodshortage facing thousands of war-weary citizens&quot; in that county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Few non-governmental aid agencies are active outside Monrovia,having reduced their operations when factional fighting broke outin the capital early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 11 more than a dozen NGOs announced they would limittheir work in Liberia to emergencies only until conditionsimproved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said persistent looting of their vehicles and equipment byarmed factions was prolonging the civil conflict that has ragedsince 1989, making their presence in the West African country moreharmful than beneficial to Liberian civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, at least 470 bodies have been recoveredand buried in the main cemetery in Monrovia by a health teamsearching for victims of Liberia's latest factional fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief government pathologist Isaac Moses, supervising thesearch, said on June 18 the bodies were found in several parts ofthe city, including areas around the Greystone displaced personscentre in the diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the search for and reburial of the bodies started twoweeks ago, with bodies recovered including 150 exhumed on beachesin Mamba Point on June 17 and reburied by the health team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Church and government of Zambia have disagreed onthe May 28 signing of the Mwanakatwe Constitution Amendment Bill,barring former President Kenneth Kaunda and his United NationalIndependence Party (UNIP) deputy senior chief Inyambo Yeta fromcontesting presidential and parliamentary elections scheduled forOctober this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic bishops have further rejected the inclusion of thedeclaration of Zambia as a &quot;Christian Nation&quot; in the preamble ofthe new Constitution of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They feel this could be the beginning of a state religion inthe country, Acting Secretary General at the Catholic Secretariatin Lusaka Fr. Joe Komakoma has said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;President Fredrick Chiluba's government has not respected therecommendations made by the Mwanakatwe Constitution ReviewCommission that Zambia shall not adopt a state religion. Thismeans the government has no respect for the wishes of the peoplebecause something that has been rejected by the MwanakatweConstitution Review Commission is now being forced on us,&quot; saidFr. Komakoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Komakoma, who is the Executive Secretary of the CatholicCommission for Justice and Peace (CCJP), said the position of theCatholic bishops as contained in their pastoral letter, had notchanged in view of the declaration of Zambia as a Christiannation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their pastoral letter, The Future is Ours of 1992, and anOpen Letter to President Chiluba and Members of Parliament, datedApril 26,1996, the Catholic Bishops maintained that a nation'sChristian character could not be identified by such declarationsbut by its deeds of justice and concern for the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Komakoma said the arrogance of the MMD government was againreflected in the lack of theological conference or debate on theissue to discuss the implications of the inclusion of thedeclaration in the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government said that the declaration of Zambia as aChristian nation did not mean punishing people who belonged toother religions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba pointed out that on the contrary, people withdifferent religions are free to practise what they believe inwithout interference from anybody. He noted that Christianity wasnot an exercise in vanity but embraced spiritual ideals intendedfor the good of the believers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a recent United Church of Zambia (UCZ) fund-raising dinnerdance held in the northern town of Ndola, where President Chilubawas guest of honour, Rev. Valerie Ogden in the company of Rev.Mwape Chilekwa, welcoming President Chiluba, complained about thehigh import duty that the Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) subjectedthe church to when receiving donations from overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Ogden said the ZRA sometimes charges twice the originalvalue of the donated items. This kind of attitude does not reflecta Christian nation as the government does not value the donationsthe church receives from sister organisations overseas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is unfortunate that the government has not listened to thebishops, but as long as they (authorities) do not abide by gooddeeds, the inclusion of Zambia as a Christian nation in theConstitution would not change the character of this nation,&quot; addedFr. Komakoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, Bishop Stephen Mumba of Lusaka AnglicanDiocese pointed out that people are Christians without Zambiabeing pronounced Christian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He requested the MMD government to let Christians worship Godas they have always done in the past saying, Zambia as a secularstate was better than it is now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It does not mean that when Zambia is a Christian nation thegovernment is perfect. We have known of countries where the Biblehas been used to oppress others,&quot; cautioned Bishop Mumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Church has told the MMD Government that barring formerPresident Kaunda from running for elections defeats the wholepurpose of declaring Zambia a Christian nation because in such anation every citizen has the right to contest presidential andparliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed here that since President Chiluba was elected asthe MMD leader, even the voter registration exercise has had aninauspicious beginning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Church, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) andopposition parties are geared to dialogue with government toreverse the assented constitution to allow former PresidentKenneth Kaunda to contest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lately, Zambia has experienced a series of bombings andexplosions launched by the hitherto shadowy group calling itselfBlack Mamba which the MMD government has linked with UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A police bomb disposal expert, Ordon Banda, was killed on June7, 1996 and his colleague Paul Ngoma seriously wounded when a bombplaced under a lavatory seat at Lusaka International Airport wentoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on June 19, UNIP's deputy, chief Inyambo Yeta, KennethKaunda's press aide Muhabi Lungu and six others appeared before aLusaka court to answer charges linking them to terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight are accused of being behind the Black Mamba, a groupunder whose name bombs have been planted in various parts of thecountry as a protest sign against laws barring the former Zambianpresident from running for presidency, come elections in October.</SPAN></P>

Some 20,000 spectators watched the finals at the National Stadium in Sururele, a Lagos neighbourhood, with the 100 metre race for men and women as major highlights. African track queen Mary Onyali-Omagbemi beat all comers in the women's 100-metre race, finishing in 10.67 seconds. She also won gold in the women's 200-metre race. Davidson Ezinwa, nother United States-based sprinter, won the men's 100-metre dash with a time of 9.86 seconds. But the times are subject to confirmation because officials said they were manually recorded.  Two of Nigeria's four athletes, Chioma Ajunwa and Clement Chukwu, made impressive comeback after serving their four-year ban by the International Athletics Federation. Chioma came second behind Onyali-Omagemi in the 100-metre women's race and picked up the gold in the long jump. Chukwu, on the other hand, placed third in the 400 metres behind policeman Sunday Bada and Jude Monye who placed first and second in the explosive race. Two other returnees Charity Okpara and Innocent Asonze were not as lucky.  (DOCUMENT) US Groups Plan March and Vigil Against Dictatorship in Zaire</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Following the collapse of a supermarket that killed16 people in downtown Nairobi on May 14 this year, CatholicBishops of Kenya issued a statement blaming the incident on suchvices as corruption and neglect.  Similar sentiments were expressedby the Catholic Bishops of Mwanza, the Rt.  Rev. Anthony Mayala inthe aftermath of the ferry tragedy on Lake Victoria that cost thelives of more than 600 people mid-May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 70 Ethiopians being smuggled illegally into SaudiArabia were burnt to death when a ship they were sailing in wasengulfed in flames, off Massawa, Eritrea in early June. It isbelieved that petrol was stored on board on makeshift containers.An explosion ensued when one of the passengers or crew lit acigarette.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, it is common to find petrol and other flammablematerials regularly ferried in passenger compartments of vehiclesand boats. One is almost certain the Massawa tragedy is not thelast one of a similar nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In mid-May, an extension to the verandah roof of SunbeamSupermarket situated on a busy Nairobi street collapsed. Hugeboulders falling on a crowd sheltering from a torrential downpourkilled 16 people and left 50 others seriously injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Bishops of Kenya lamented that such tragedies werecaused by rampant corruption and negligence on the part ofplanners, construction companies and surveyors. The chairman ofthe Kenya Episcopal Conference Archbishop Zacheus Okoth, who sentcondolences to the bereaved families urged the government toprosecute negligent builders and launch intensive scrutiny of allupcoming structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An enquiry is under way, but surprisingly, it is not acommission of enquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aware that corruption had thoroughly destroyed the credibilityof their trade, the 14,000 strong Kenya Union of Architects andBuilders issued a belated statement, What Might Have Happened andWhat Should Be Done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The professionals agreed that henceforth inspection ofbuildings should be mandatory. This practice was common in thepast, particularly in the colonial period when building standardswere rigorously enforced. Indeed when a cinema hall collapsed inNairobi in 1954 killing one person, the colonial administratorsinstituted a commission of enquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barely one week after the mid-May Nairobi supermarket tragedy,a bigger disaster occurred on Lake Victoria, Africa's largestfresh water body. A condemned steamer capsized at dawn on May 21claiming more than 600 lives. The accident occurred only eightkilometres from the ship's destination port of Mwanza, Tanzania.The accident apparently happened in calm water and was initiallyblamed on overloading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has since emerged that the steamship was unseaworthy, a factthat was clearly known to its owners, the Tanzanian RailwayCorporation (TRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fact many find difficult to comprehend is an advertisementappearing in the government owned Uhuru daily dated April 30,announcing the vessel's operation had been withdrawn due toserious mechanical problems. The ship was supposed to have gonestraight into a dry dock for mandatory repairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A marine electrical engineer named Kamuli Magolanga survivedthe tragedy by the sheer grace of God and because he was aware ofthe inherent dangers. He donned a life jacket right from theoutset when the M.V. Bukoba sailed out of Bukoba on the westernshores of Lake Victoria on the night of May 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I put on my life jacket because I knew something was terriblywrong with the vessel's balance mechanism. I believe the TRC knewbetter,&quot; declared Magolanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ill fated M.V. Bukoba carried some 250 people above thestated capacity of 450 passengers. Other survivors say the ferrywas carrying as many as 1,000 people. The true figure may never beknown since President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania abruptlyterminated body salvage operations due to the advanced stage ofdecomposition of unrecovered bodies that were still entombed inthe vessel, 100 feet under water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But overloading may still not have been the only factor in theill- fated accident since the ship had a high capacity for cargowhich was only fractionally utilised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The M.V. Bukoba was not insured. Another disturbing revelationwas that the supplier of the vessel, a Belgian company, knew thedesign was inherently faulty. A Belgian government officialaccepted partial responsibility for the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not clear however if Belgium will help boost acompensation fund for victims' families. Tanzanian embassiesabroad are collecting money for voluntary compensation to affectedfamilies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Anthony Mayala of the Catholic Diocese of Mwanza thankedthe government, the Red Cross, Caritas and numerous well wishersfor all help offered in the recovery of bodies and subsequentinterment. The government also fed the thousands who thronged theharbour at Mwanza awaiting word about their loved ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 4, a flotilla of boats comprising members of variousreligious - Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and Hindus, - sailed outfrom Mwanza to the spot where the tragedy occurred. &quot;We took thewhole lake as a graveyard and blessed it. It was a deeply touchingservice for the departed souls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Mayala lamented that such tragedies &quot;happen when peoplefail to take care; when people do not fulfil their duty...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He lost six missionaries in the Mwanza tragedy. Three CanossianSisters, one Daughter of St Mary and two Ugandan Brothers of theBanakaroli Brothers of Kisubi, near Kampala, perished. Among manyothers also lost in this tragedy were choir members of theEvangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) Bugando parish.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A recent report by the United Nations Food andAgriculture Organization (FAO) gives a very grim scenario of thefood situation in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FAO which closely monitors the global food situation, says inits May 29 report that about 220 million people in sub-SaharanAfrica are currently facing food emergencies of varying intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 48 countries in the region require cereal importation ofabout 12.7 million tonnes for the period 1995/96, some 5 per centmore than the actual amount received in the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Abdur Rashid, head of FAO's Global Information and EarlyWarning System, which published the report warns that &quot;Africa'sprecarious food security could lead to a genuine human tragedy.&quot;Already 210 million people in Africa suffer from hunger andundernutrition, 40 per cent of the continent's population.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sub-Saharan Africa has fared poorly against other world foodproducers since the 1970s and there are no signs of imminentimprovement in the food supply even in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This factor is brought about by Africa's over reliance onhighly variable and erratic rainfall. Worse still is the problemof recurrent severe droughts which precipitate large scale sub-regional food emergencies, such as those of 1972/71, 1983/84,1992/93 and 1994/95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Land degradation due to soil erosion also contributes to lowfood production in the region. In 1991/92, some three milliontonnes of grain worth US$700 million - food for 25 million peoplewere lost to drought and desert encroachment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rising population pressure has also resulted in the decline infarm size as land is converted into other uses. The effect is seenin the annual population growth rate at an average 3 per cent,compared to a low 1.9 per cent increase in food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In East Africa alone, there are some 9 million people currentlyfacing food shortages including some 7 million from the Horn ofAfrica.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prospects in Southern and Western Africa are not promising.A fairly good number of people from these regions need food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Southern Africa for instance, where favourable harvests areexpected following the generally good rainfall although with aslow start in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe, somecountries may still record low harvests, says the FAO report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FAO country profile shows that Angola's yield may beaffected by input shortages in some regions as a result oftransport difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique has experienced a double tragedy -- an acute dryspell in January followed by flooding in February. Both extremeshave adversely affected maize production in the country's southernprovinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia too can only expect a dismal harvest following aninvasion of the large grain borer, a new pest in the country thathas jeopardized expectations of bumper crop. In Madagascar, lastJanuary cyclones will affect rice production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FAO report reveals an overall satisfactory food supply inWest Africa with the exception of Liberia and Sierra Leone.Traditionally food deficit countries like Burkina Faso, Chad, Maliand Niger will also experience localized food difficulties. Theextents vary from country to country with seriously threatenednations like Burkina Faso and Niger, having launched an appeal forinternational food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burkina Faso with a population of 9.5 million people isadversely affected in the northern parts of the country, requiringabout 24,000 tonnes of food for some 700,000 affected persons in17 provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the FAO report notes that sub-Saharan Africa'sprecarious food security outlook, takes place as global cerealsupplies tighten and food aid availabilities shrink, resulting insharp increases in cereal prices on the world market. The highcost of cereal imports, coupled with balance of payments in fooddeficit countries further undermines the region's food security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eritrea which for example requires 191,000 tonnes of food aidto fill the gap created by a poor harvest has so far received only58,000 tonnes of food pledges, less than one third of the totalrequirements, yet, only 8 per cent of this assistance has beendelivered so far. The FAO report calls for prompt delivery tourgently avert an impending food emergency in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in some countries the food deficit is the result ofunfavourable ecological conditions, for others, it is purely dueto political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries like Liberia, Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan and to someextent, Somalia have experienced political clashes that forcepeople to flee their farms and seek refuge elsewhere, thusescalating food demand in such areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years, such trends have led to a rapid rise incommercial food imports and food aid which have registered annualgrowth rates of 4 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in spite of these food inflows, food intake per person iscurrently estimated at around 87 per cent of the requirement,implying growing chronic undernutrition, observes FAO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation generally seems to be getting worse, given thepoor balance of payment position and crushing debt burden of mostsub- Saharan African countries, exacerbated by a rise in grainprices on the world market and dwindling global food aidavailabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this background, the international community isrequired amongst other things to focus attention on how the lowincome food deficit countries of sub-Saharan Africa would gettheir food aid to meet minimum requirements for 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasing Africa's food output also calls for a significantexpansion of irrigation activities in farming. The absurd truth isthat of sub-Saharan Africa's irrigation potential estimated ataround 33 million hectares, only 16 per cent are currently underuse, leaving 27.7 million hectares unutilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, 68 per cent of the irrigated land in the region wasconcentrated in three countries namely</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan (30 per cent), Madagascar (17 per cent) and South Africa(20 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the FAO report acknowledges that the full irrigationpotential may be constrained by economic and technical factors butadds that tapping even only 10 per cent of the potential couldlead to full substitution of cereal imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report further observes that applying supplementaryirrigation to rain fed crops would minimize the water stresscaused by short, dry spells during the growing season and, thussubstantially raise rain fed production as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides its basic function of meeting crop water requirements,irrigation increases the impact of other yield-enhancingtechnologies, particularly of fertilizer applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the foregoing, UN agencies targeting food securityglobally need to focus on concerns like soil degradation, controlof desertification, access to water, supporting sustainable livingconditions in marginal environmental zones and introduction ofeffective low cost technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survival of 200 million people in the Sahel and Horn ofAfrica now depends on efforts to reverse the trend of landdegradation and desertification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is perhaps against this realization that the Convention toCombat Desertification convened a meeting on June 17 this year, tofocus on the need to maximize efforts by the internationalcommunity to contain progressive desertification especially inAfrica, but also in Asia, Latin America, Southern Europe and partsof Northern America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And from November 13 to 17 1996, world leaders will assemble inRome, Italy at a meeting called by FAO, to make public commitmentto eliminate hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This assembly will provide a historic opportunity forgovernments, international organizations and all sectors of civilsociety to join forces in a concerted campaign to ensure foodsecurity - access at all times to the food required for a healthy,active life of a human being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This summit is coming at a time when the global populationwhich today stands at some 5.7 billion, is projected to top 8billion by 2020. The population increase will be experiencedmostly in the developing world, where constraints to increasedfood production are daunting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - &quot;The public is hereby informed that from now on fuelused by the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) at all fuelstations in the country will be coloured green,&quot; reads anannouncement being broadcast over state radio every several hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement by Uganda's Defence Ministry follows a seriesof other media statements, one of which recently called for freshrecruitment of local militias in the strife torn northern regionof this East African country, to back up government troops aheadof a plan to militarily occupy the north and evacuate hundreds ofthousands civilians to &quot;safe camps&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, running side by side of the media announcements,are declarations on rebels fighting to unseat President YoweriMuseveni's government from the improvised northern region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As recently as June 13, church leaders made yet another appealto President Yoweri Museveni and the rebel leaders to end thefighting in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement signed by the Roman Catholic Archbishop CardinalEmmanuel Wamala who chairs the Uganda Joint Christian Council(UJCC), the churches expressed their willingness to promotedialogue and reconciliation between Museveni's government, theLord's Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony, and the West NileBank Front (WNBF) led by Juma Oris.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this year, Cardinal Wamala had urged Museveni to seek apolitical solution to the fighting in the north, a proposal thePresident rejected, vowing that &quot;he would crush and finish therebels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rebels are in disarray and will be crushed shortly --there are only a tail of the insurgency,&quot; is a common phrase bytop Uganda government officials including President Museveni whenreferring to the northern conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government owned New Vision daily is carrying reports of 20to 50 rebels being killed by the UPDF and hundreds of others beingcaptured in various attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a senior Defence Minister official who spoke on conditionof anonymity confirms some reports in privately owned Kampalanewspapers which indicate that between 10 and 20 governmentsoldiers are being ambushed by rebels or killed in dissidentlandmine attacks during various skirmishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Museveni has often publicly admitted that the expansebushy terrain in the north is giving his 10,000 strong armydifficulty in transversing. The army is dominated by soldiers fromthe heavily populated and vegetated south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several top Uganda government officials, including close aidesto President Museveni like his half brother and military advisormajor general Salim Saleh, blamed political and economic factorsfor the war in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1986 when the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM)government came to power, there has been magical growth of themajority south and south-western parts of the country, to theextent of putting this East African country on the list of whatforeign donors categorize as fastest growing economies in Africa,with a growth rate of 8 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This growth which donors say is a result of an impressiveliberalization and investment programme, has however not beenshared by the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When one travels from the south of Uganda to the north, it islike travelling from earth to another planet. From civilization tobackwardness, spotted with worm infested feet and emaciatedchildren --- one is not surprised that there is a rebellion in thearea at all,&quot; said a senior United Nations World Food Programme(WFP) official who did not want to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The north is home to 2.5 million of Uganda's 18 millionpopulation. &quot;The two parts of Uganda should have been differentcountries,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cecilia Ogwal, a well known fiery official of former presidentDr. Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress (UPC) which has ruledUganda for most of the period since independence from Britishcolonial rule in 1962 and during which, the army, then dominatedby ethnic northern soldiers killed thousands of southerners, says:&quot;The people in the north look at the UPDF as a foreign force outto avenge their tribal connection with Obote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;President Museveni and his NRM, which analysts interpret asthe first uprising by the southerners against decades of northernrule, should know that the mistakes of Obote and (former Ugandandictator) Idi Amin (a northerner) should not be meted out to thelocal people,&quot; Ogwal observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UPC Official was apparently referring to atrocitiesallegedly committed by UPDF soldiers against the civilianpopulation in the north, some of which have been publicly admittedby the Ugandan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most vivid one was in the north-eastern Soroti District inMukura village, where several years ago, hundreds of civilianswere suffocated in a disused train wagon by government troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says a senior army officer; &quot;One cannot blame these Kadogos,&quot; -young orphans from the south whose parents were killed bygovernment troops during the Obote regime in the early 1980's andwere forced to join Museveni's guerrilla war to defend themselvesand are now part of the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If your mother and father are slaughtered infront of you andyou meet one of those who did it what should you do? ... The UPDFis not a force of angels,&quot; the official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebel conflict in northern Uganda has since 1987 beencentred around the towns of Kitgum and Gulu, 50 kilometres fromthe border with Sudan. The uprising which began after the NRMcaptured power in Kampala ousting Obote's mainly ethnic northernsoldiers from the Ugandan capital to the north of the country, haswidened to embrace the West Nile District which encompasses largeareas bordering Sudan. Uganda has accused Sudan of arming therebels, a charge which Khartoum denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local state media including independent newspapers in thecapital Kampala which have been previously mentioning the rebelLord's Resistance Army (LRA) commanded by Joseph Kony, are nowfrequently also referring to another group of insurgents, thedissidents West Nile Bank Front (WNBF) led by Idi Amin's formerforeign minister colonel Juma Oris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Amin rebels whom the government alleges infiltrated thenorth- western region from southern Sudan in groups of 1000 arereported to have blown up several bridges leading to the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict in northern Uganda intensified after the May 9general election in which President Museveni, who has ruled thecountry for the past ten years, trounced his two opponents with74.3 per cent of the votes, clinching another five-year term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the election, the LRA and WNBF had called for aceasefire and advised Ugandans to vote for Museveni's major rivalDr. Paul Ssemogerere, who warned that there would be an out-breakof full scale war in the north if the elections were rigged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And indeed no sooner had Ssemogerere rejected the electionresults in which he polled a mere 23.7 per cent of the ballotsthan the northern conflict intensified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state owned New Vision daily reported late May thatparliamentary elections in two counties in the north-west havebeen postponed as a result of insecurity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the election whose procedure and outcome were okayed bylocal and international poll monitors, Ssemogerere swept theentire north with between 80 and 90 per cent of the votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The election was a clear result of rejection by thenortherners of President Museveni's government. Now they haverealised that they can never return to power or even get a fairamount of the economic cake by the ballot, they have resorted toforce,&quot; a northern parliamentarian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say that UPC had hoped to bring northern Uganda backinto the country's political arena through its alliance withSsemogerere, a member of the majority southern Buganda tribe, byexploiting the ethnic group's disappointment at the NRM's refusalto grant Kabakaship or ancient mornachy its century longinfluential political status and autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Museveni's campaign reminder of the 1980-1985 Obote regime,during which the four million strong Baganda suffered killings andlooting of property by government troops and the formerpresident's 1966 abolition of their monarchy, outweighed all theseconsiderations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Basking in his landslide victory and his imminent success inthe June parliamentary polls, Museveni has made it clear he willnot negotiate with key northern rebel leader Joseph Kony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after he was sworn into office on May 12, Musevenireminded Ugandans of his earlier stance on the LRA leader, sayinghis job was &quot;to kill Kony.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement broadcast over Radio Uganda and TelevisionMuseveni on June 3 said he will give priority to &quot;areas thatsupported my political programmes in political appointments. It isnot discrimination because it does not affect the development ofthe country which I will make uniform.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The June 3 appeal from the leader of Uganda's majority CatholicChurch, asking Museveni to negotiate with Kony and accommodate thehostile north in his government plans, seems to have had littleeffect in placating the president's stand. Ssemogerere is astaunch Catholic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers fear that Western donors who are concentrating on thedevelopment of the rich and wetter majority southern part ofUganda will sit on the fence and watch the drier and minoritynorth burn to ashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one American businessman privately put it when confrontedwith the northern Ugandan conflict: &quot;What matters is Kampala andEntebbe (Uganda's international airport 26 kilometres south of thecapital).&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) hascalled on churches to intensify their pastoral services among theuprooted people on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message sent out to all the AACC member churches, to markthe June 16 to 23 Week of Prayer and Confession in Africa for theUprooted People, General Secretary Rev. Jose Chipenda acknowledgedefforts by churches in Africa to provide assistance to theuprooted through the AACC and the Geneva-based World Council ofChurches (WCC) but cautioned that they can still do more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The churches on the continent for example, have not adequatelyspoken against injustices perpetrated in African countries,resulting in forced movements of people, laments the AACC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pan-African religious body, which represents 142 memberchurches and a number of affiliated national christian councils in39 countries, also cited other factors which prompted the markingof the week of prayer and confession for the continent's churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These include the ineffectiveness of the churches' role inpreventing uprootedness by tackling the underlying causes;reaffirmation of the urgent need for the churches to adopt a firmstand for justice and peace in the name of the gospel; the needfor solidarity with the uprooted people; and creation of publicawareness and sensitivity to the problems of Africa in general anduprooted people in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The week of prayer and confession in Africa was instituted in1995, after a series of meetings organised by the refugee andemergency service departments of the AACC and WCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A document from the AACC says A Week of Prayer and Confessionin Africa , was designed to give churches, in particular thoseworking within the refugee and emergency services areas, a periodto meditate, reflect and even confess the &quot;sins&quot;, they might havecommitted in their services among the uprooted people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document also thanks the WCC for its proposal that 1997 bea year of solidarity with uprooted people, describing the idea ascommendable. &quot;Our week of prayer is a prelude, which will help toprepare people to be more responsive to the needs of the uprootedby first taking responsibility for them (uprooted) uponthemselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an earlier message informing all AACC-member churches of thedecision to mark the week of prayer and confession in Africa, theAACC General Secretary noted that although churches on the African</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> continent in collaboration with the AACC and WCC have beenaddressing themselves to the uprooted people and particularly therefugees, their number (uprooted people) has steadily increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Inspite of these efforts, the number of the uprooted peoplehas been increasing steadily,&quot; observed Rev. Chipenda. Africa hasan estimated 8 million refugees,representing about one third ofthe world's refugee population; well over 15 million internallydisplaced persons and several more millions of migrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that the AACC has decentralized the operationsof its refugees and emergency services to ensure effectiveparticipation of the churches in the work for and with theuprooted people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the WCC has developed a policy statement onthe uprooted people which was approved by its central committeelast September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AACC week of prayer and confession was designed to coincidewith the African Refugee Day of the Organisation for African Unity(OAU), which is celebrated annually on June 20.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - There was some cheerful economic news during the lastweekend of May 1996 from the Vice Minister of the Ministry of EconomicDevelopment and Cooperation, Ato Mekonnen Manyazewal. He said thegovernment would not borrow money from the domestic banking systemduring the current fiscal year of 1995/96 which runs from the end ofJune through July (&quot;Addis Zemen,&quot; Ginbot 17, 1988 E.C.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that the government's remarkable prospectivefinancial independence from the domestic banking system includes notjust the current budget but the capital budget as well. If it turns outto be true, it is a fiscal first worthy of a full page in the annals ofEthiopian financial history.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But is it really true that the government will not resort to thedomestic banking system during 1995/96? Has it not already takenrecourse to it? There is hardly any doubt that the government has,during the course of 1995/96, already borrowed from the banking system,which includes the National Bank of Ethiopia, the Commercial Bank ofEthiopia (CBE) and other state-owned and private banks, through variousborrowing mechanisms, mainly direct advances and treasury bills. It iswell known that the CBE is a major player on the domestic monthly 91-daytreasury bills auction market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, what the V. Minister perhaps meant to say was that the governmentwould not incur any additional domestic debt during the current fiscalyear. This could possibly happen if the government repaid, includinginterest, all its borrowings during 1995/96 from the domestic bankingsystem before the fiscal year runs out. Since the fiscal year still has,at the time of writing, some one month and nine days to go it would bepresumptuous to try to predict the outcome in this respect with onehundred percent certainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The V. Minister's announcement of the government's financialindependence from the domestic banking system at least for the currentfiscal year is premised on the assumption that domestic governmentrevenue for 1995/96 would amount to a record-breaking total of 7.1billion birr, registering a phenomenal increase of 1.4 billion birr (ornearly 25 percent) over 5.7 billion birr domestic revenue realized in1994/95 (&quot;Addis Zemen&quot;, Ginbot 17, 1988 E.C.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, the 7.1 billion birr figure is an estimate not onlybecause an actual figure cannot be obtained when there is still over amonth before the fiscal year is out, but because there is usually a lagof at least three months before even preliminary actual fiscal figurescan be made available. As a matter fact, even figures for 1992/93 arestill at the &quot;preliminary actual&quot; of stage!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence, the 7.1 billion birr domestic revenue figure cited by the V.Minister is only a projection, not an actual outcome. Several questionscould be raised concerning this very important fiscal estimate,including the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - What are the major sources of the remarkable increases in domesticrevenue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Does it include foreign grants in kind, in cash and in what areknown as counterpart funds? (Such foreign grants are estimated to haveamounted to over 1 billion birr in 1994/95).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - In the light of the immediately foregoing query, would it be rightto attribute all the 7.1 billion to domestic revenue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - How is it possible for there to be such a large increase indomestic revenue when there have been substantial reductions in taxrates, including those on business profits, personal income and imports.Has tax collection improved that much? Has the economy been expandingall that rapidly? There is plenty of room for doubt here!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - Why cite a projected figure rather than an actual figure in thefirst place? It would have been more appropriate to give whatever actualor preliminary actual figure (say for 8 or 9 months of E. FY 1995/96) isavailable and compare it with the corresponding figure for 1994/95 thanto indulge in speculation when making definitive policy statements suchas: &quot;the government will not borrow money from the domestic bankingsystem in E. FY 1995/96&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - How does such a policy statement reconcile with the followingstatement made recently by the Prime Minister: &quot;On the whole, 13 -14billion birr is needed to cover rural roads and highway constructionover the five-year period (or about 2.7 billion annually)? Thegovernment's total capital expenditure in 1994/95 was estimated at alittle over 3 billion birr. If 2.7 billion birr is required annually forthe road construction programme alone, how can the government helptaking recourse to the domestic banking system in the future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To sum up, first contrary to what the V. Minister stated, thegovernment has borrowed from the domestic banking system during E. FY1995/96, and there are indications that it has incurred additional debton its treasury bills account during the year, although its debtposition with the banking system on aggregate appears to have declinedappreciably. At any rate, reducing the government's outstanding internaldebt does not necessarily mean that there has been no governmentborrowing from the banking system during E. FY 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, since there is still some way to go before the end of the1995/96 fiscal year, it is conceivable that further credit accommodationmay be sought by the government from the banking system, although thismay not substantially affect the overall net favorable internal debtposition of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirdly, the 7.1 billion birr figure cited is a projection not anactual outcome. It would have been better to quote the available actualor preliminary actual figure and compare it with its correspondingfigure for 1994/95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourthly, the major sources of the very substantial increase. Issue cover date: June 14</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - According to the latest Ethiopian Free PressJournalists Association's (EFJA) report, more than 150 journalists havebeen put in jail for short or long periods of time during the past fiveyears. Over thirty two editors and publishers have also been, it said,fined a total of 45,000 birr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EFJA named journalists Getahun Bekele, Andargue Mesfin and SissayAgena as 'convicted prisoners' currently serving from 12 to 36 monthterms at the Central State Prison. Two others, Kumsa Burayu and TsegayeMeskalu are listed as 'missing independent journalists'. EFJA listed tenother names as 'unconvicted independent journalists'. A further nineteenwere cited as 'released independent journalist prisoners', having beenheld in prison from a week up to a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quarterly journal published by the US-based Committee to ProtectJournalists (CPJ) also had something to say on freedom of press in thecountry. In its Spring 1996 issue, CPJ reported that at the end of 1995,'For the third consecutive year, Ethiopia held more journalists in jail- 31 at years end - than any other country in Africa. Most were detainedwithout charges.' CPJ also noted that 'upcoming elections in severalcountries, including Ivory Coast (Cote d'Ivoire). Ethiopia and Chad,proved reason enough for governments to impose greater restrictions - ifnot all-out crack downs - on the media'. Fifty-three journalists werealso said to have been 'killed in the line of duty' over the past tenyears in thirteen African countries - three of them in Ethiopia, fifteenin Rwanda and nine in Somalia</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Investors can borrow money from abroad subject to registration bythe National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE);</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Land will be made available to licensed investors in 60 days;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And now for our comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reduction in the minimum capital required for investment may behelpful, but it is not going to be decisive in attracting foreigninvestors.  In this connection, it does not make much sense to say thatthe amount of foreign retained profits and dividends to be invested inexisting enterprises cannot be less than 40,000 US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suppose just 35,000 US dollars is required for a minor expansion orimprovement in existing facilities. Is this going to be prohibited?  Theabolition of the requirement for 125,000 US dollar prior deposit forforeign investors is also a positive step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So is the opening up of more sectors for foreign investors such ashotel development below the four-star and five-star grade levels;however, it is doubtful whether there is an urgent need for foreigninvestment in real estate development such as the construction of high-rise buildings for rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This can quite easily be done by domestic investors provided foreigncontractors are available where domestic construction capacity islimited. In other words, foreign investment in the construction industryis highly welcome but not in the construction of high-rise buildings andvillas for rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, foreign investment in varying degrees would havebeen helpful in banking and insurance and small-scale air transport andelectricity supply services where foreign technical know-how would bevaluable. For example, in the banking and insurance sector a foreignequity participation of, say, up to 15 - 20 percent, together with theaccompanying foreign management participation, would have been helpfulin acquiring modern banking and insurance techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a similar vein, why is foreign investment not allowed in thefollowing sectors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Rail transport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Telecommunications</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Electricity generation with capacity above 25 megawatts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, why is foreign investment restricted to only joint ventureabove 20 million US dollars capital in the following sectors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Engineering and metallurgy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Pharmaceuticals production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Basic chemical and petro-chemical industries, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Fertilizer industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are all production activities where not only foreign technicalexpertise but also capital is badly needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draft proclamation does not say much about the eligibilitycriteria for investment incentives and the types of incentives to begranted, although the former are said to be based on the country'sinvestment objectives and the latter are mentioned as generally coveringtax holidays and loss carry-over privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lifting of the 250,000 birr minimum capital required foreligibility for investment incentives in the case of domestic investorsis welcome, but the proposed investment authority would need to be well-prepared to handle much more investment licensing and otheradministrative processing than is being done at present.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the question of borrowing from abroad, it is not clear whetherboth foreign and domestic investors are allowed to do this subject toregistration by the NBE. If this is the case, then remittances forforeign debt servicing should be allowed for domestic investors as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most dramatic revision in the new draft investmentproclamation is that land for investment will be made available in 60days. The revision is highly welcome and long overdue, but theinevitable question would be: is the revision practical in the light ofthe gross inefficiency of the government bureaucracy and the additionalcomplications the government land lease policy has created? Besides, twomonths is not a short time. Even then, in the present Ethiopiancircumstances the amendment is too good to be practicable!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the draft proclamation has not addressed two importinvestment issues, namely investment in financial instruments such astreasury bills, bonds, stocks and other securities; and the question ofresidence and nationality. In connection with the latter, what is goingto be the fate of Eritreans who are now widely engaged in activitiesreserved for Ethiopian nationals only? It may be a politically sensitivequestion, but it cannot be evaded indefinitely! On the other hand, thebroader investment issues would include the following doubts andapprehensions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - It is doubtful whether an investor will get land in 60 days asstipulated in the draft investment proclamation even though this may beconsidered a pretty long time by many people. The further questions toask at this point would be: In how many days would an investor get waterelectricity and telephone connections? How long would it take him toobtain a bank loan, to clear his imported goods through customs, etc.?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - What is the difference between Ethiopians and foreigners withrespect to land tenure? Apparently there is no difference. They are bothleaseholders! The national interest should be protected where it mattersmost!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Oppenheimer heirs -- Anglo American deputychairman Nicky Oppenheimer and Mary Slack -- met President NelsonMandela at his Houghton home last week to discuss the possibletakeover by the National Empowerment Consortium of AngloAmerican's press interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the meeting hadbroached a range of issues, but he refused to confirm or denywhether the matter of the press interests had been raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian understands that Oppenhemier and Slackvoiced concern about the possible control of the publicationsowned by Times Media Limited (TML), which publishes Business Day,Sunday Times and Financial Mail. TML is part of the Johnnic group,the collection of Anglo American assets earmarked for sale in amajor black empowerment deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possible exercise of editorial control by the NationalEmpowerment Consortium, the group of companies bidding forJohnnic, prompted senior TML officials to draw up an editorialcharter, effectively enshrining the publications' editorialindependence and preserving the publications' Anglo traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that the consortium, which includes New AfricaInvestments Limited (Nail), has scoffed at the idea of such acharter.  Ironically, TML first encountered the idea of aneditorial charter when it was eyeing New Nation, the weeklynewspaper now owned by Nail. TML frowned at New Nation'ssuggestion of a charter, saying editorial control would have torest with it. Nail also owns the Sowetan and is bidding for one ofthe SABC radio stations up for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The M&amp;G understands the meeting between Mandela and theOppenheimers was intended to focus on the continued independenceof the press if and when it comes under black control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, and it has not been lost on the ANC, it was Slack'sformer husband, Gordon Waddell, in his executive position atAnglo, who was primarily responsible for closing a former TMLpublication, and its flagship the Rand Daily Mail. Senior ANCmembers are riled that Anglo is suddenly worried about pressindependence on the eve of possible black ownership of itspublications.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - One of South Africa's most trumpeted blackempowerment deals to date is floundering badly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the negotiating team thrashing out theNational Empowerment Consortium's bid for a collection of stakesin Anglo American companies say that, after a heavy round of talkson Youth Day, the deal seems to be in peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consortium bidding for the Anglo companies includes NewAfrica Investments Limited (Nail), and its negotiating team isheaded by outgoing African National Congress secretary generalCyril Ramaphosa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stakes in the companies in its sights were hived off byAnglo into a holding company called Johnnic -- in preparation,Anglo said, for a sale which promoted black economic empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Anglo is angling for a price far beyond the reach of theblack businessmen it seeks to empower. &quot;Anglo American is pushingthe price to a point where it could mean this is not the rightdeal for the National Empowerment Consortium,&quot; an analyst close tothe negotiators said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some players in the negotiations say it appears Anglo Americanis backtracking on the deal. Although it set up Johnnic with theexpress intention of selling it on to promote black economicempowerment, it has shied away from the idea of selling the parcelof assets off at any discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nail chairman Nthato Motlana expressed concern about the pricelast year, but since then it had appeared Anglo was willing tonegotiate downwards. &quot;At first they were in a hurry to push thedeal through. Now it looks as if they are having second thoughts,&quot;a source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A financial analyst at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange said itappeared Anglo had originally trumpeted the Johnnic deal in a bidto &quot;get the heat off them on black economic empowerment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now it appeared Anglo was willing to ditch the deal if it didnot get the market price for Johnnic. It would then split upJohnnic, and the various players in the National EmpowermentConsortium could pick up the pieces separately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many commentators believe this might not be such a bad thing.For although the Johnnic deal has been touted as a pivotal steptowards black economic empowerment by both Nail and AngloAmerican, many analysts and union advisers are unimpressed withthe mixed bag of assets on offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assets include substantial stakes in Anglo American'slisted press companies, Times Media and Omni Media, as well assmaller stakes in South African Breweries, Toyota and Premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main criticism is that, apart from the press companies,Nail will not have anything approaching control of the others inthe portfolio, which is a tiny mirror image of Anglo American -- asprawling conglomerate which has invested in many unrelatedcompanies in all sectors of the economy because exchange controlsbarred it from investing abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The main motivation for the deal is to get some senior blackfaces in South African business quickly. But there is not going tobe much empowerment from it (the deal),&quot; said the JSE analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that if Anglo American were unable to sell offJohnnic as a whole, halted the talks with the consortium and splitup Johnnic, it would allow Nail to snap up Johnnic's press assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would make strategic sense, given that Nail owns theSowetan and New Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other members of the consortium are also known to have theireye</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on particular parts of the Johnnic portfolio. Wiseman Nkuhlu'sWorldwide Africa Investments, which is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also in the consortium, is apparently keen on buying thePremier stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is therefore understandable that a source close to the Nailnegotiating team said: &quot;It is not the end of the world if we don'tget Johnnic. We have lots more up our sleeve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American refused to comment on the Johnnic talks thisweek.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The final two pieces to the Olympic jigsawpuzzle which has been forming since February fell in to place onTuesday when pole vaulter Riaan Botha and modern pentathlete ClaudCloete were named to the team which leaves for Atlanta a week onSunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was surprise in some quarters that the National OlympicCommittee of South Africa (Nocsa) failed to select a secondathletics candidate. Nocsa left open two more places for thissport when the original athletics squad of 23 was announced at theend of April. The truth is, however, that none of the other fournominations on Athletics South Africa's (ASA) list met thestringent selection criteria laid down by the national Olympicbody.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Athletics simply found out what several other sports had learntearlier in the year: meeting the required qualification standardsis not necessarily good enough to book a passage to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha, who was inexplicably left out of the first athleticscontingent, having already cleared the qualifying standard fourtimes during the South African season, gave the selectors nooption but to include him on the team when he cleared a personalbest 5.85m in Lyon last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cloete failed to qualify at two Olympic qualificationcompetitions in Seoul and Rome earlier in the year but his badluck in drawing a belligerent horse for the equestrian round wherehe failed to score any points almost certainly cost him a worldclass score in Seoul. That convinced Nocsa that Cloete was worth awild card nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wild cards are awarded to athletes from developing countrieswho have not qualified in a sport through the normal channels. TheIOC duly obliged at the weekend and Cloete has become the onlyAfrican representative in the modern pentathlon in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically Botha's name was not at the top of ASA's list ofnominations despite the fact that his 5.85m clearance last weekplaces him eighth in the world at the moment and makes him agenuine medal prospect at the Games. Top spot belonged to racewalker Chris Britz who was controversially nominated to theoriginal squad on a &quot;B&quot; standard qualifier, the only athlete to beconsidered on such a standard despite the omission of many &quot;A&quot;standard qualifiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britz was subsequently rejected by Nocsa but a lifeline wasthrown to him and other athletes who were surprisingly omittedlike Botha, javelin thrower Philip Spies, high jumper HestrieStorbeck and hurdler Ferrins Pieterse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa said they would leave two places open until June 18, bywhich time candidates should have registered an &quot;A&quot; qualifier anddemonstrated their fitness, among other conditions. Britz went toGermany and recorded an &quot;A&quot; qualifying time, shattering his ownnational 20km record by more than two minutes to record 1:22:16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Impressive as this time may be in one of South Africanathletics' Cinderella disciplines it is unlikely that it placeshim in the current world top 50. The world ranking lists of June11 are only 30 deep but those of May 27 which are 50 deep show himin a lowly 48th position. While not wanting to detract fromBritz's performance, it is important to put it in perspectiveafter such ludicrous claims have been made on his behalf by ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stating that such a performance would have won the 1993 worldchampionships, placed him second at the Barcelona Games and sixthat last year's world championships is a bit like comparing adownhill marathon course with a tailwind like Boston to the toughand humid Honolulu Marathon. Britz's time was recorded at theEuropean Race Walking Grand Prix in Eisenhuttenstadt, Germany,which, along with Fana in Norway for track walking, is renowned asone of the fastest road circuits around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quite how this performance ranks above Botha's completelydefies logic as does the absence of Spies' name from the list. Hethrew twice over the qualifying distance this year despitethrowing at a stage of his training when he would not normally bethrowing. His best of 81.34m ranks him 17th in the world on lastweek's world rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spies, however, had already resigned himself to the fact thathe wouldn't be on the list after challenging ASA over their aboutturn on his positive doping result last year. While suchconspiracy theories can often be taken with a pinch of salt it hasnot gone unnoticed that Britz is a loyal apparatchik of theTransvaal Amateur Athletic Congress and boasts the likes of ASApresident Leonard Chuene and ASA secretary general Banele Sindani,the two most powerful figures in the sport, as his closecolleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is admirable to promote a discipline like race walking butwhen Olympic places are at stake simple criteria like merit musttake precedence.  In athletics such attributes are relativelysimple to measure and compare provided, of course, that you have abasic understanding of the sport.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - If Preparation is one of the major keys tosuccess -- whether in sport or in battle -- then the South Africanmen's hockey team are on a hiding to nothing for the upcomingOlympic Games in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only have the squad been forced to condense their build-upto the Games because of the late &quot;green light&quot; giving them the go-ahead to compete, but their recent competitive track record ishardly the stuff of inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their last 10 internationals have not produced a single win andtheir lost/drawn ratio stands at 9/1. And they have hardly beenhelped along the way with injuries to key players Wayne Graham(captain and centre half), Alistair Fredericks (centre forward andleading goal-scorer) and Brian Myburgh (rated as one of the topgoal-keepers in world hockey).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In mitigation, though, the opposition during this 10-matchcycle has hardly been weak. Down Under in Cairns and Brisbane forthe recent four-nation tournament, South Africa faced the strengthand class of Australia (who are generally considered gold medalfavourites for Atlanta), India (currently ranked five in theworld) and a New Zealand side more or less on a par with the SouthAfricans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's report card there read: played seven, lost six,drawn one -- with the draw a 2-2 scoreline against New Zealand andone of the losses being a 2-2 result after fulltime against thesame side in a positional play-off, only for South Africa to godown on penalty flicks 5-4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back at home, the South Africans took on a fit Spanish side,who were missing only two of their first-choice players, in athree-match series in Pietermaritzburg. Both teams used theinternationals as part of their final preparation for Atlanta but,once again from a South African point of view, the resultstatistics were not exactly worth framing and hanging up in a Hallof Hockey Fame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite playing some very good hockey in parts, the SouthAfricans appeared fatigued at times and made too many unforcederrors. They lost the three matches 4-1, 2-1 and 6-2. Nationalhockey coach Gavin Featherstone believes one of the major lessonslearnt from this series is that South Africa desperately needs anupgraded domestic league. &quot;We don't have a club system in thiscountry to give our guys constant pressure week in, week out,&quot;Featherstone says, &quot;and hopefully one of the lessons of 1996 willbe that this country urgently needs a national league.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to pool all our top players to play against each otherregularly -- and not just once a year at the inter-provincialtournament. Our players aren't used to playing regular competitivehockey at the level they do in Europe, or at the level they do inAustralasia or in Asia. Only when our top players get this type ofcompetitive level will they develop the discipline to avoid what Iterm the 'lull periods' in team sport. Then they won't go throughthese lapses and lulls where they get punished at internationallevel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While obviously disappointed at the 3-0 whitewash at the handsof the Spanish, Featherstone takes the pragmatic viewpoint: &quot;Afterlosing the third Test to them, we had played 10 internationals in17 days and I think it was a case of a bridge too far. We didn'tplay the Spanish on an equal playing field; we went round theworld, played seven matches and then said, within two days, thatwe could take them on in three Test matches. It proved a littlebit too much for our lads at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But anyone who saw the quality of our play in the first halfof that third Test can see the standard we play at. Occasionallyit does happen that the bottom falls out -- but I think we musttake heart at our result in the second test ... where we lost 2-1... and at the first half of that third Test. We showed that wecan play at this level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think the main thing the boys are learning is that you canhave a lot of the game and yet still lose by three goals becauseyou have to concentrate extra hard on teams who counter-attackwell. There's no doubt in my mind that that is the area I've gotto work on very hard with the players mentally between now andAtlanta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What also has not helped the South African cause was the latego-ahead given for their Olympic Games participation -- and thishas directly led to the condensed period of preparation by thehockey squad since February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Remember we were allowed to go to Atlanta in mid- February,although we qualified in September at the All-Africa Games,&quot;Featherstone says. &quot;So we had a five-month period where we didvery little and weren't allowed to really.  What we've had to do iscondense our physical training. So far, we've done endurancetraining and only now can we get on to our speed and sharpness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Featherstone feels the difference in fitness levels betweenSouth Africa and Spain during their recent series was marked:&quot;There's no doubt that the Spanish showed that they are matchsharp now for the Olympics, whereas we've still got a month to goon that training. And, in fact, our training will actuallycontinue in Atlanta because we had such a late start in goingthere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late start or not, there is very little else that the SouthAfricans could have done in recent months to improve on theirOlympic Games preparation. As Featherstone points out, a briefbreak is vital to rest bruised and overworked bodies after theintensity of playing 10 hockey internationals in under threeweeks. And an extra bonus from this short lay-off period would bethe full return to match fitness of playmakers Wayne Graham andAlistair Fredericks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite all this, it may be that South Africa will still be ona hiding to nothing come Atlanta. But the South African hockeyteam are probably owed one or two favours by Dame Fortune -- andthey could certainly do with that modicum of luck which has notsmiled upon them over the last month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - According to Tusk's Benjy Mudie, there's a&quot;renaissance&quot; happening, something of a &quot;new wave&quot;. He may beright -- either that, or local record execs are just catching upwith their counterparts overseas. At last, the garage band iscommercial again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given an injection of new life by neo-punk, grunge and alterna-rockers like REM, Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Green Day, the genre ofwhite-boy-plays-loud-guitar is flowering globally. Oasis and theirlike have topped the British charts, where once only synth-swathed ditties ruled. The constraints of the mainstream money-makers, obsessed with the lowest common denominator and terrifiedof anything not produced to death, seem to have loosened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And South Africa is surfing that wave too. It may be somethingto do with our national sense of new freedoms, or perhaps it'sjust preparation for the quota system, but it does feel as thoughan awful lot of &quot;local product&quot; has been released in the last fewmonths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Highlights include albums by The Pressure Cookies (okay, mostof them are female) and The Kerels. New work from well-knownfigures such as Tony Cox and Valiant Swart (his first CD, DieMystic Boer) is on the shelves. Bright Blue are back with a three-track EP, Open Your Eyes, and The Usual -- who share Bright Blue'sguitarist-singer Tom Fox -- have a six-track mini-album, Six Songsfrom the Inside, out too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, two new compilation CDs give a reasonably rosypicture of exactly where South African rock'n'roll stands atpresent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Street Level: Bare Essentials is the product of Cape Town'sStreet Level Studio, started by Richard Black and James Stewart.They have recorded The Usual as well as a handful of other CapeTown bands, giving them each a track or two on Bare Essentials toshow what they can do. The featured bands include Psycho- Deli,Black Diamond, The Groove Kings and Woodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that the CD has been released by record giant BMG --who also put their imprimatur on The Usuals' package -- gives hopethat the era of bands languishing in semi-obscurity without big-label support is over. The new lot, with luck, will have careerslonger than those of many of their Eighties' predecessors, forwhom the release of a record was very often swansong instead ofstarting- point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other compilation CD, the Tusk/5FM My Generation, is not --as the title, stolen from The Who circa 1965, might imply -- arepository of retro-rock. The only song on it that seems reallyout of place in 1996 is Duc the Fox's Love or Money. Otherwise,this is pretty much up-to-the-minute, a cross-section of SouthAfrica's newest, freshest talent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of its 17 tracks, notably, came via the Shifty/Tic TicBang nexus, and it is a well-shaped collection that ranges fromthe guitar-lashed constructions of Squeal, Springbok Nude Girls,Sugardrive and Lithium, to the effervescently jivey pop of UrbanCreep and the New-Age yodelling of QCumba Zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several of the bands featured on My Generation are touring thecountry on the Bandslam bill, which hopes to do for us whatLollapalooza did for the USA.  Perhaps it will be a further step inthe direction of white South African musicians, at last, making aliving from original music. At the very least, the concerts shouldhelp sell some CDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, beyond all this big-hype activity, the newreleases keep coming. The aforementioned Valiant Swart CD isenjoyably barbed blues-rock; KwaZulu-Natalian Syd Kitchenimpresses with his jazzified City Child; and Joe Silva takes anunusual tack with Journeys into Coincidence, a selection of laid-back numbers, a bit like Ry Cooder in lazy- soundtrack mode, whichcan only help one feel meditative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And then there's Jonathan Handley. The King Rat, pretending tobe The Glee Club, continues his South African Gothic saga withpart two, Transvaal Gothic (the first was Free State Gothic). Thewhole is a massive cycle of 33 songs, revolving around thepicaresque story of a sometime windmill salesman.  Maybe onedoesn't need all 33 songs to get the picture, but none are merethrowaways, and many are as good as anything of that ilk ever madein this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Handley is still, scandalously, on cassette only.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - In a report dated 22 April, the &quot;Gazette&quot; has received accounts of surprise attacks by a joint force of the Misiriya Arab &quot;murahaleen&quot; and the Popular Defence Forces (PDF) of the Khartoum regime upon the Dinka communities in the Abyei and Northern Gogrial areas.  These areas had been peaceful since 1991 owing to a peace accord signed by the Misiriya Arabs with the Ngok and Twic Dinka.  It now transpires that the National Islamic Front(NIF) regime offered the Misiriya Arabs all manner of inducements to break that peace accord and finally, in February, it succeeded in that objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The joint force launched its attack on 29 February along the River Kiir.  The operation lasted until 3 March, by which time several Dinka villages had been ransacked and burnt down. They are: Malwal, Rumbek, Nguet, Micar, Atong, Majok Alieu and Lang. Cattle was looted and crops were destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This past year had seen a bountiful harvest and the Dinka were confident that they would not need any additional relief aid. It is believed that the Dinka's move towards self sufficiency provoked Khartoum into attacking at this time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 10 March, a further military force launched a second attack on other villages in the area, destroying Malual Alieu, Dier, Gongmabil, Rumnyien, Kokwei, Mabil Anyiuel and Kol Kuot. This force was reinforced by units of the regular army stationed at Abyei. On 29 March, the attackers returned to the area in even greater numbers. The attack was co-ordinated with the Nuer tribal militia from Bentiu. That militia had instructions to prevent any Dinka cattle from using the common grazing land, so that no Dinka cattle or property escaped the looters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudan People's Liberation Army's (SPLA) civilian commissioner for Abyei, James Ajing Path, has produced a detailed report of the attacks. In the attack of 29 March, more than forty civilians were killed, thirty of them named in the report; more than one hundred women and children were captured and sold into slavery, including twenty-nine identified by the name in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slave Market. A slave trading and exchange camp was set up outside Abyei. Women were offered for their sexual services and as domestic slaves to Arabs who had not been involved in the attacks. The Dinka themselves were allowed to buy back their relatives at the rate of five cows per person or the equivalent in cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the third attack, large numbers of Dinka moved further South into Bahr El Ghazal and have sought refuge around the relief centre at Mayen Abun in the Twic Dinka area of Northern Gogrial. They are now at the mercy of the providers of relief aid. The areas is part of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) but because it is in territory disputed by the SPLA and the NIF regime, the relief flights are infrequent and often cancelled at a whim by the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all the Dinka made homeless by the attacks have managed to reach Mayen Abun. Reports suggest that many thousands are hiding out along the River Kiir, afraid that the marauders will return to capture them or finish them off. Those that have arrived are already suffering from food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr James Ajing Path has appealed to the international relief community to quickly come to the aid of this newly displaced population. The displaced people are quite capable of organising themselves to plant crops in the area during the rainy season, if they are given the seeds and tools with which to do it. The planting season in this area is quite flexible and crops could be sworn as late as June and July. Obviously, the people will need relief supplies to last until the crops can be harvested. These people are keen to become self sufficient once more, having lost everything in the three raids.  As many as 100,000 people have been displaced by the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workable Airstrips. There are a number of workable airstrips in the area that could be used for bringing in emergency relief supplies. Apart from Mayen Abun itself, there is the airstrip at Akak to the West, and airstrips at Turalei and Maper to the East. OLS has used all four airstrips in the past. There are a further two airstrips to the North of Mayen Abun at Ajak Kwac and Agok. These last two airstrips are closest to the area of devastation and lie in a very fertile agricultural area which could be used for planting crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Demand for Self Defence. There are many loud voices now within the Dinka communities, particularly in Northern Bahr El Ghazal but also elsewhere, who are calling for the SPLA to help the tribe set up and arm home guards to defend themselves against the Arabs and other tribal militias that seem to attack them with impunity. The SPLA has rightly resisted these calls.  However, in the absence of any other alternative for the security of this tribe- so targeted for genocide by the NIF regime- the case for the tribe to arm itself to resist the regime's machinations is quite strong. That is, unless the SPLA finds itself with the resources and facilities to station a protective force in the border areas of Northern Bahr El Ghazal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When in 1987-88 the government in Khartoum unleashed Arab and other tribal militias against the Dinka communities in the border areas, there was also a call to the SPLA to train and arm home guards. The reasons for resisting these calls for arms to the tribes were valid at that time and they remain so today. Perhaps the SPLA should consider placing its guerrilla units in these border areas to give the tribes there the confidence they need for their security and protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where Is the SPLA? Whilst all the devastation and destruction took place, the forces of the SPLA were nowhere to be seen. This raises the obvious question as to why this was the case. Perhaps the SPLA believed that the peace accord between the Arabs and the Dinka was the best guarantor of security in the area. Even if that was not the case, the SPLA would need a huge military force to protect the area from the hit and run raids of the militia forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NIF regime's plan is a simple one. If it can keep the tribes in the border areas fighting one another, then it can redirect its own war resources away from this area to other battle fronts in the South, the Nuba Mountains and now Eastern Sudan. It is not clear what SPLA forces may have been in the area because there was also the problem further South inside Bahr El Ghazal of the militia force of the renegade commander Kerubino Kuanyin Bol at Gogrial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA has in the past been reluctant to engage in wholesale attacks on tribal militias, as it is a force fighting for national liberation from the NIF regime. However, the SPLA cannot ignore the security of the local population in these areas forever, because it ultimately needs their support.  These communities are being attacked because they are perceived by the NIF to be supporters of the SPLA. They would not be under such severe pressure if they accepted Khartoum's overlordship. It must be hoped that the SPLA will recognise that these communities do need proper protection before the regime succeeds in convincing the people that the SPLA has abandoned them. The SPLA will not be able to maintain the loyalty of these groups unless it does something to alleviate their suffering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The National Empowerment Consortium, which is heading the bid for a stake in Times Media Limited's owner, Johnnic, has trashed the idea of an editorial charter as long as it remains a pre-condition of sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyril Ramaphosa, who is soon to be executive deputy chairman of New Africa Investments Limited (Nail), snubbed TML management by rejecting its idea for an editorial charter which was presented to him for his seal of approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The editors have publicly declared the charter as a means of &quot;preserving age-old traditions and editorial integrity&quot; and with this they tried to seduce Ramaphosa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he acknowledged that editorial independence was important, Ramaphosa indicated a polite thanks, but no thanks. Sources close to Ramaphosa say both the owners and editors of TML presented the idea of an editorial charter as part of the transaction, but that Ramaphosa would not budge on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is understood that Ramaphosa is perplexed by the fact that the charter is a matter of urgency for TML with prospective new owners, but it was not -- and still remains -- a non-issue with the editors during the course of their current dealings with Johnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a source, it emerged during the course of discussion between Ramaphosa and the editors that an immediate endorsement by Ramaphosa for the charter would smooth ongoing negotiations on the unbundling of Johnnic considerably, especially since a hard bargain is being driven by Johnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa remains unconvinced by this and will continue to withhold his consent on the charter, insiders say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Ramaphosa expresses support for editorial independence, the urgency for a charter suggested an uneasiness on the part of TML at the prospect of black owners. TML managing director Roy Paulson says the charter was drawn up and handed to Anglo American, but he has no knowledge of whether it was handed over to Ramaphosa. In fact, the idea has been conveyed to Ramaphosa on several occasions during the ongoing talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To some media observers, the &quot;chickens have come home to roost for TML&quot;.  An insider, privy to negotiations between TML and New Nation two years ago, says TML management belittled the idea of an editorial charter when New Nation requested one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the source, Paulson attempted to ensure that TML would have had editorial control over and above a New Nation editorial charter, under instruction from executives at Omni Media and Johnnic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's ironic that when they were negotiating they agreed to an editorial charter as long as they still maintained editorial control. For the publicity's sake, they even offered us 51% of the deal but they wanted to hold the reins. Now the time for TML has come, they are shaking in their boots and are pushing for a charter in desperation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paulson rejected these claims, saying that although he did approach New Nation, TML's intentions were honourable. &quot;It's totally untrue that we offered New Nation a stake in the company. TML went in to buy the company and it would have been wholly owned by us,&quot; Paulson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We respected their editorial independence and even had no problems with them supporting the African National Congress as long as it did not impinge on the commercial viability of the publication,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Nation editor Gabu Tugwana confirmed there was a &quot;problem&quot; which resulted in a breakdown in talks but refused to divulge details.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Independent Newspapers' magazine Sunday Life may be sued by Time Warner, proprietor of the Life trademark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bob Scherer of the Trademark Council, a division of Time Warner in the United States, says talks are under way with Independent Newspapers' management, and although talk of a lawsuit may be &quot;a bit premature&quot;, the issue is &quot;far from resolved&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Law firm Adams &amp; Adams, representing Time Warner, may have a conflict of interest since the firm also represents Independent Newspapers. Because of this conflict, Adams &amp; Adams may have to abandon representing Time Warner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source at the firm says Time Warner has not yet instituted proceedings, and Independent Newspapers must meet certain conditions in a bid to settle out of court. &quot;It's difficult to prove trademark infringement and the matter may have to be negotiated further,&quot; an insider said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another adds that the issue at stake is whether or not the original trademark was copied and the defendant has to prove that it was not; alternatively, the plaintiff has to prove that it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talks between the two parties have been ongoing for the past year.  Sunday Life editor Les Aupiais says, as far as she knows, it was agreed Sunday Life will abide by certain conditions. These are that the magazine will not be sold as a stand-alone with a cover price, the name will not be printed in white on a red background as in the original Life magazine and that it will always have the prefix &quot;Sunday&quot; before &quot;Life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The magazine will always be a supplement to the main body newspaper,&quot; says Aupiais, adding that the typeface of the magazine was also specially designed for the magazine and is nothing like that of the original Life trademark. &quot;The typeface of Sunday is Firmin Didot and Life is in Doric. It was not copied from the original Life magazine,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Managing director of Cape Newspapers Rory Wilson told the Mail &amp; Guardian that Time Warner approached the stable some months ago where they stated their case. &quot;We then took counsel's opinion on the matter and we are not infringing any trademark. We are holding by that,&quot; Wilson says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Newspapers' sales and marketing manager Greg Brophy confirms that legal counsel was sought. He says Sunday Life are two generic words which do not infringe on the trademark of Life magazine. &quot;We have pumped lots of money into the marketing of Sunday Life and before that was done we ensured that we were on solid ground in terms of ethics and legal aspects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive director of the Association of Marketeers Derek Dickens says trademarks and brands are what the free market is all about and well-known trademarks, for this reason, have to be protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dickens, the Trademarks Act in South Africa is &quot;a lot more lax&quot; than in other countries. However, it is adequate to protect local and international brands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of Sunday Life and Time Warner boils down to whether Sunday Life was registered under the old Trademarks Act, which allowed for South Africans to register trademarks as long as they were not well- known locally, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early Nineties, with the formation of the European Economic Council, there was an international effort to harmonise all trademark laws across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an effort to keep in line with international trends, South Africa brought its own old-fashioned trademarks act into line with world standards.  Now, with the old act repealed, the new Act insists that a trademark can only be registered once a worldwide search of brands is conducted by the applicant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;America has put pressure on South Africans who harbour trademarks under the old Act. We have to get in line and respect international trademarks and make sure they are protected in this country as we risk losing favoured nation status,&quot; Dickens says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A case in point is the international McDonalds versus Macdonalds, says Dickens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Section 34.2 of the new Trademarks Act states that the rights of a trademark will be infringed if there is an unauthorised identical or similar mark in the form of shape, colour or name, that so nearly resembles another trademark that it is likely to be perceived as such or cause confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dicken argues that Time Warner in all probability has a strong case unless Independent Newspapers registered its Sunday Life logo under the old Act. He says the stable's counsel will then have to prove that the two brands cannot be confused. but with the new act in place, the newspaper house will have to get in line.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Investors should not be put off shares just because the Johannesburg Stock Exchange has taken a beating thanks to the rand's tumble.  Rather, now is a good time to buy, says Schalk Theron, senior portfolio manager of Sanlam Unit Trusts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The average annual after-tax return on shares over 20 years far exceeds that of other investments, so investors should take a long-term view and consider the softening of the JSE as a buying opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be silly for a regular monthly investor to discontinue buying, because one can get more units for the same amount.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shares are by their very nature volatile. But investors should not judge unit trust performance over periods of less than three years, says Theron.  &quot;Chasing returns over shorter periods becomes too risky for prudent portfolio management,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, gold funds would have yielded a 30% return in the last quarter - but over a five-year term, that would have translated into 10%, as against the 25% return an industrial trust would have yielded at a much lower level of risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the fundamentals continue to look good. &quot;I do not think the share market is overvalued. I am bullish about prospects for growth,&quot; says Theron.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Labour Market Commission has sharply criticised South Africa's obsession with huge capital-intensive projects rather than more labour-intensive projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African manufacturing was dominated &quot;to an unusual degree&quot; by highly capital-intensive sectors such as commodity chemicals, electricity generation and non-ferrous metals. Even services and agriculture were capital intensive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, there was significant under- investment in sectors such as clothing, footwear, furniture and tourism, with very little participation by small- to medium-sized firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's high capital intensity was, in part, due to the emergence of large and powerful public and private sector conglomerates that &quot;have become deeply locked into our economic structure and will resist policy interventions that attempt to transform it&quot;. These had developed because of sanctions and the need to ensure self-sufficiency, while gaining access to secure sources of foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new government had an entirely different set of priorities and concerns, not least job creation for the large pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour and the better use of capital and skilled labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This did not imply that government should not support large projects now being planned, but &quot;every effort&quot; should be made to ensure that as many upstream and downstream jobs as possible were created at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current focus on development corridors clearly represents an attempt to generate sustainable employment clustered around infrastructural development and is welcomed,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move to create more jobs should be accompanied by specific policy measures aimed at dealing with the &quot;notoriously weak competition policy&quot;, state purchasing that favoured large firms, export incentives biased against small firms and inadequate training for small business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission warned, however, that &quot;the labour market cannot, and should not, be expected to bear the full brunt of the adjustment alone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as industries continued to benefit from subsidised electricity and finance, labour would continue to be a relatively costly input, which could lead to demands for wage cuts in return for employing more people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission said these factors appeared to be recognised in government's present approach to industrial policy, but it expressed concern that it was not focused enough on the efficient and effective use of scarce capital resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It urged that the Industrial Development Corporation be forced to refocus its activities. It recognised that this &quot;may be akin to turning a supertanker&quot;, but said it should focus more on job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A disproportionate share of its resources is devoted to very large highly capital-intensive projects, generally in partnership with a predictable array of well-resourced corporations,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key to any attempt to move towards labour-intensive policies would be concerted efforts to improve productivity and link that to wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In fact, as the South African economy becomes more open to international competition, firms will only be able to survive if their costs and productivity are comparable to those of their major international competitors,&quot; the commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission said there was no clear evidence that South African wages were out of sync with the rest of the world, but there was no room for complacency. Productivity had to be improved through the introduction of training programmes, multi-shift systems and the development of new products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big business could at the same time encourage the development of small and medium enterprises by sub- contracting out work. Unions have been somewhat uneasy with the idea, fearing that sub- contractors might be exploited at the expense of workers, but the commission warned against unions trying to ban sub-contracting and business against promoting the proliferation of sweatshops.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Government has delivered its long-awaited economic strategy. Developed by an impressive team of economists, it adheres to established economic principles and promotes fiscal discipline. Yet markets remain unimpressed. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main reason is slow growth and inadequate employment creation.  Economic growth in the integrated scenario projection remains below 4% through 1998. In the very uncertain &quot;out-years&quot; of 1999 and 2000, the model shows more impressive growth of 4,9 and 6,1% respectively. Employment growth only averages 2,9% through 2000. This does not adequately address South Africa's principal problem: unemployment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The growth that is envisaged is driven primarily by private sector investment and exports. Government investment actually drags economic growth down in 1996 and 1997 because its growth is lower than the gross domestic product (GDP) growth. In the &quot;out- years&quot;, government investment rises inexplicably from 7,5% in 1999 to 16,7% in 2000 to provide an average growth rate for the 1996 to 2000 period of 7,1%. Perhaps Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) investment will surge in 2000, but RDP spending is no engine of growth for the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Export sector growth depends to a great extent on preserving the shift in relative prices brought about by rand depreciation. This requires a vigilant stance against inflation. Both tight monetary policy and incomes policy can be used here. One hopes there will be greater reliance on the latter, permitting lower real interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real bank rate is seen to fall by four percentage points between 1996 and 1999. But sour management-labour relations could undermine incomes policy and lead to excessive monetary restraint. This would strangle the domestic sector in favour of exporters. Another concern is the response of exporters to wider profit margins. Will they expand output or reap higher profits? Much depends on expectations of relative competitiveness. More efficient production is needed. Lower tariffs should help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The model shows real wages rising in spite of chronic unemployment. Yet there is talk of more flexible labour markets. Clearly, there is need for elaboration on how more flexible labour markets will come about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, there is much reliance on private sector investment to drive growth, with private investment growing by about 9% annually until 1999 and then jumping to even higher rates thereafter. But there is no consensus that private investment will grow at these levels. Financial markets have not responded with enthusiasm to the government's vision -- evidence that for all the rhetoric about fiscal discipline, what investors really want is growth, earnings and high rates of return. Since the government appears intent on waiting several more years before investing in South Africa, many domestic and foreign investors may decide to do the same.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A controversial study suggests South Africa's unemployment rate is not the highest in the world and averages 20% against the 32% quoted by most experts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Labour Organisation (ILO) study recognises that unemployment is a problem, but is not the Sword of Damocles that has sent various government departments and unions scurrying around for solutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ILO report rejects notions that South Africa suffers from &quot;structural unemployment&quot; as hazy and elastic and slams the figures produced by the most widely quoted October Household Survey as &quot;distorted and an exaggeration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is hesitant about giving its own estimate on unemployment, but claims &quot;one would not be far wrong in 'guesstimating' an unemployment rate of about 20%. Such a level is serious, but well short of the figure of 32% cited by politicians, economists and the media.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Few politicians mention the &quot;f-word&quot; anymore -- it has been replaced by the &quot;c-words&quot; which are more and more characterising the ANC's approach to governing South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;f-word&quot; -- federalism -- was deliberately dropped during constitutional debate earlier this year, so that parties could move away from time-worn arguments and develop a new system of government based on the golden principles of co-operation, consultation and compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Co-operative government&quot; is a term that can be sourced in debates about federalism and describes a system where provincial governments co-operate with one another for the common good, rather than compete against each other for individual gain. In the New South African sense it is embodied in the new Council of Provinces (COP), which will replace the Senate, and in the Intergovernmental Forum which is a forum for provincial and national executives, as well as in Minmec forums, which are meetings of national and provincial line-function ministers and MECs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is thrilled with this model, partly because it was a way of side-stepping a head-on argument over federalism and centralism -- but also because it is a pleasant and positive notion which decreases the chances of messy conflict and stand- offs between the central and provincial governments. Further, it complements the African principle of ubuntu, which describes a feeling of the worth of the community, a shared brotherhood of men and women and a sense of working for the common good. It is hoped that the model will be implemented before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party supports the model of &quot;co-operative government&quot; and the principle of provincial co-operation enthusiastically, and does not believe that the accumulation of ANC interests in the COP will drown out the opposition voice of an NP-led Western Cape or an Inkatha-led Kwazulu-Natal.  Both the ANC and the NP believe that the co- operative model is a healthy step away from Westminster type opposition politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha, however, is wary of the new set-up because it equates ANC co-operation with co-option. IFP hardliner Walter Felgate wastes no words: &quot;Co-operative government is a shot-gun marriage between the provinces and central government&quot;. That is, &quot;co- operation&quot; will allow for easier, painless majority rule, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC sources indicate that the model of co-operation was born partly with Inkatha-led Kwazulu-Natal in mind, in order to contain that province's waywardness and to build it into a system which allows provincial integrity on the one hand, but curtails maverick provincial impulses born from a desire to pursue competitive federalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential adviser Professor Fink Haysom warns against competitive federalism, saying it could lead to an enormous waste of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the competitive system, each province competes against every other province and too much political energy goes into securing the little good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haysom believes that competitive government could well lead to grave instability within the country and economic weakness nationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly Haysom and the ANC have a valid point, and the pursuit of co-operation among all interest groups, large and small, is a welcome contrast to the previous era, where the needs of a tiny sector of the population were foisted on everybody else without attempts to reach consensus. The result was the destructive skewing of resources for which South Africans will pay for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the ANC use of the word &quot;co-operation&quot; has an Orwellian resonance to it, especially if it is to become an end in itself, or is coupled to internal political agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate around a new education system is an interesting example. It reveals that there is an articulated desire for co- operation on a highly sensitive issue, but that the ANC-led government is determined to push through its agenda, in spite of consultation, while using the co-operative forums to bind critical voices into the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Co-operation&quot; could become, at crunch-time, a thinly veiled majoritarianism which masquerades as the common good, but in fact represents ANC interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fights about what is the common good are expected to escalate when the government implements national norms and standards in areas such as health, education and welfare. In terms of the constitution, the central government can overrule provincial objections when implementing national norms and standards, and effectively can make the co-operative COP a lesser partner in its decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political scientist Professor Willie Breytenbach says that the jury is still out as to whether or not the ANC is going to use &quot;co-operation&quot; to bulldoze through its political will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it is interesting that Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen -- once the ANC's sweetheart -- is concerned about the extent to which the ANC is prepared to listen to differences of opinion and then ignore them, especially in the field of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the basis of that experience, and the experience of negotiating for volkstaat agreements for over two years, he gives this advice to members of the public who have to negotiate with the ANC on matters of difference: &quot;Certainly, talk, consult with the ANC, but be very careful because you must never underestimate the enemy, you must never underestimate the ANC, or the intellectual part of the ANC which is the SACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You must have a clear idea of what you want to do, in line with international law, and you must stick to your point, otherwise you are on thin ice ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Viljoen said that minority parties could be sucked into a whirlpool of &quot;co-operation&quot; in which their interests could be drowned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC intellectual and SACP member MP Pravin Gordhan hits back at that point of view: &quot;The smaller parties' fear of co-operation is a search for leverage to defend, protect, enhance minority party concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's not conflict we want, it's co-operation; it's not debilitating disagreement we want, it's optimal consensus; it's not unilateralism we want , it's multilateralism. We don't want individuals to be empowered to stand in the way of the collective, we want a collective in which the individual can find a means of expression.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There is a mystery over the government takeover of the Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust (ZMMT), the nominally independent body which is the majority shareholder in Zimpapers, the country's only national newspaper chain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month the Mail &amp; Guardian reported on the government's move following a brief statement by director of information Bornwell Chakaodza, carried as a front-page news item in Zimpapers' flagship weekly, the Sunday Mail. Chakaodza announced that the trust's founding deed of 1981 had been amended in April following a cabinet decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After that no further explanations were given for the government's abrupt reversal of a key plank in its post- independence media policy -- a change with profound implications for the state's role in the determination of editorial and management policy of the dominant national press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointedly, journalists and editors working for Zimpapers and Ziana, the government news agency, did not pursue the subject, after having spent years proclaiming the sanctity of the ZMMT's independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they had gone after the story they probably would not have got far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Chakaodza's policy bombshell, ZMMT officials have been quiet, deflecting requests for copies of the amendments. Chakaodza's information ministry has also been evasive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Searches for the director's initial press statement, still the only source of official comment on the matter, have come up empty- handed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And still no copies of the deed changes. A check at the Deeds Registry office in Harare last week perhaps explains why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to registry officials no changes to the original 1981 ZMMT Deed have in fact been registered. Which means that the original 1981 trust deed is still legally in effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the deed amendments have not been registered, one wonders where they are, why it has taken so long to put them into operation -- and why the Director of Information announced that the changes had been made on April 29?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, if there has been an error of fact by either government or the media which carried Chakaodza's announcement, why was it not later corrected by the ZMMT, government or by the ZMMT's own media?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six weeks after the announcement of government's clampdown on the national press structures these questions remain unanswered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lack of clarity has led to further speculation. Last year, Honour Mkushi, the liberal-minded lawyer selected by trustees in 1995 as ZMMT chairman against the wishes of the information ministry, spoke of the ZMMT's new struggles to carve out an independent path just as government was twisting the ZMMT's arm to accept the state's control over the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trust doesn't want to operate on the basis of being tied at the end of a string that can be pulled by the Ministry of Information and government,&quot; Mkushi said. &quot;If I was asked to wind up the trust on political grounds, I -- and several other trustees, I think -- would prefer to fight for survival on the grounds of protecting the principle of the trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Dramatic new details about the mysterious death of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1975 emerged last week during a war crimes trial in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial, which is considering evidence of alleged atrocities committed during the country's communist period from 1974 to 1991, was told that Selassie, who ruled Ethiopia for more than 50 years, was driven away from his palace on September 12, 1974, in a Volkswagen Beetle -- never to be seen in public again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first public account of the emperor's death came from two attendants who stayed with him in custody. They were brought in to see his body on the morning of August 26, 1975.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a smell of ether in the air,&quot; one witness said. &quot;And his majesty was not lying in his usual position. He only had one pillow. The shawl that he wrapped himself in when he went to sleep was lying in another part of the room. His face was ghastly and there was a bandage around his neck.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The witness described how he had been with the emperor until 9pm the previous evening, when soldiers came to take him away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;His majesty came from his bed and when he saw what was happening tears came to his eyes and he cried out: 'Is it not true, Ethiopia, that I have strived for you?' He fell on his knees and prayed. Later I realised that these were his last words to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third witness described how Colonel Haile Mariam Mengistu, who had assumed leadership of Ethiopia's military council, the Dergue, ordered a number of graves to be dug in the grounds of the Grand Palace -- where the military's headquarters were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emperor, he said, was buried under Mengistu's office window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was worried he would kill me,&quot; the gravedigger told the court, &quot;but he lit a cigarette for me and told me to fence the area. I did it in 15 minutes while he watched from the window. Then he ordered me to construct a building on the site. I did it in two weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty-six members of the Dergue are in the dock, with some former leaders -- including Mengistu, who fled to Zimbabwe -- being tried in their absence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Zimbabwe's national award ceremony for journalists, an annual beanfeast which for the past six years has presented solid trophies and real prize money for independent, unfrightened journalists, is probably no more, following this year's occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Journalists and Media Awards (NJAMA) is an institution where the praise singers of Zimbabwe's press are, for one day of the year, ignored, and reporters who write what is in front of their noses are rewarded for doing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nation where the daily newspapers, radio and television are owned by President Robert Mugabe's government and receive their instructions from the seldom-swept offices of the ministry of information in central Harare, NJAMA has been an inspiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, a pair of journalists received due recognition as news reporters of the year for catching most of the ruling Zanu-PF party politburo parcelling out former white-owned farms to each other. This year the first prize was for a series of reports exposing ruling party officials trying to purloin the tender for the country's first cellular telephone network.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second prize was for breaching the bounds of the presidential bedroom and identifying Mugabe's new wife, whom he married clandestinely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this year's ceremony was blighted by folly from which it may prove impossible for the organiser, the Willie Musarurwa Memorial Trust, to recover. One after the other, sponsors on whose support the ceremony is dependent, have announced their withdrawal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a critical misjudgment to hold the affair in the hall of the Zanu-PF headquarters, a vast and dingy auditorium the size of a rugby field whose parquet flooring obviously has not tasted polish in the decade of its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bar at the Zanu-PF headquarters was run by someone's relative who runs a bottle store 30km outside town. It was a revealing indication of the headquarter's usual clientele. It cost Zim $5 deposit for a glass for each drink, and it was a nightmare trying to get the money back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of the ceremony, Kindness Paradza, the president of the Zimbabwean Union of Journalists (ZUJ), was urging members of his union to boycott the awards because, he said, the electronic media, which consists entirely of the state-owned Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), were not represented in the awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZBC had let the organisers know in March that it was withdrawing its participation because of the way its journalists had been &quot;lampooned&quot; at the awards last year, but also because one of the judges was Jeremy Brickhill, a private television producer who is suing the ZBC for a large amount of money for non- payment of fees. ZBC journalists affirm they were instructed by their management not to have anything to do with NJAMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZUJ had already expressed concern that the venue, chosen because the organisers got it &quot;dirt cheap&quot;, might prejudice the impartiality of potential participants, 90% of whom comprised the ZBC, Zimpapers, the national newspaper chain and the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency (ZIANA), the domestic news agency, all of whom fall under the financial and editorial direction of Zanu-PF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZUJ was a member of the organising committee which had been meeting twice a month since November last year, although its representative made only sporadic appearances. The first the committee heard of ZUJ's withdrawal was in the columns of the daily newspapers on the day of the awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ZUJ's boycott pretty well worked. The collection of tables in the southern section of the hall was already dwarfed by the immensity of the auditorium, and the effect was enhanced by the occupation of only about half of the seating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recipients of awards had been advised, however, that failure to attend the ceremony would deprive them of their award and of the prize money (R1000 for first place, R500 for second and R250 for third). The only person not to turn up for his award failed to do so because he was injured in a car crash.  It could not be established whether he forfeited his prize money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guest speaker for the occasion was Deon du Plessis, managing director of Gauteng Newspapers, whose huge bodyguard drew appreciative murmurs as he ferried many large brandies and coke to his employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Du Plessis's speech, stating that South African newspapers have &quot;a good news obligation&quot; under the new government, went down like a stone with those in the audience who had anything to do with the late Willie Masururwa, the patron of the trust and former editor of the Sunday Mail, Zimbabwe's biggest selling newspaper. Msururwa had repeatedly warned his staff of the dangers of &quot;sunshine journalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The massacres of civilians in the western provinces of Matabeleland by Mugabe's 5th Brigade, corruption, Zanu-PF's peculiar support for the PAC instead of the ANC, and its &quot;leadership code&quot; of austerity that everyone ignored were issues that Musarurwa could not close his eyes to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musarurwa was sacked on Mugabe's orders in 1985. Maybe, in his time, he would have survived had he listened to the likes of Du Plessis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The ailing Angolan president is turning his back on his own party, reports the latest edition of Africa Confidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jose Eduardo dos Santos's recent sacking of Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and his cabinet was a belated attempt to rally his troops before they have to start doing business with Jonas Savimbi's political cadres in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The merging of government and rebel armies is meant to be finished within three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Angolans are sceptical; Dos Santos is widely seen as heading a weak, divided and discredited party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fernando Franca Van-Dunem, whom Dos Santos has chosen to revitalise the government, does not stand out as a beacon of reforming zeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Dos Santos himself seems seriously weak. Diplomats in Luanda have been trying to discover just what is wrong with him. Since he was treated at a private clinic in France in April, he has rarely been seen in public and has received few visitors at the Futungo de Belas palace. There are rumours circulating that he has prostate cancer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is uncertainty everywhere, especially around the peace process.  The Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola (Unita) has tentatively begun to move its troops into quarters, but its commitment to peace remains highly ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the ruling Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA)) is on the brink of collapse. In 1992 Dos Santos campaigned on his own merits, aided by a slick Brazilian-run advertising campaign, and since then put a distance between himself and the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos relies heavily for advice on a small group of friends and family. The United States has invested a great deal in its relationship with the president. An important channel has been former assistant secretary of state Herman Cohen, whose consulting company has worked closely with the Dos Santos government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos has recently failed to give a consistent political lead at home or abroad; to many he appears more interested in his private affairs than in running the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats fear that Dos Santos may reject the advice of the poster at Luanda airport proclaiming &quot;Angola no coracao (Angola in the heart)&quot; and might leave for Brazil and a wealthy retirement. Ill-health and his growing fear of plots have made the presidency tougher than ever. But senior MPLA officials work hard to keep him going. They fear bloodletting in the party if he quits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MPLA is regularly attacked from inside. Lucio Lara, the former secretary general, recently called the party &quot;old and tired&quot;. It has not held a congress since 1991 and the central committee decided in February to postpone the next congress to 1997. The apparatchiks do not want to draw attention to the division, corruption and weakness of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a year after Bicesse Accords, in May 1991, the MPLA failed to meet the challenge of Unita, which lost the multi-party elections of September 1992 mainly because of Jonas Savimbi's threatening campaign, rather than the MPLA's merits. The MPLA was stimulated to pull itself together by Unita's rejection of electoral defeat and its return to armed struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before the Lusaka Protocol in 1994, the government army, Forcas Armadas Angolanas (FAA), clearly had the military advantage over Unita forces. But this is not the same thing as the MPLA having the military advantage. FAA officers such as General Joao de Matos have shown open contempt for the party. De Matos himself never joined the MPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MPLA of old started dissolving in the run-up to the 1992 elections.  when many members started moving their families out of Angola and got as much money out as they could. That process has never been reversed and the party has not been renewed. Now MPLA officials seem intent on pursuing their private interests and leaving the growing urban poor in the hands of United Nations agencies and foreign non- governmental organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State power is supposed to be concentrated and co- ordinated in the Council of Ministers. In practice ministers look after their own ministries and governors after their provinces. Strategic decisions are made mainly by the president's Futungo palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Futungo overrules cabinet frequently. For example, in September 1995 it stopped the issue of new banknotes by Finance Minister Augustino Tomas. There is almost no talk of post-war reconstruction. Futungo's longest perspective is the two-monthly renewal of the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rulers' main energies go into their own business affairs. Minister of Agriculture Isaac dos Anjos recently got a bank loan to set up a fruit factory in which he is the shareholder-owner. He told the press that he had to look after his own interests first. There are more than 70 foreign security firms in Luanda, protecting senior people's interests. Meanwhile teachers are paid about $3 per month; a bottle of beer costs $1. The foreign- exchange value of the Kwanza fell by 3,608% in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government announced in May that it is planning measures to ease the crisis. After the reshuffle, it is rumoured there will be pay increases for state employees. Without sound public finances, that can only spur inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crime is pervasive. The authorities have banned several demonstrations, broadcasting warnings on the radio and stationing rapid-intervention police (the infamous &quot;Ninjas&quot;) to deter would- be demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government cannot really trust the active army and the regular police, some of whose senior officers sympathise with the discontented civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government tries to hold the loyalty of senior serving officers by allocating profitable enterprises to them. The MPLA hopes this will increase its influence, because they need party patronage if they are to make profits.  But some officers have set up on their own accounts. In Lunda Norte, at Calonda, a diamond concession is run by Tricorn, which is linked to Chief of Staff Joao de Matos and other officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita, too, is becoming a business alliance. Of Angola's total output of diamonds, estimated by Western intelligence reports to be worth up to $690- million, Unita mined and smuggled out $430- million in 1995. The alluvial diamonds of Lunda Norte are almost worked out. In 1996 Unita brought in equipment and skilled staff from South Africa to work the Cuango riverbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi and his Unita associates may even be worried by Dos Santos's reported illness. They do not respect the president, but regard him as a stabilising influence. The government's senior officers and the MPLA's cadres envy Unita's hold on diamond-rich areas. Business could bring the rivals together -- or in the unrest that would follow Dos Santos's departure, set them at each others' throats again.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When new legislation liberalising South Africa's abortion laws reaches Parliament, much will depend on whether African National Congress MPs vote en bloc or according to their consciences. While the debate has yet to rage in the ANC caucus, MPs are already under pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC policy has been unequivocally in favour of women's right to safe, legal abortions -- and usual practice is for caucus to guide voting on related legislation. But Christian and Muslim MPs and others who oppose abortion on moral grounds face a dilemma -- spelt out in a document circulating among MPs which urges the ANC to oppose an open vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It carries the name of deputy president Thabo Mbeki's adviser, Reverend Frank Chikane, and is a position paper issued by the Research Institute on Christianity in South Africa at the University of Cape Town's Department of Religious Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Co-authored by Professor John de Gruchy and Reverend Barney Pityana, the paper, entitled The Dilemma of Some Christian MPs and the proposed abortion policy, does not argue for or against abortion, but for the right of MPs to dissent on party policy on religious or moral grounds, while remaining loyal party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They argue that because MPs cannot cross the floor to another party without losing their seats, coupled to the fact they are not elected by constituencies, an open vote is necessary on religious or moral principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many members of the ANC honestly believe the pro- abortion policy which has been proposed is an expression of the commitment to gender rights and equality (and) also regard it as the best way to deal with a highly complex moral and medical issue,&quot; they write. &quot;But there are also those who disagree on the basis of a different interpretation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question of abortion is a particularly difficult one for maintaining party discipline because it is on the boundary between what the ANC might expect from its members who support its stand on gender issues and yet who, on religious or moral grounds, cannot support legalised abortion or the proposed legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There can be no doubt that the rights of women cannot be denied or voted against by ANC representatives; there can also be no doubt that Roman Catholics as well as believers of some other traditions cannot vote for abortion without denying their faith and its moral demands. They want to support gender equality and rights, but not in this way. So in all conscience, they are duty bound to dissent. It is precisely on such boundary issues that an open vote becomes necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allowing a free vote would be &quot;a clear sign that the ANC recognises the higher loyalty which people of all faiths acknowledge&quot;. &quot;Instead of alienating sections of the population which are generally supportive of ANC policy, they will strengthen their commitment to the party,&quot; the paper says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MPs facing this dilemma find it compounded by the fact their votes become part of the public record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said a Muslim ANC MP: &quot;We have already been denounced by religious leaders for not speaking out against abortion during constitutional negotiations. We are members of the ANC and the country is governed by a Constitution guaranteeing women's equality, but ultimately we are bound by the Qu'ran.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response, the Reproductive Rights Alliance has urged the ANC to reaffirm its position on abortion. &quot;The fact that abortion is a moral issue should not mean the ANC need feel obliged to abandon party discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As things stand, the African Christian Democratic Party is opposed to liberalising abortion laws. So is the National Party, which will use the whip to ensure its members toe the party line in voting against the new bill -- unless sufficient NP women supporters who feel differently can make their voices heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party will allow its MPs to vote according to their consciences. After a debate in the Inkatha Freedom Party parliamentary caucus last year, IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi allowed MPs to do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are different views within the IFP and they are irreconcilable,&quot; said an MP. &quot;The one is that abortion is a crime, the other that it's a crime that women can't have them. But it seems the majority of caucus is opposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The big question is which way the ANC will jump.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Draft legislation liberalising the country's abortion law was due before a cabinet committee on May 29. But health minister Nkosazana Zuma withdrew it at the last minute, fuelling suspicions that political considerations -- not the least pending KwaZulu-Natal local government elections -- has seen it pushed to the backburner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian established this week that the draft Termination of Pregnancy Bill was submitted by the department of health drafters on May 22 and scheduled to go before the Cabinet Committee on Social Affairs and Administration on May 29. The matter was left in abeyance at the request of the minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Department of health legal section head Sello Ramasala said this week he was not aware of any problems with the bill -- ruling out the possibility of it being withdrawn for technical reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speculation is now focused on whether the political sensitivity of the legislation -- which provides for abortion on request -- is not the issue.  There was also concern this week that the delay would prevent the bill from being introduced to parliament before it rises at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuma said she did not want to discuss Cabinet issues with the press. &quot;On principle, members of Cabinet do not go to the press on Cabinet issues until approval has been reached, because it is a collective,&quot; said director general Dr Olive Shisana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I recall we in the department had not worked out the financial implications and had to do that on the Cabinet memo to be sure the minister was properly advised in terms of the implications of the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The department did not withdraw the Cabinet memo. But the routine is that if there are financial implications it's required to consult the Department of State Expenditure. That could not be done because while the provinces said they had the money, we had to have it in writing -- we couldn't rely on verbal consultations,&quot; said Shisana. &quot;We felt it was important to take that step.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was &quot;no way&quot; she could give dates when the Bill would come before Cabinet. The ball is rolling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indications are that the African National Congress is wary about floating the issue ahead of the KwaZulu-Natal elections for fear it will become a political football. The Inkatha Freedom Party is also divided on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would appear to me the matter is deliberately being put on the backburner until after the KwaZulu- Natal elections,&quot; said IFP MP Suzanne Vos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also speculation that Zuma -- who strongly backs abortion reform -- may be less than keen on engaging in a hefty political battle so soon after the Sarafina 2 debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for health care providers the issue is critical. Hospitals are battling to cope with the demand for legal terminations in terms of the existing law and they have to plan to provide the infrastructure and training necessary to cope with demand once the law is changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The judicial process has also been affected: in some magisterial districts, cases involving medical practitioners charged with providing illegal abortions have been stayed pending changes in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Marj Dyer, president of the Abortion Reform Action Group, said she was receiving up to four calls a day from women &quot;across the spectrum of population groups, income level and religious affiliation&quot; seeking terminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hospitals are not coping with the demand for legal terminations under the current law. The new bill, if passed, would provide for women to be treated at primary and secondary health-care facilities -- taking the strain off the major hospitals and giving women more equal access to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Western Cape, a provincial task group has been set up to deal with problems being encountered in implementing the existing law. &quot;There's this sense of limbo because we don't know what's happening with the legislation. There is a need for government to take a lead and say these are the services we will need to provide,&quot; said a task group source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Groote Schuur Hospital (GSH), one of three hospitals allowed to carry out legal terminations, handles the majority of cases and cannot meet the demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Head of GSH's obstetrics and gynaecological department Professor JB Dommisse has said in an internal Medical Association of South Africa newsletter that the high demand was a result of many women thinking abortion on demand was available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Limited resources and other demands on the department forced GSH to put in place two years ago a quota system limiting the number of women who can be given legal terminations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this quota system is giving rise to its own problems. Gynaecological and out-patients' department staff find themselves subjected to harassment from referring doctors and patients when told the quota is full.  Women, told they can't be seen in a given week, try again and again, creating a bottleneck which sees women presenting at more advanced stages of pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A GSH representative said: &quot;The bottleneck phenomenon is a logical consequence of any quota system where demand exceeds the ability of resources to cope.&quot; Women who could not be seen were referred back to their doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They can go to a private hospital -- which would exclude, on grounds of cost, the majority of women, or another state hospital licensed to do terminations. However, the increase in demand at GSH is understood to reflect the difficulty women have in getting terminations at the only other hospitals licensed to do them, Tygerberg and Somerset Hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, implementing the abortion law is costing the country millions of rands a year and effectively sentencing women who resort to backstreet abortionists to illness, sterility or death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent study, the Medical Research Council estimated that 44 686 women a year, ranging in age from 14 to 49, presented to hospitals with incomplete abortions. The vast majority (84%) were African women, followed by coloured (11%), Asian (4%) and white (1%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During 1994, 2 180 legal abortions were performed - -- 61,3% on white women from the urban middle class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study found that 425 women each year could die in hospital from septic abortions, that each year countrywide 6 961 women were &quot;moderately sick&quot; and 5 886 &quot;very ill&quot; after abortions usually carried out on the backstreets. The total costs of treating incomplete abortion cases in one year was R18,6- million. This amount could fund more than 88 000 safe abortions using existing technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The health costs and consequences of unsafe abortion to South African women are a serious public health issue,&quot; said Michelle O'Sullivan of the Reproductive Rights Alliance, a network of organisations formed to lobby for and promote comprehensive reproductive health care services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party is likely to win most rural areas, and the African National Congress is poised to win the powerful Durban metropolis and Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu- Natal's long-awaited local government elections next Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result will merely entrench the two parties' strongholds, keeping the province politically divided into mainly rural and urban constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both parties, however, are hoping for more. The ANC is pushing for victory in at least one of the province's seven over-arching regional councils, and several of the main towns and cities dotting the countryside, while the IFP wants to capture at least one of the six sub-structures comprising the Durban metro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is pushing hardest for the urbanised Midlands Regional Council, which stretches from Kranskop in the north to East Griqualand in the south, Pietermaritzburg in the east and Impendle in the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC won roughly 49% of the region's votes in 1994. The IFP came second with 35%. Comprising 20 municipalities, the region forms part of the powerful Durban-Pietermaritzburg corridor --Ethe centre of commercial activity in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also comprising important rural constituencies, the battle for control of this region has been the fiercest, marked notably by several violent confrontations, particularly in rural Donnybrook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP's push to make Ulundi the provincial capital, the ANC's uncontested victory in strife- torn Richmond, and a concentration of ANC strongholds in many of the region's townships, have made the IFP's fight for the region far more difficult than in the six remaining regional councils, where it held a clear victory in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The province's complicated rural local government formula --Ea transitional arrangement making chiefs automatic rural local &quot;councillors&quot; and reserving them 20% of seats on the second-tier regional councils --Ehowever, makes victory an uphill battle for the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the party has launched a legal challenge to the formula, the reservation of seats for mainly IFP-aligned chiefs -- Etogether with the 10% reserved for mainly conservative white farmers or &quot;levy payers&quot; --Emean only 70% of regional council seats will be elected from rural party lists and municipal councils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC would have to win at least 70% of elected seats to gain a simple 50% majority on a regional council. It could easily win the majority of votes and still lose control of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the province's 61 towns and cities, the application of the Kempton Park horse-trading deal known as the &quot;50-50&quot; arrangement --Ewhere small white constituencies in the town centres will elect the same number of councillors as populous black townships on the towns' outskirts --Ewill be decisive in towns where the ANC wins the most votes but falls short of an absolute council majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most complicated voting formula -- Eespecially for first-time municipal voters -- Eis that for the Durban metro. The metro's 1,1-million voters will cast three ballots each to determine the winner: one for a councillor in one of 164 wards, one from a party list for one of six sub-councils, and one from a separate party list for the metropolitan council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC was the biggest party in the metro area in 1994 with approximately 41% of the votes, followed by the National Party (31%) and the IFP (21%).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A massive area comprising nearly one-third of the province's voters, and controlling a R3,6-billion budget, the Durban metro will be the prize of this election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP is pushing hard to prevent this, relying partly on the 50-50 deal which divides the wards equally between former white, Indian and coloured areas on the one hand, and traditionally African areas (townships) on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Known as &quot;A-wards&quot; and &quot;B-wards&quot; respectively, these are not strict racial classifications but are rather based on former Group Areas Act divisions. The IFP hopes to benefit from the inclusion of mushrooming informal settlements into some A-wards and participation in joint development forums with these settlements' &quot;minority&quot; neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP gained significant support from Durban's white voters in 1994 and has made a push for Indian supporters in this election. The party hopes its recent work will boost the 5% Indian vote it received in 1994 and deliver a victory in the largely Indian northern substructure or &quot;suburb&quot; (comprising Tongaat and Verulam), where it is contesting 16 of the 18 wards --Ealbeit with many of its Indian candidates declining to put the party logo next to their name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An IFP victory in this substructure would deliver a psychological blow to the ANC --Erepresenting not only an IFP advance into its metro stronghold, but also marginalising the ANC's hard-won Hambanathi stronghold within the sub-structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hambanathi was the site of intense violence in the early 1980s, at the start of the province's civil war. Nevertheless, the ANC is expected to emerge with the highest number of metropolitan votes, the only question being one of percentages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the party falls short of an absolute majority of seats, it may find its power usurped by a hostile coalition. Most of the 53 000 new Metro voters registered during the one-month delay the party demanded in April are believed to be ANC supporters and the party has worked non-stop to mobilise its constituencies since the delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The metro's black townships are largely ANC-aligned, although they contain significant IFP strongholds. The minority A-wards which hold the balance of power are mainly Indian-dominated and the ANC gained about 25% of the community's vote in 1994 --Esecond to the National Party's 60% majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the ANC's Indian support-base derives mainly from middle- class Natal Indian Congress supporters, its local government candidates have campaigned vigorously in the working class neighbourhoods of Chatsworth and Pheonix, where its civic structures -- such as the Pheonix Working Committee -- have fought long battles over local issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Competition for the metro's significant Indian and marginal coloured votes is the most intense -- Ewith canvassers from the NP, ANC, IFP, Minority Front, Democratic Party and a host of independent groups practically stumbling over one another as they beat a path to the next house.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The marathon murder trial of Eugene de Kock entered its final stages this week with a blistering prosecution attack on the former Vlakplaas commander's lawyers for drawing out proceedings with &quot;irrelevant&quot; cross-examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutor Anton Ackerman, deputy Transvaal attorney general, made the charge in a lengthy submission as the 16-month-old trial resumed in the Pretoria Supreme Court on Wednesday for final argument. De Kock's defence team has already cost taxpayers more than R4-million, about half in fees for chief defence counsel Flip Hattingh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late last month Hattingh accused Ackerman of &quot;serious misconduct&quot; for meeting De Kock, who is charged on 121 counts of murder, fraud and unlawful weapons possession, in January at the Pretoria Central Prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hattingh, who said he should have been consulted about the meeting, threatened to ask for a mistrial and reported Ackerman to the Pretoria Bar Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Ackerman at no stage said Hattingh acted outside his rights in his style of cross-examination, he argued Hattingh had often dwelt, sometimes for weeks, on &quot;collateral&quot; aspects when cross-examining state witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman said Hattingh attempted &quot;from the outset&quot; to discredit state witnesses, often on extraneous factors such as Vlakplaas informant Ben van Zyl's &quot;extra-marital affair&quot;, or allegations of Chappies Klopper's relations with prostitutes. He said the state did not regard Klopper -- witness &quot;Q&quot; who first told the Goldstone Commission about Vlakplaas crimes -- as a key witness. &quot;Hundreds of pages&quot; of cross-examination had been spent on Klopper's own background and on the 1985 departmental hearing of state witness and former Vlakplaas commander Dirk Coetzee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman said it was common for witnesses to differ on minor apects, but that Hattingh had spent much time teasing out the expected. &quot;This is exactly what happened in this case ... while it was never stated what the accused will maintain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the defence had taken a new tack in September last year -- where previously it appeared to have believed De Kock could be cleared of the charges, Hattingh then tried in cross-examination to show that De Kock had merely followed orders from &quot;the generals&quot;. (Significantly, this was when De Kock's confidant Willie Nortje started his testimony against his former commander, and when police commissioner George Fivaz first said police were considering withdrawing state funding of the defence.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman also accused Hattingh of &quot;a conscious attempt&quot; to discredit Transvaal attorney general Jan D'Oliveira's investigation team by saying, for example, that &quot;the defence was bugged where it met with the accused&quot;. But after objections from Hattingh, Judge Willem van der Merwe told Ackerman he could not pursue the argument without specific reference to what Hattingh had said in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ackerman also outlined what he called the former security police &quot;modus operandi&quot;. He said &quot;people who wanted to make revelations over police irregularities were to be killed&quot;, and that this was confirmed by, for example, the cassette player bomb sent to Coetzee. The bomb killed lawyer Bheki Mlangeni -- his death is one of the murders of which De Kock is accused.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Former senior members of the ANC Women's League (ANCWL) have raised questions about the impartiality of the auditor who compiled the report on the league's finances, as the row over financial mismanagement in the league escalated in Parliament this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, such is the fear and loathing between various sectors of the league that suspicions are not stated openly, and the audit report has remained sizzling in the fat of secrecy all week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was revealed at the weekend that the auditors, commissioned by the ANC, had discovered &quot;serious discrepancies&quot; in the spending of about R7,8-million by the ANCWL during a period when ANC stalwarts Adelaide Tambo and Makhosazana Njobe were treasurers, and Baleka Kgotsisile, now deputy speaker of Parliament, was its secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The audit, by Hardman and Associates, was commissioned by ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa after fights about power and finances within the league last year, which have not yet been resolved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Ramaphosa appointed the auditors, Winnie Madizikela- Mandela is said to have suggested which firm be employed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeff Manning, senior partner of Hardman and Associates, said weekend media reports &quot;had got it all wrong&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 99% of the almost 7,8-million could be accounted for and the report did not apportion blame to anyone in the ANCWL. Manning added that Tambo was &quot;not a financial whizz-kid&quot; and most of the problems were due to a lack of proper controls and systems and to the inexperience of junior officials, not to misappropriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody could be accused of fraud on the basis of the report,&quot; he said.  &quot;I've recommended that Mrs Tambo and Mrs Madizikela- Mandela sit down together and go through all the transactions and decide which ones should be accepted and which ones not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has said it would call such a meeting that would include Ramaphosa and ANC treasurer general Reverend Arnold Stofile to help to sort out the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manning said he had also discovered that last year's fall-out in the ANCWL, which led to the walk-out by nine executive members including Tambo and Kgotsisile and the resurrection of Madizikela- Mandela as unchallenged president, had been over nothing at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recommendations of the auditor -- which appear to be of a political nature -- have not gone down well with those who walked out last year, and who fear he wrote the audit from a particular perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC has spent R91 000 on an assault on our integrity,&quot; growled one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unnamed former executive members say the auditor had not questioned key role-players such as Tambo and Njobe about alleged irregularities and say they are suspicious that the audit took more than six months to complete at a cost of R91 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to add to the saga, the so-called Winnie camp -- current league executive members -- say they are equally distressed the report was leaked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They refuse to comment until the league's national executive meets to discuss the report. These members believe this debacle is &quot;slowing their progress&quot; in the empowerment of women. Asked if the league should perhaps disband, executive member Maureen Malumise replied: &quot;Absolutely not, we are very strong on the ground. The league is bringing women together over women's issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members point out the league sets up workshops on subjects such as reproductive rights, land rights, equality and empowerment, is driving a programme of action inherited from the Beijing Women's Conference and has led a campaign about abused women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet women MPs from outside the league are asking under their breath whether the league, with its power-play and its set agenda, is serving any real purpose in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Male ANC MPs who entertain the same question say they are frightened to raise the issue lest they get branded as sexist, so the questions remain buried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official line is defensive. ANC MP Carl Niehaus answered questions about the ANCWL's role by saying: &quot;It's not what they've done, it's what they have the potential to achieve.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And league members, past and present, are wary of what they see as male plots, speculating the audit report was leaked by male MPs to disempower women within the organisation, and to undermine the league after its outspoken criticism of the Sarafina II affair and its support for beleaguered Deputy Enviroment Minister Bantu Holomisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some see criticism of the league as a strategy to unseat Madizikela-Mandela from her last throne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niehaus said the ANC is waiting for additional information on the finances before proceeding with the meeting. This contradicts Manning, who says he has closed his books on the league for good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Telkom's plans to set itself up as an Internet service provider (ISP) have prompted the Internet Service Providers' Association (ISPA) to take the parastatal to the Competitions Board. The ISPA believes Telkom is using its uniquely privileged position to squeeze existing ISPs out of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Telkom's monopoly on telephone lines and other communications infrastructure, ISPs are forced to become clients of the South African Internet Exchange (SAIX), a division of Telkom. In the case of the larger service providers, this costs in the region of R1-million a month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the ISPs believe Telkom is undermining them by marketing itself direct to the public and to corporate clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ISPs are legally obliged to buy all communications services from Telkom,&quot; says David Frankel, joint chair of ISPA. &quot;This includes artificially expensive international circuits to communicate with the United States. If ISP were allowed to bypass Telkom using international carriers directly out of South Africa, our prices to end users could be reduced dramatically.  Telkom is abusing its monopoly and profitability in this area to undercut existing ISPs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As service providers have to work through Telkom when connecting a new client to the Internet -- a process which can take up to eight weeks for Telkom to install a digital line -- there are concerns that SAIX will be at an unfair advantage when it comes to linking up new customers, since Telkom will be able to give first priority to SAIX clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ISPA fears that Telkom's entry into the service provision market could bring an end to the healthy competition in the industry which has so far seen a boom in Internet service provision in South Africa. Frankel has received hundreds of letters from existing or prospective clients who acknowledge that subscribing to SAIX will be far more competitive than remaining with the existing ISPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with Intelligence magazine, Telkom's strategy and business development executive Blackie Lahoud claimed Telkom was not guilty of unfair competition, but &quot;we're doing what Telcos around the world are doing -- adding value to our services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frankel points out this is an invalid comparison, given the absence of competition or regulation to keep a check on Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom's Internet product manager Rikus Mattyser said in an interview with Sapa this week that SAIX is not a service provider, and that the existing ISPs are its only clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet publicity material put out by Telkom clearly expresses an intention to become a service provider dealing direct with the public. &quot;Will Telkom provide Internet services? YES!&quot; proclaims one brochure. It goes on to detail the advantages of Internet access to the business user, and declares &quot;Telkom's SAIX service makes it easier than ever to access the Internet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approached for further comment, Telkom representative Zandile Mxaku said the matter was now before the Competitions Board, and the corporation could not respond to media enquiries at this stage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Next month, the South African Communist Party celebrates 75 years of struggle for the socialist transformation of South Africa, as the oldest communist party on the continent. But this week, comrades were asking what had happened to the socialist agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unease in party ranks over the direction the economy is taking was ratcheted up by the SACP Central Committee's support for the objective of the macro- economic framework announced by government last week -- a package that also had business applauding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Comrades are uncomfortable,&quot; said a source. &quot;With the documents inhaled by business as it was, there must be something wrong for the SACP to have reacted as it did.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its statement, the Central Committee said it &quot;fully backed&quot; the objectives of the package, noting it was designed as a vehicle to achieve Reconstruction and Development Programme goals, that the role of the public sector would be expanded and the labour market would be regulated, rather than left to market forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the policy has been criticised by left-wing economists for giving business most of the benefits and relying on the private sector to turn them into growth, job creation and wealth redistribution. It has been compared with the normative economic model unveiled by the National Party in the last days of its rule -- which focused on export-led growth, fiscal conservatism and tight economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In some quarters of the SACP, the framework's commitment to increased social spending and other aspects are seen as mere sops to the working class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP and party official Phillip Dexter dismissed suggestions the party was backing a right turn by government, saying the new economic paradigm was forged during negotiations in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're not saying there are not weaknesses in the framework -- but it's unfair to say government has adopted a Thatcherite vision,&quot; said Dexter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reliance on foreign and domestic private sector investment -- without any suggestion of how this would be levered -- was of personal concern to him, Dexter said. &quot;But that's not to say the document failed miserably.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's only rider in its response to the framework was to say it intended &quot;taking forward discussion, elaboration and debate&quot; on the strategy and that &quot;questions of detail and implementation require ongoing scrutiny&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party sources said this week the SACP and its alliance partner, Cosatu, had been consulted &quot;very late&quot; over the package. There were suggestions political pressure had been applied and that the party had buckled to it -- as it needed the ANC more as an alliance partner than the ANC needed it. Why else, asked one, would the party be &quot;running cover&quot; for the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SACP deputy secretary general Jeremy Cronin said consultation was late, &quot;but thorough&quot;. The government's argument that the area had been bedevilled by speculation and so had to be kept under wraps had been appreciated, he said. &quot;We are not just running cover for the ANC and government. We have been calling for the past two years for a clear macro-economic framework and for government to take the lead. This has been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;crunch issue&quot; was that the framework opted for a very tight budget restructuring to reduce the deficit by 1% in one year, Cronin said. &quot;We're not sure this is the right route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are good arguments for reducing the deficit -- it creates breathing space and the country won't be pushed into a debt trap -- but it's founded on the hope that business will come to the ball. Our concern and scepticism centre on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clear framework meant that within a year or two there could be an assessment of what should have happened but hadn't. Cronin denied any political pressure had been applied on the party to temper its response.  &quot;There were honest discussions within the alliance about the framework and the reasons for it. Wisdom informed us that a certain degree of support is important. There were no pressures on us, and they would not work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there had been a call &quot;for a level-headed appreciation for what government is trying to do&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He conceded the left's failure to come up with an alternative model -- Cosatu's social equity document does not address macro- economic policy -- reflected weaknesses, such as a lack of technical capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unease in party ranks was more a problem for the ANC-led government.  &quot;The critical thing is to open the debate and discuss hard choices and prevent the tendency of bureaucrats to do things quietly in the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A meeting of the Central Committee in two weeks' time could see sparks.  &quot;Labour and the broad left within the party are going to be very critical,&quot; said a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But a key question is whether we as a working class movement have been able to create pressure for these issues to be engaged from a working class point of view. We must all take responsibility for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Peace has become the buzzword on KwaZulu-Natal's campaign trails as more than 14 political parties and a host of independent candidates and ratepayers' bodies mark the final countdown to Wednesday's polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior political leaders, national ministers and several provincial premiers have descended on the province in recent weeks hoping to bolster their parties' showing among the province's 3,5- million registered voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major provincial parties ranked peace at the top of their election biddings, amid signs that the recent African National Congress-Inkatha Freedom Party peace effort has taken the steam out of the third- ranked National Party's strategy to portray itself as the peaceful alternative to two warring African parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blue posters bearing NP leader FW de Klerk's &quot;NP for Peace&quot; message lost their impact when ANC President Nelson Mandela, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi declared the 13-year civil war &quot;over&quot; at weekend rallies around the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While national politicians competed broadly for the kudos of the recent peace pact and pumped national issues at traditional rallies and public meetings, the diverse political styles of the parties emerged from the campaigns waged by their provincial and local counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the penultimate campaign weekend, the IFP airdropped hundreds of thousands of party pamphlets over &quot;no-go&quot; areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC concentrated its energies on a revival of its once- powerful mobilisation tool: the street meeting. Addressing dozens of small neighbourhood gatherings in &quot;minority&quot; areas, party candidates reminded voters of their recent civic campaign successes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP had a quiet weekend, with its campaign set for take-off only this week, but grabbed local headlines by plastering trees along the main highway into Indian-dominated Chatsworth with stark red posters promising to &quot;Hang the killers, hang the rapists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaigns of two of the smaller parties -- the Democratic Party and Pan Africanist Congress -- juxtaposed their distant philosophies in classic style: while PAC candidates armed with megaphones drove postered bakkies around the crowded Warick Triangle African market area, a dozen DP supporters waged a telephone campaign from a small office in central Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minority Front leader Amichand Rajbansi augmented his public meeting campaign with a strategic poster drive: three faces of the &quot;Bengal Tiger&quot; mark the centre of one overpass on the N3 into Durban between alternate rows of ANC and IFP posters symbolising the MF leader's &quot;neutral&quot; self-portrait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If posters were the sole determinant of election results, the ANC and MF would have a clear lead in the powerful Durban metropolitan area. The poll is, however, about far more than posters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haunted by claims of 1994 electoral fraud, suffering under a divided and lethargic provincial government, and seriously flirting with a full-scale ceasefire, KwaZulu-Natal's second post- apartheid poll is set to define the balance of power more precisely than ever before.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There are a number of things about Philip Powell that confirm the media's representation of him as a warlord senator. He is fond of wearing olive-green military trousers and a baseball cap with the logo of Inkatha's paramilitary protection units above the peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His turbo-charged bakkie echoes a scene from Somalia as it speeds through a burnt-out part of a township in the Natal Midlands with men in the back carrying shotguns and automatic rifles. He calls David Ntombela, a dreaded Inkatha strongman, his spiritual father. And in his book case at home in Howick, there is a book entitled How to Make War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it comes as a relief when this amiable and articulate man opens a trunk in the van -- which African National Congress people will swear to you is frequently packed with M-26 hand grenades -- to reveal camping equipment and boxes of canned food.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These, he says, are more useful than guns when you are on an election trail, trying to build the grassroots structures of a political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Powell describes himself as an Inkatha Freedom Party populist, forced in the turbulent wars of the 1980s and early 1990s to dirty his hands in paramilitary work, but now dedicated to what he calls the democratisation of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is some evidence, at least in Powell's case, to back the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has attended 36 election rallies, some in the most remote areas of the province, in the past four weeks. And he has delivered the same speech at most of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is based on the cliche of a cake that will be divided up in next week's local government elections. But it draws skilfully on the culture and the material conditions of the rural people who inhabit his power base in the Midlands of KwaZulu- Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White people have grown fat on the cake, he tells a rally to launch a new branch at Mahobeni village in the Vulindlela district, and they don't want to give it up. Coloureds and Indians got a few small slices in the apartheid era. ANC people in the townships got some of the crumbs --and they don't really want to share them. The poor rural communities, whose mothers still cut wood in the forest and whose sisters collect water from the river in buckets, still have nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where are the schools and the clinics and the roads that the ANC has promised? Where is the electricity and the taps? ... You must elect people who will fight for the cake. You must elect people who, when the fat white man doesn't want to give it up, will not lie down and say 'Ja Baas',&quot; he tells the applauding crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most of all you must not elect someone who will eat the cake. You do not want to see the person you vote for next year driving around in a big car with a wife who washes her dishes under a tap while you are still walking to river to fetch water.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speech is littered with irony -- and licence. It ignores the fact that Ntombela, chairman of this Inkatha district and provincial parliamentarian, drove to this very meeting in a white Mercedes, and that Mrs Ntombela washes dishes under hot running water while most wives in her village carry buckets on their heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Powell forgets to mention that it is the IFP government in the province that is responsible for building schools and roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But his imagery strikes a chord in the poorest of the province's poor.  His ability to tune into his constituency's culture is demonstrated by the ripple of laughter that runs through the men's ranks when he ends by shouting: &quot;And most of all, comrades, you must remember that this election is all about ... the keke!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His last word is a play on Zulu slang for what can be seen as the sweetest part of a woman's body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the rally, Powell is in a more serious mood. He insists that to understand Inkatha and its &quot;old militarism&quot; it is necessary to understand both the culture and the wretched material conditions of its class base in the 1980s -- the rural peasantry and the urban impoverished urban strata who live in the province's impoverished villages and shantytowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shacklords and warlords emerged in these areas as a reaction to the attacks carried out in the 1980s by ANC youth on older people and chiefs in defiance of Zulu culture's veneration of authority -- and militaristic forms of punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chiefs and their supporters mobilised in the best way they knew: by calling their indunas and forming amabutho to discipline the boys who had initiated what &quot;to the chiefs was almost a pogrom against them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1960s and 1970s, says Powell, Inkatha was a movement led by the &quot;amakholwa&quot;, a mission-trained Zulu elite made up of genteel men like Ben Ngubane, Frank Mdlalose, Oscar Dhlomo and Sibusiso Bhengu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1980s, because it was the only organisation sympathetic to plight of the traditional chiefs, Inkatha's power base shifted. Warlords like Ntombela emerged as a &quot;spontaneous&quot; bulwark against an ANC- inspired rejection of the values that Zulu elders stood for. The militaristic mood and tactics of the movement's new rank- and-file spread from below, rather than from the movement's leadership, he maintains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Powell is adamant that the IFP is now moving into what he calls its third &quot;institutional phase&quot;, forgoing armed methods in favour of building an efficient electoral machinery and democratic party structures. The party, pushed by its chief strategist Ziba Jiyane, is exhausted by war. It now wants to concentrate on mobilising its natural constituency, the urban and rural poor, by exploiting the ANC's failure to deliver on the Reconstruction and Development Programme. And this is best achieved, he points out, by civil methods of organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't like to use military metaphors,&quot; says Powell (although they still come naturally to him). &quot;But we see these local government elections as a live firing exercise for the big one in 1999.&quot; If this is true -- and the analysis is presented with sophistication and apparent sincerity -- then it can only mean good for those parts of the province reduced to near-ruin by warlordism and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are aspects of the senator's past that make this sound rather strange. In the 1980s, Powell worked in the D Section of police intelligence, where he did a masters thesis on the tactics of the mass democratic movement in the Eastern Cape. He won't admit this, but it is likely his work fed into the clandestine project used by the police against the ANC in the region at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then there is his &quot;father-son&quot; relationship with Ntombela, a man whose hands are deeply steeped in the blood of the province's conflict. &quot;Ntombela came to see me when I was in hospital after being wounded in a shoot-out in 1992,&quot; says Powell. &quot;I heard him tell my father, who was still alive at the time, in Zulu, that he would have to share being my father. Since then he has been my deepest source of inspiration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Father Tim Smith, a Roman Catholic priest who was hounded out of Ntombela's Elandskop stronghold, says Ntombela murdered his own brother after an argument, in front of witnesses, on Christmas Day 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntombela's impis, probably assisted by trainees from Inkatha's notorious Caprivi unit, led an attack by thousands of Inkatha warriors on ANC-held sections of the Edendale valley in March 1990. They killed about 50 people and caused some 14 000 to flee. The warlord's apparent immunity from prosecution at the time led him once to say of a witness, in front of a magistrate, &quot;What does that man want here? I can shoot him even here in court.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eugene de Kock, the police colonel who has promised to give evidence in a number of &quot;third force&quot; trials, says he personally delivered truckloads of automatic rifles, ammunition and hand grenades to Powell when the Inkatha activist was in charge of training the IFP's self protection units (SPUs) at a camp near the Umfolozi Game Reserve in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Powell says he cannot comment on De Kock's charges because he will possibly be involved in a criminal trial over the matter. But he insists the SPUs were set up to defend against attacks from the ANC's self-defence units, that no weapons were issued during the training he supervised, and that police authorities were fully informed about the activities in his training camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest peace agreement between warlords on both sides, he says, &quot;comes from the people who are directly involved in the violence and that's why it's more important than anything else in ensuring that the peace holds&quot;.  The fighters are tired of fighting, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are signs that Powell is personally tired of the warlord senator role -- or of being perceived in that way. His wife, the daughter of parents who were classified coloured in the apartheid period, is pregnant with their first child. And the senator is clearly concerned, if only for their sake, that he should &quot;stay out of the clutches of the like of (Police Minister) Sydney Mufamadi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I suppose I'm enough of a student of Leninism,&quot; he says in response to questions about his martial image, &quot;to know that different stages of struggle call for a different political strategies. We have now realised it to would be futile for us to challenge the ANC in any other way than institutionally.  We have committed ourselves to an institutional struggle and will persevere however hard it is for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maybe one day, while he was on the road to one of the province's many war zones, Philip Powell did undergo a genuine conversion. If that means there is a genuine effort to implement his articulate notion of a new &quot;phase of institutional politics&quot;, it may just be the senator will have to keep baked beans instead of bullets in the back of his bakkie for good.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It started in February last year as South Africa's first &quot;third force&quot; trial, austere in emotion and staggering in consequence. But this week, with 16 months of legal battle drawing to a close, Pretoria Supreme Court Judge Willem van der Merwe allowed the courtroom an occasional moment of light relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gone were the charged opening scenes when an incredulous South Africa followed the participants' every utterance; when Eugene de Kock's former Vlakplaas subordinates packed the public gallery in a show of support; when De Kock himself may still have hoped against hope that there was a way out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now many of De Kock's own men have testified against their former commander. De Kock himelf has admitted, in another trial where he testified for the prosecution, that it was &quot;accurate&quot; to describe him as &quot;South Africa's most effective assassin&quot; and that he expected a lengthy sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Kock seemed relaxed on Wednesday as the trial resumed for final argument, sometimes taking notes, sometimes watching impassively, a pen in his mouth, as prosecutor Anton Ackerman argued. After the day's proceedings he chatted warmly with wild- bearded Dougie Holtzhausen, one of the men who had turned against him. Holtzhausen was the only member of the Vlakplaas gang to have followed the entire day's proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Judge Van der Merwe stole the show, often engaging in lengthy dialogue with Ackerman, expounding philosophically on the difference between &quot;your truth, my truth and the truth&quot; -- and asking a member of the attorney general's office to &quot;stamp on&quot; his cellphone when its ringing interrupted proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Ackerman referred to Holtzhausen's testimony, the judge cautioned: &quot;You must be careful that he (Holtzhausen) does not throw stones at you from the back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was on the subject of state witness Chappes Klopper -- whom the defence had tried to discredit with stories of prostitutes, drugs, gold chains and more -- that Judge Van der Merwe had the most to say. &quot;If you look at what the (other) state witnesses said, it looks like he missed Sunday school reasonably often.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a judge remains a judge, and that means extraneous factors shouldn't cloud judgment. Said Judge Van der Merwe of Klopper: &quot;He is not the type of character that I would want to stroll with on a Sunday afternoon in a park, but that doesn't mean I should reject his evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1996 Nigeria track and field events to choose the country's athletes for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the United States, ended Saturday in Lagos. Some 20,000 spectators watched the finals at the National Stadium in Sururele, a Lagos neighbourhood, with the 100 metre race for men and women as major highlights. African track queen Mary Onyali-Omagbemi beat all comers in the women's 100-metre race, finishing in 10.67 seconds. She also won gold in the women's 200-metre race. Davidson Ezinwa, nother United States-based sprinter, won the men's 100-metre dash with a time of 9.86 seconds. But the times are subject to confirmation because officials said they were manually recorded. Two of Nigeria's four athletes, Chioma Ajunwa and Clement Chukwu, made impressive comeback after serving their four-year ban by the International Athletics Federation. Chioma came second behind Onyali-Omagemi in the 100-metre women's race and picked up the gold in the long jump. Chukwu, on the other hand, placed third in the 400 metres behind policeman Sunday Bada and Jude Monye who placed first and second in the explosive race. Two other returnees Charity Okpara and Innocent Asonze were not as lucky. -0United States and Africa</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar, Senegal - The plight of Africa's deprived children, commemorated June 16 as the Day of the African Child, was of interest to the Ethiopian Herald daily newspaper, published in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that observing children's rights, such as theirs to education, was &quot;an important component&quot; of the convention on the Rights of the African child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It noted that many events of national or international days of significance were observed in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has never been lack of vowing for commitments by governments to meet the objectives of alleviating this or that festering social and political problem,&quot; it said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it continued, &quot;Not much of the resolutions or commitments aspiring for lofty ideals are taken heed of after (they are) marked. That is, statements of the resolutions often appear overambitious and sometimes even impractical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, it said, &quot;genuine and purposeful activities, no matter how small the magnitude may be, are more helpful than repetitions of verbal commitments and declarations for achieving overambitious objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar's Sud Quotidien, a Senegalese daily, commented on the effort by Tanzania's first president, Julius Nyerere, to call a meeting aimed at bringing political stability to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting took place with many members of the main politcal parties but without Hutu militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It noted that Burundi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo, who did not take part in the conference but who met later with Nyerere, never reprimanded his army for any troubles in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it wondered rhetorically, &quot;How can citizens have confidence in their army if it fails to be representative of all sectors of the country?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, the paper turned to the bid by the United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to seek a second term this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It noted that the Egyptian diplomat was being reproached by the United States for &quot;having failed in Somalia and for lacking firmness on certain issues.&quot; It said, also, that the United States was encouraging female candidates &quot;even though these people have not yet declared their candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Boutros-Ghali must be aware that the battle is lost, despite the yet undeclared support of some western countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It wondered whether France would support him to the extent of alienating the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nothing is less certain,&quot; it said. &quot;And yet, France should be at the forefront of the countries supporting Boutros-Ghali among which many African and Francophones do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If support is not forthcoming, it said, this would &quot;very likely expose the injustice in the method&quot; of chosing leaders of international institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One of the principles of democracy consists in respecting the viewpoint of the majority. Within the U.N. the continued existence of the veto, which no longer corresponds to no political necessity, limits and even stiffles the expression of the majority's right,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The election will be so controversial that, as with that for the NATO secretary-general where the White House had its own preferences, a third candidate is likely to win the seat,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whether or not Boutros-Ghali is re-elected...the real issue is that, this election is going to be so controversial that the revision of the texts governing the institution will be inevitable, despite the American veto,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most Mauritanian newspapers published stories on the arrival of Israeli's first diplomat to Mauritania, who landed in Nouakchott June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of that city's daily newspapers, Le Calame, said that the dipolmat's arrival was evidence that extensive Spanish mediation between Noakchott and Tel Aviv was finally taking effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These relations are perhaps deeply ingrained in a broader strategy that brings together several partners (in their effort) to avoid future sources of conflict and, mainly, to circumvent the (militant) Islamic threat.&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe - President Robert Mugabe Friday said that the organs of his ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front (ZANU PF) were in shambles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, he told a meeting of the ZANU PF central committee here, the party's ordinary members were not participating in its decision making.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe, whose party won all but three of the 150 seats in last year's parliamentary elections, regretted that the organisational restructuring has not been completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the party's process of selecting candidates for constituencies left behind a lot of acrimony and accusations that some unfit candidates had been imposed on the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwean leader, who has been in power since 1980, also overwhelmingly won the presidential elections held earlier on, after his opposition challengers withdrew, claiming that the electoral law was not transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned that the party should wake up to the truth, lest one day it would be overwhelmed by the truth, saying 1996 could not be allowed to pass without implementation of the restructuring exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The people massively support us, but our party organs for them are in shambles. Can we this day pledge ourselves to accomplish the party re-organisational task in 1996,?&quot; asked Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In light of the good agricultural season, Mugabe said the party also had a duty to protect communal farmers from unscrupulous businessmen out to exploit them by offering them cash for their produce at far less than officially declared prices.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka, Zambia - Zambia's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Frederick Chiluba has said that it will meet opposition political parties for reconciliatory talks only if they publicly renounce violence and stop campaigning for international sanctions against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conditions were announced Thursday by MMD national chairman Sikota Wina in the capital, Lusaka, in the wake of renewed calls by the opposition parties for resumption of the aborted interparty talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling party in May snubbed scheduled interparty consultations intended to ease rising tension over the government's disputed constitutional amendments and preparations for this year's presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba has since assented to the controversial constitution which bars former president Kenneth Kaunda from contesting the presidency. It says only Zambian-born citizens with both parents also born in Zambia qualify for the presidency. Kaunda had Malawian parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties have condemned the new law as discriminatory and undemocratic. They have accused the ruling party of enacting the law out fear for Kaunda as an individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are also protesting what they call &quot;haphazard&quot; arrangements for the elections which they claim the MMD wants to rig.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD government in 1995 engaged a private Israeli firm, Nikuv Computers, to update the national voters register, ahead of the elections.  The opposition have charged that Nikuv is an arm of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence organization, and that it has been contracted to rig the polls in favour of the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wina said Thursday that all parties needed to agree to an electoral code of conduct by pledging to cooperate with the country's electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition have launched an international campaign for sanctions against Zambia. They also want the Chiluba government ostricized by the international community until it agrees to a universally accepted electoral process for the forthcoming polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, which had been assisting in the country's democratisation process, announced this week that it was withdrawing its support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said in a statement that it was not satisfied that there would be free and fair elections following the limitation of choice of leadership by the voters. It was referring to the ban on &quot;non-indigenous Zambians&quot; from contesting the presidency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka, Zambia - Bondo Lusato, a man engaged by the opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) to investigate President Frederick Chiluba's birth origin, claimed in Friday that he bought a &quot;fake&quot; birthday certificate in Zaire to show that the president was born there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusato told a press conference in Lusaka that he, with his friend John Simusoko, had conspired with medical officials at Chibambo Mission in Zaire to produce a new birth certificate to show that Chiluba was born in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusato said that after failing to come up with evidence to prove that Chiluba was born in Zaire, they decided to buy a fake certificate which was later given to UNIP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One's birth place has become critical for Zambians aspiring to become president. This is as a result of a recent constitutional amendment which bars citizens with foreign-born parents from constesting the highest office in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia is due to hold presidential elections in 1996 in which former President Kenneth Kaunda was pitted to run against the incumbent, President Chiluba. Kaunda, who had Malawian parents, has been disqualified by the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusato claimed that UNIP, led by Kaunda, paid the two men 3,000 U.S.  dollars in December 1995 to go to Zaire and fake information on the birth of President Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusato, who produced the fake certificate to reporters, charged that the privately-owned Zambian newspaper, the Post, had provided two video cameras to him and one of its reporters when he travelled to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked by reporters if he knew the seriousness of the offence he had committed, Lusato said he was aware and had already told the police about the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know that what I did was wrong and I am asking for forgiveness from all Zambians and in particular the president and his relatives. My mind that time was corrupted,&quot; he said, adding he no longer wanted to be investigator for the Post or UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusato, who announced that he has now rejoined the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Chiluba, said that he had not yet approached the president to seek his forgiveness and that he will do so through the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local reporters led by Richard Sakala, the special press assistant to President Chiluba, were in 1995 taken to Zaire to verify reports carried by the Post, that Chiluba was born there. The newspaper is currently facing charges after State House sued over the article written in 1995 alleging that Chiluba was born in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Post carried an article Monday which claimed that Lusato, one of their witnesses in the on-going court trial, had been bought by State House for 200 million kwacha (about 200,000 U.S. dollars) to work out a &quot;credible denuciation&quot; of everything published by the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to local reports Friday the opposition Zambia Democratic Congress said it has instructed its lawyers to petition the courts about Chiluba and Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda's citizen status in the light of the new constitutional amendments enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congress charged Thursday that it had sufficient information and evidence from its investigators in the United States, Belgium, Zaire and Zambia to the effect that Chiluba's parents were born and came from Zaire and had later migrated to Luapula and settled in Musangu village, northern Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congress also claims that Miyanda's father came from Angola via Mozambique to eastern Zambia where he married a local woman there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe Defence Minister Moven Mahachi said Friday his country was not threatened by the huge arms procurement made recently by neighbouring Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't feel threatened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have an excellent relationship with Botswana,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botswana recent bought German-designed Leopard tanks and North American fighter bombers worth one billion zimdollars (100 million U.S. dollars). The purchase has baffled western diplomats and political analysts, with some suggesting the buy could trigger an arms race in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mahachi told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency, or ZIANA, that Zimbabwe was satisfied Botswana was buying the arms for self-defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Botswana is a very friendly country. We don't want to interfere if our neighbors buy large arms. We have no legitimate right to ask them,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botswana is reportedly expanding its army from 7,000 to 10 000 troops and officials were quoted in press reports as saying the build-up was part of a long term plan to beef up its deterrence capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the end of apartheid in South Africa it is unclear who Botwsana's potential enemy might be. However, one radio report has said recently that Botswana wanted to improve its capability to take part in peace-keeping operations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbabane, Swaziland - Swaziland's civil servants resolved Thursday to join a strike by the country's teachers which began June 14 to force the government to an 18 percent salary increase for civil servants and teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil servants had given the government one week from June 14 to reconsider what it said was its final offer of a 9.9 percent salary increase plus housing allowance increases amounting to a total increase of 13.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swaziland's acting prime minister, Sishayi Nxumalo, said Tuesday that the government was unable to budge from the maximum increases offered to teachers and civil servants which total 91 million rand (about 21 million U.S. dollars).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said if government were to give the 18 percent demanded it would cost another 52 million rand (12 million dollars) which, he added, the government just has not got.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Successive finance ministers have warned of the dangers facing the government due to the growth rate of the civil service and shrinking financial resources to pay the increasing salary bills and pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement Thursday reacting to the refusal of the teachers and civil servants leaders, Finance Minister Derek Von Wissell warned &quot;if the government is forced to pay the 18 percent demand when the state of the country's economy is so sensitive there was a real possibility of the International Monetary Fund imposing structural adjustment measures on Swaziland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said if this were to happen it would result in thousands of Swazis being retrenched and important development projects having to be abandoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the strike resolution taken at Thursday's Civil Servants Association meeting in Manzini is being challenged by the government and by civil servants who attended the meeting as unconstitutional and illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That it &quot;could be considered unconstitutional&quot; was admitted to PANA Thursday by the association's secretary-general, Fortunate Zwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the association had some 27,000 registered members but Thursday's meeting was attended by an estimated 2,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zwane said she did not know if all were association members as the meeting was open to the public and no cards had to be shown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I agree there was no quorum,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - At least four other family members of detained Nigerian politician Moshood Abiola have been interrogated in connection with the June 4 murder of his wife, Kudirat, family sources said in Lagos Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those arrested Thursday were Abiola's younger brother Mubashiru and three members of his extended family, the sources said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola's eldest son, Kola, arrested Tuesday, is still with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian police are not giving out much information on the arrests, to avoid jeopardising investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were indications that the international police could be involved to help unravel the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat, 44, was shot dead by unidentified gunmen, while driving in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She was an outspoken supporter of her husband, Abiola, the presumed winner of the June 1993 presidential election, annulled by the military regime that ruled Nigeria then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola is awaiting trial for treasonable felony after he declared himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before her death, Kudirat and Kola were involved in a family feud over Abiola's legal representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kola wanted his father's original defence lawyer changed because of what he called lack of progress in the case, but Kuridat resisted the move.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian authorities have not yet officially reacted to the setting up of a pirate radion station that has been broadcasting opposition propaganda intermittently on Nigerian airwaves since Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wednesday was the third anniversary of the 12 June 1993 presidential election annulled by the country's last military regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unclear if the station, calling itself Radio Democratic International Nigeria, is operating from within or outside the country. Its short wave signals are, however, being received in several Nigerian cities.  These include Lagos and Abuja, the nation's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Playing Nigeria's discarded national anthem and tunes by Afro-beat musician, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the station kicked off with an anti-government broadcast by Anthony Enahoro, self-exiled leader of the National Democratic Coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday it aired an interview with another self-exiled Nigerian 1986 nobel literature laureate, Wole Soyinka, critical of the military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soyinka, who fled Nigeria in November 1994, described detained politician Moshood Abiola, the undeclared winner of the annulled 1993 presidential election, as the &quot;embodiment of people's will.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pirate station said it would soon announce its full programming for broadcasts in Nigeria's three major languages -- Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman of the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission said the commission would issue a statement on the &quot;illegal&quot; station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar transmission by another pirate station calling itself Radio Freedom Frequency, hit the Nigerian airwaves several times last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The broadcasting commission dismissed it as illegal. Its operators have not been found.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, he said, could only be achieved if the media remained professional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election newspaper, named The Monitor, is published by Zambia's Committee for a Clean Campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will cover all political events including campaigns during the run-up to the 1996 presidential and general elections scheduled for October. It will also act as a guide to political education for the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayope termed the newspaper's establishment timely and crucial to the transition period of the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIAMEY, Niger (PANA) - The 43 billion F CFA loan (about 860 million dollars) credit line which Niger recently obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) marks the end of a long dispute between the West African country and the Bretton Woods institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For six years, under pressure from trade unions and other political problems, the authorities in Niamey and the IMF were unable to reach any agreement on structural adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two parties had in 1990 agreed on a framework program on economic policy. It, however, remained unimplemented because of the country's long national conference, which led to the introduction of multipartism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the July 29 to November 3, 1991 conference in Niamey, the 1,200 delegates voted against implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program (SAP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things changed with the election of Mahamane Ousmane, a staunch advocate of SAP, as president in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Mahamadou Issoufou, managed to conclude an agreement with the Bretton Woods institutions. The government was forced to shelve this agreement due to pressure from trade unions which went on an indefinite strike in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the two sides continued to maintain close contacts. In December 1995, Niamey wrote a new letter of intent to the financial institutions in Washington D.C..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At about the same time, changes in parliamentary seats downgraded the coalition of President Mahamane Ousmane to a minority, forcing him to name Hama Amadou, of the former ruling party, as prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amadou's government concluded a three-year agreement with the IMF. But the program hardly got off the ground when the military seized power Jan. 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The militarymen promised to conclude negotiations with the IMF and the World Bank. To achieve this, they retained the experienced Almoustapha Soumaila as finance and planning minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrival of the Fund's deputy director-general, Alassane Drame Outtra, in Niamey on Thursday, was a clear indication that relations between the two sides had improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day earlier, the IMF board signed the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility agreement, opening new credit lines for Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-year agreement ends the financial embargo which Niger had to contend with for six years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIAMEY, Niger (PANA) - Niger's military ruler, General Ibrahima Bare Mainassara, on Thursday night officially launched the country's presidential election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move was a rebuttal of appeals from the Independent National Election Commission that the elections be postponed to July 27.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission had asked for more time to sort out organisational problems, especially the compilation of the electoral roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a nationwide radio and television broadcast Thursday night, Gen.  Mainassara pledged to &quot;keep the army out of the political game&quot;. He also called for a sense of national interest by urging &quot;fellow citizens from all parties to bear in mind that they all belong to the same country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gen. Mainassara, leader of the military junta that seized power in January, is standing as an independent candidate against four others supported by their parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are Tandja Mamadou of the National Movement for Development Society; Mahamane Ousmane, former head of state overthrown by Gen. Mainassara and a candidate of the Social and Democratic Convention; Mahamadou Issoufou of the Niger Party for Democracy and Socialism; and Mahamadou Issoufou, former prime minister in Mahamane Ousmane's government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AMMAN, Jordan (PANA) - Mired by a host of problems, most of sub-Sahara Africa is not making substantial progress in basic education and literacy, according to a report being discussed at the Consultative Forum on Education For All (EFA) which entered its second day Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Basic education is not progressing at the pace that will enable most countries to attain more than modest EFA targets by the end of the decade,&quot; the document says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haiti is the only country, outside Africa, in the same category of less performing countries in education and literacy. They are so categorised at a time when most countries of the world are making major breakthroughs in educating their peoples.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report cites such problems as drought, famine, internal conflicts, political instability debt and unfavourable terms of trade, among some of factors which have compromised EFA goals in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African countries were among 155 states which endorsed the goals at the 1990 World Education Summit in Jomtien, Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In that year some 37.3 million sub-Sahara African children were not in school. At the end of 1995, the number had risen to 39.3 million. Girls make up two-thirds of this number, according to the report issued by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The agency is hosting the Amman forum along with the World Bank and other U.N. agencies including UNICEF, UNFPA and UNDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the past five years, total primary school enrolment expanded by only 17 percent to 72.3 million pupils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the results cites considerable progress in literacy, which rose from 40.2 percent in 1980 to 56.8 percent in 1995. Two-thirds of the region's male adults are literate, compared to less than half of adult females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Jomtiem, more than half of the countries in sub-Sahara Africa, including some of the least developed, have been able to reverse the steep decline in basic education and literacy of the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report cites the case of Mozambique, which recently emerged from 16 years of war and has been able to increase primary school enrollment by 155,000 in the last five years. The country hopes to put some 1.6 million children in school by the end of the decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania and Senegal are also among the countries which have made significant strides in the achievement of the world's education goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report estimates that some 2.5 billion U.S. dollars would be required to provide universal primary education in the continent each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sub-Sahara Africa alone pays more than 20 billion dollars annually in servicing and repayment of its 300 billion external debt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON), unveiled Monday guidelines for the registration of political parties under the military government's transition to democracy program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission's chairman, Sumner Dagogo-Jack, said political associations seeking registration must have at least 40,000 card-carrying members in each of Nigeria's 30 states and at least 15,000 members in Abuja, the nation's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has an estimated population of 100 million people. NECON said some 24 million Nigerians voted in the last local council elections in March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dagogo-Jack told a news conference in Abuja Monday that his commission would not place any limitation on the number of persons that could belong to a political party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said &quot;it is a strict condition for registration that membersip of a political association should, among others, exclude persons below the age of 18 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other persons excluded from joining party politics are members of the armed forces, the police, security agents, para-military organs, members of the pubic service and traditional rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To qualify for registration it is mandatory for a political association to have a manifesto containing the aims and objectives, as well as its principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NECON chairman said associations seeking registration as political parties must submit the relevant application with &quot;a short profile on who, when and where the idea of the association was conceived, its motive and its intellectual or philosophical background.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Registration forms are to be available from Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's chequered political history has involved some 25 years of military rule in its 36 years of independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Second Republic of 1979-1983 was run on six registered political parties under the American-type executive presidential system cut short by the 1994 New Year's eve coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aborted Third Republic, midwived by the last military regime of Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida, crashed ever before it took off under two political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politician Moshood Abiola, who claimed victory in the June 1993 presidential election annulled by Babangida, is in detention awaiting trial for treason after be proclaimed himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But following the March council poll, new political associations have emerged. A re-alignment of forces by Nigerian politicians is also underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is unclear how many of the associations will qualify under NECON's registration procedures.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Children in Addis Ababa Monday adopted a declaration calling on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to ensure the rights of all the continent's children to education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The declaration was adopted at the end of a two-hour &quot;Children's Parliament,&quot; convened as part of the activities marking this year's day of the African child, which was observed Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document is to be forwarded to next month's OAU summit, to be held in Yaounde, Cameroon from July 8 to 10.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The declaration urges OAU member states to ensure the survival and development of the African child, as stipulated in the U.N. convention on the rights of the child and the African charter on the rights and welfare of children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The children's parliamentary session was organized to commemorate the &quot;Day of the African Child&quot;, which was proclaimed by the OAU in memory of the 65 Soweto schoolchildren masacred June 16, 1976 by the South African apartheid regime's police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actual day fell Sunday, but the OAU requested that its observance be shifted to Monday, with events befitting this year's comemorative theme -- &quot;Education for Peace and Development: Rights and Welfare of the Child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia's &quot;Children's Parliament&quot; was presided over by Dawit Yohannes, speaker of the federal assembly. He was assisted by two child co-speakers: Miss Kabaye Liku of Nazareth school in Addis Ababa, and Abenet Taye, a student from Dire Dawa in Eastern Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After an opening statement by the Ethiopian speaker, the children parliamentarians and the real ones debated the theme of the Day of the African Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate also covered the rights of children to education, and the children asked elder parliamentarians about war and peace, and what should be done to promote education and development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, a &quot;Children's Dialogue&quot; session was held at Africa Hall at which officials from the Ethiopian government, the OAU and UNICEF responded to children's question on the day's theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Children from many other African countries, whose parents work for the OAU and other international organizations in the Ethiopian capital, also took part in the dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message issued Friday to mark the day, the OAU urged African governments to ensure that all children, and girls in particular, have access to high quality education.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The children proceeded to the Libya &quot;Brotherhood&quot; office (Embassy) in Khartoum where they were addressed by the ambassador who said the sanctions against Libya were the doing of the &quot;powers of arrogance and Zionism.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanctions were imposed on Libya following accusations that it supported terrorists responsible for the crash of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The airliner exploded in midair, killing all on board. The demonstrators handed memorandums condemning the sanctions against Libya and addressed to the United Nations, the Organisation of African unity, the Non-Alignment Movement, the Organisation of Islamic Conference and the Arab League to the general secretary of the Sudanese Council for International Friendship, Ahmed Abdulrahaman. Abdulrahman said it was unfortunate three of the Arab countries -- Sudan, Libya and Iraq -- were subject to the United Nations sanctions. He said Sudan will continue to stand by Libyan people until the U.N. sanctions are lifted. The memorandum pledged the Sudanese children's solidarity with those of Libya in the face of the sanctions, which has had a &quot;tremendous effect on the bodies and souls of the Libyan children.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, Mozambique (PANA) - At least 50,203 landmines and other explosive devices have been cleared in Mozambique since the country's peace accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to statistics from the National Demining Commission (CND), cited in Monday's issue of the daily paper, Noticias, 6,017 kilometres (3,730.54 miles) of road have been cleared.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the program is now facing financial problems, said the CND's executive director, Osorio Mateus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The operation is being undertaken by the Mozambican government, in coordination with the United Nations and several Western NGOs, notably Norwegian Peoples Aid, and the British Halo Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mateus in the report complained that the Mozambican government has not yet released the necessary budget for the CND's full scale operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need to buy equipment for our work and we still don't have the money,&quot; he said. &quot;This makes it difficult to establish CND regional delegations, or to set up a data bank to allow us to gather all the information needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mateus added that the government has only released five billion meticais (about 445,000 US dollars) for the CND. The amount is not, however, enough for the work the directorate must do, Mateus said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CND is negotiating with the German government for the establishment of a data bank on mines in the country and a preliminary agreement has been reached, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mateus said that the United Nations is also looking for consultants to provide expertise to the CND.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Nine Zambian soccer fans were crushed to death Sunday and 52 others injured when they were trapped between a closed gate and a stampede of other spectators trying to leave Lusaka's Independence Stadium after a match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses said the large crowd in one part of the 35,000-seater stadium surged toward the nearest exit gate but found it closed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the victims fell down and were trampled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This occurred at the end of an international World Cup preliminary qualifier match between Zambia and the visiting Sudanese national soccer team. Zambia won the game 3-0 to qualify for the next round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu denied the accident was caused by the &quot;tight security&quot; enforced at the match attended by President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some witnessess suggested the police had deliberately left the gate closed after the match to allow the presidential motorcade quick exit through the stadium grounds. The motorcade left through a different gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the first such incident involving deaths of spectators at a soccer stadium in Zambia. Police blamed the incident on congestion at the stadium, which was filled to capacity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - A medical professor has disclosed that about 79 percent of the male and 46 percent of female students in Zambia are sexually active.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Alan Haworth told delegates Tuesday at the on-going sixth national aids conference in Lusaka that a study he conducted early this year found that 36 percent of &quot;born-again-Christian&quot; students and 34 percent of those who were not born-agains said they regularly had sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presenting a paper on &quot;Youth and HIV infection: What challenges face HIV/AIDS programmes&quot;, Haworth said the study, conducted in 17 learning institutions which included secondary schools and training institutions, found that pornographic films had influenced students sexual behaviour.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The youths actively got involved in sex after watching pornographic films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haworth said that 80 percent of students who watched pornographic movies said they were sexually aroused after watching the films, while another 80 percent of the male and 73 percent the female students admitted that they watched pornography.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said 80 percent of the male and 31 percent of the female &quot;born-again Christians&quot; said they were also sexually aroused by such films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that pornographic films were bad in any society as they influenced the moral behaviour of children who later wanted to try what they watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haworth blamed churches in the country which he said were in the forefront agitating against condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the church advocated for morality, Christians themselves were involved in sex which could spread HIV infection, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said about 50 different denominations in Zambia are very strong on their views of not allowing the use of condoms, which was dangerous to the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the study, 25 percent of the students said they were engaged in oral sex, most of them after watching pornographic films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haworth said that over 50 percent of the male and 33 percent of the female respondents said they masturbated, while 34 percent born-again Christian students also admitted doing the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, however, contrary to what people say masturbation does not cause any physical or psychological harm to people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudanese newspapers have angrily reacted to the 3-0 the defeat of their country's national football team in the return World Cup qualifier match in Lusaka last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The defeat has been hard to digest because the Sudanese team had defeated the high-performing Zambian side in Khartoum 2-0 a fortnight ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sports critic Ahmed Mohammed El Hassan, writing in the government daily El Sudan El Hadeeth, on Tuesday rejected the allegation of biased refereeing &quot;because after all the kicks, did not cancel a goal our players had netted&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we accept it that the referee had hepled the Zambians with two fake scores, we should then ask the legitimate question: What did our talkative forwards to to change the result? How many goals did they score?,&quot; the critic asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile all the Khartoum dailies also focused on the row over the ball used during the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government daily, El Engaz El Watani, said the secretary of the Sudanese Football Federation, Shams Eddin, had complained to the world soccer governing body, FIFA, that the ball was too small and did not carry the FIFA stamp as required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paper said the Confederation of African Football observer and the referee had objected to the ball the day before the match but the Zambian side failed to change it when the two teams went on the pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A cartoonist ridiculed this claim by posing the question: How was the ball unsuitable? Was it drunk?&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Khartoum papers wrote about the death of nine soccer fans and injury of 50 others in a stampede at the Lusaka stadium entrance at the end of the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Lusaka stadium tragedy is ranked second to the aircrash that claimed the lives of all members of the Zambian national team three years ago&quot;, wrote El Engaz El Watani.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Nervous foreign investors are scrambling to off-load shares on the Zimbabwe stock market amid uncertainty about the future economic direction of the Southern African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trading in the week to June 17 was mainly characterised by profit taking, with Delta Corporation, the largest quoted company, experiencing the heaviest loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures showed that in the fortnight to last Friday, Delta was the most actively traded share, with trade worth Zimdollars 39.4 million (3.9 million U.S. million dollars), representing 36.2 percent of total market trading of Zd 108.8 million (11 million U.S. million dollars).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to market analysts, foreign investors bought just five percent of the Delta shares and sold at least 52 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Share prices have come under attack during the past two to three weeks, which has caused both (industrial and mining) indices to fall from their recent record highs,&quot; the company Dataworld said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key industrial index was on June 17 quoted at 5,478.22, a fall of 2.8 percent from the record high of 5,637.2 set on May 27, while the mining index also fell from a high of 1,565.22 on May 2 to 1,431.3 last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dataworld, mining shares were coming under pressure from the weak gold price, as well as the collapse of the copper price on June 14, following the shock announcement by the Japanese trading house, Sumitomo, that it faced a loss of 1.8 billion dollars due to unauthorised trading in copper by one of its dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The stock market can be expected to continue to drift downwards over the next few weeks as buyers continue to pull back while selling pressure increases in selected counters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The number of available bargains should increase as some sellers are bound to overreact in the absence of firm buyers,&quot; Dataworld said, but warned investors to be selective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the industrial index was on Tuesday quoted at 5 469.7, down 8.53 points from Monday, while the mining index also lost just over 30 points to end trading at 1,401.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, has inaugurated a 16-member National Human Rights Commission and renewed his administration's commitment to the protection of personal liberty and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Administering the oath to the commision's members in Abuja Monday, he said the recent amendment to two controversial decrees on detention of persons and removal of the armed forces personnel from the Civil Disobedience Tribunal, were clear demonstrations of this commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has been under international pressure over its troubled march to democracy and record in human rights. The pressure was intensified with the November 1995 executions for murder of nine Nigerian human rights minority leaders, among them author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inaugurating the commission, Abacha promised that his administration would bequeath &quot;a virile democratic polity, an orderly society and a responsible citizenry to present and future generations of Nigerians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he added that the rule of law and fundamental human rights hardly thrived in anarchy or disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I also seize the opportunity of this occasion to remind our people,&quot; he said, &quot;that no absolute rights exist here or in any other human society (as) our rights are of necessity limited by those of other individuals and the larger needs of our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the commission's briefs is to assist victims of human rights violations and seek appropriate redress and remedies on their behlaf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will also to undertake studies on all matters pertaining to human rights and assist the government in the formulation of appropriate policies on human rights issues for public enlightenment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission will publish periodic reports on the state of human rights protection in Nigeria and organise local and international seminars, workshops and conferences on the subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expected to liaise with local and international organisations with the aim of advancing the promotion and protection of human rights in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The body is chaired by retired Supreme Court Judge Paul Nwokedi. Its members include journalists, lawyers, representatives of non-governmental organisations and government officials.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The United States-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs said Tuesday it will suspend its election-support programs in Zambia effective June 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency's president, Kenneth Wollack, said in a statement from Washington D.C. that the measure is being taken because of the unstable political environment in Zambia. This situation, he said, could threaten parliamentary and presidential elections for 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the organisation was unable to undertake programs to ensure open and fair elections when there was no dialogue among Zambia's major political players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Therefore, once our funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development expires June 30, NDI plans to suspend its election-support programs and withdraw its Lusaka-based staff,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wollack said that the institute was deeply concerned that the political environment leading to the elections threatened to undermine Zambia's status as a model of democratic change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1991, the institute has been helping Zambia consolidate its democratic institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Five years ago the citizens of Zambia made a historic turn in their call for multiparty democracy...actions that have curtailed electoral competition and participation, political discourse and freedom of expression raised serious questions for meaningful elections,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy of President Frederick Chiluba recently adopted constitutional amendments to bar former President Kenneth Kaunda from running for office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda had Malawian parents. The amendments require that only Zambian-born citizens with both parents also born in the country, or were of Zambian descent, qualify to run for republican president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new law also bans traditional chiefs from participation in politics, unless they resign their traditional thrones. It also recognises Zambia as a Christian nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba had, earlier in 1996, taken the constitutional debate to his government-dominated parliament in defiance of widespread public demand that the constitution be adopted by a constituent assembly and referendum for wider consensus on the country's supreme law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western donor countries, including the United States and Britain, have told Chiluba to reverse the constitution or risk losing bilateral aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian opposition parties have appealed to the donors and neighbouring Southern African states to impose sanctions on and ostracise Chiluba's government. They say this would force him to revoke the constitution which, they claim, is discriminatory and undemocratic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Defence lawyers for eight detained United National Independence Party (UNIP) members facing treason charges Wednesday appealed to a Lusaka magistrate to order Zambia's Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) to appear before the court to explain why he had not processed their docket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight, who include UNIP vice-president, senior chief Inyambo Yeta, are facing four counts of treason. This is in connection with the Black Mamba terrorist group that has launched a bombing campaign in the southern African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Principal resident magistrate Francis Nsokolo reserved ruling to Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsokolo said he needed time to study submissions by both the defence and prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accused are being represented by 16 lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the defence lawyers, Edward Shamwana, asked the court to order that the DPP appears in person to explain why he had not consented to his clients' docket so that trial could proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under Zambian law, the DPP needs to be satisfied about the merit of some of the more serious cases, including treason, before sanctioning prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence lawyer Sebesitain Zulu said he had himself approached the DPP on June 4 and asked him to get the docket from the police so that he could decide on the case before the accused appeared in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is quite clear that the police have not yet handed the docket to the DPP because they are still investigating,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda later told a huge gathering of party supporters outside the courts that the current government of president Frederick Chiluba will put Zambia on fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are dealing with little political savages and frightened little men who will put this country on fire,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He charged that the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) were afraid to confront UNIP on a clean political platform and that is why they have enacted an &quot;apartheid&quot; constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution bars Kaunda, who had Malawian parents, from contesting the presidency later this year. Kaunda was Zambian president for 27 years before losing power to the MMD in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda said UNIP was not behind the Black Mamba and his members in detention were being prosecuted because they were UNIP supporters.<BR>HEADLINE<BR>Nigeria<BR>Mediation for Nigerian University Teachers' Strike<BR>(by<BR>Panafrican News Agency<BR>June 19, 1996<BR>by Paul Ejime , PANA Staff Correspondent<BR>(tx</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Committee of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian universities were meeting Wednesday to try and resolve the deadlock between government and teachers striking for better service conditions and funding of higher education in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This followed the expiry Wednesday of a government ultimatum for the teachers to resume work or face mass dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in Nigeria went on strike April 9, accusing government of reneging on a pledge to review a 1992 accord with the union on better pay and funding of the country's 40 universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following a breakdown of negotiations, the military government on May 16 banned ASUU. It accused the union of formenting trouble and disrupting academic work on the campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government also froze the striking teachers' pay and threatened to evict them from official housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also said negotiations were to continue with individual universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, the National Universties Commission directed vice-chancellors to report progress in their individual universities on the directive to reopen them by Wednesday (June 19).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some vice-chancellors opened registers for signing by teachers willing to end the strike. The teachers were to be paid their frozen salaries after signing. Those who chose to continue with the strike were told to count themselves fired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were also indications that government could formally shut the universities, should the strike persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But according to reports from several universities, the government directives have provoked mixed reactions with a number of teachers having reportedly signed the registers to protect their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, ASUU national president Assisi Assobie in a statement Wednesday claimed that closing the institutions or sacking the teachers was not the solution. He said negotiation remains the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A check at the University of Lagos and Lagos State University Wednesday showed that most teachers were not at work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBABANE, Swaziland (PANA) - A nationwide strike by teachers in Swaziland entered its third day Tuesday after negotiations between the government and leaders of the National Association of Teachers and the National Association of Civil Servants again failed to reach agreement over a salary dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acting Prime Minister Sishayi Nxumalo said Tuesday that government was unable to offer more than 9.8 percent salary increase and housing allowances totalling 91 million rand (almost 20 million U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nxumalo said if the government were to give the 18 percent demanded it would cost an additional 52 million rand (12 million U.S. dollars) for teachers and civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, he said, would force the government to retrench large numbers of civil servants to avoid the expenditure on the civil service exceeding the maximum required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of 40 percent of the total budget. Expenditure above this would result in the IMF imposing harsh structural adjustment measures on Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nxumalo said the alternative would be for the government to abandon some important national development projects in order to use the funds to pay the teachers and civil servants their demands. Government, he added, would not do this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, thousands of members of the Swaziland National Association of Students are expected to gather today for mass meetings in each of the country's four regions. They are expected to discuss the disruption of education caused by the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Civil Servants Association are due to hold a mass meeting in Manzini Wednesday to decide whether to join the teachers' strike, if no agreement is reached with the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim called on governments Wednesday to address, seriously, the root causes of refugees and to create satisfactory conditions for their voluntary repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message marking Africa Refugee Day to be observed Thursday, he said that the plight of refugees could be overcome &quot;only through greater respect of human rights, national reconciliation, social and economic progress and the establishment of lasting democratic institutions.&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa, he said, needed the contributions of each citizen to enter the 21st century as a prosperous continent and therefore could not afford refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite efforts by Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mozambique and Sierra Leone at voluntary repatriation, he said, the magnitude of the problem of refugees and displaced persons remained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said this had &quot;seriously disturbed the OAU and has become a source of its major concern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are seven million refugees and at least 20 million internally displaced Africans. These, Salim said, were victims of conflicts in countries such as Burundi, Liberia and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hosting these people has brought about destruction which the asylum countries suffer, Salim said, &quot;as refugees forage for firewood or grazing cattle, causing severe loss of vegetation cover and the depletion of the carrying capacity of the land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long-term effect of this and the impact on the conservation of natural resources was, he said, enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem, he added, was also emerging increasingly as a source of tension between states. Therefore, he said, solving this problem had become urgent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is even more critical given the enormous pressure that it exerts on the resources and security of the countries concerned,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some countries had granted asylum to refugees and Salim said this demonstrated their &quot;enormous generosity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The enormity of the refugee problem, he said, had caused the O.A.U. and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to chose the environment as the theme of the commemoration of this year's refugee day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regions most affected by the problem of refugees in 1996, he said, were central and west Africa, where there was a crisis of &quot;monumental proportions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In these regions, most refugees are to be found in Cote D'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations (Department of Humanitarian Affairs, June 19) -- The United Nations today requested the international community to provide $1.3 million for emergency assistance to the Central African Republic in response to humanitarian needs arising from armed conflict last month. The request is contained in an inter-agency situation report on that country issued today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict among elements of the Central African Republic army seriously damaged the already fragile infrastructure, creating considerable humanitarian assistance needs in that country. While immediate food needs will be met by the World Food Programme (WFP) through existing stocks, the proposed assistance programme, which is to cover a three-month period ending mid-September aimed at meeting on a priority basis the health and nutritional rehabilitation requirements of vulnerable groups in Bangui, the capital. It will also address gaps in the areas of education, agriculture and animal health which, if left unattended, could seriously affect key socio-economic sectors and create an additional destabilizing factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations agencies in Central African Republic -- the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), WFP and World Health Organization (WHO) -- have, in collaboration with other international and national relief organizations -- Midecins sans frontihres, Belgium, and Central African Red Cross -- carried out assessments of the immediate crisis-related humanitarian requirements. The details of these requirements are spelled out in the &quot;Expanded Situation Report&quot; on that country sent to Member States and concerned relief organizations today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - Statement by U.S. State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns on June 19 condemning killing in Burundi of civilians near Kibimba, three International Committee of the Red Cross workers near Cibitoke, a nun in Gitega:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States vehemently condemns the massacre of over 70 civilians near Kibimba, the recent killings of three ICRC workers near Cibitoke, and the June 16 murder of a nun in Gitega. The Kibimba massacre was reportedly carried out by elements of the Burundi military; most of the victims were women or small children. The ICRC workers were killed by unknown assailants while traveling in a clearly marked Red Cross vehicle; they were attempting to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population. Insurgents reportedly attacked a car carrying three Burundian church workers near Gitega, killing one nun.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call upon the government and military of Burundi to undertake complete and transparent investigations of all these incidents, and to do all that is necessary to bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice, including, if appropriate, members of the Burundi military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These cowardly murders of innocent civilians, aid workers, and church workers are appalling, and once again underscore the necessity for all sides to abandon violence, join together in frank negotiations, and commit themselves to peace and reconciliation. Violence begets violence in Burundi, and the only way to reverse this self-destructive course is for all Burundians to renounce violence as a means of resolving their differences and find a path toward peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. repeats its call to all parties to reject extremism and work together for a better future for all Burundians. The Mwanza III peace talks, organized by former Tanzanian President Nyerere, provide a unique opportunity for parties across the political spectrum to seize the moment and find a way to bridge the differences that separate them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - The resuscitation of a project, shelved in the eighties, for the establishment of a paper and pulp project at Chintheche in Nkhata-Bay, north Malawi - a joint venture between Birla Engineering Services of India and Malawi's Viphya Corporation Limited (VIPCOR) - rests upon the investors' ability to raise US$250 million (MK3.75 billion) for the project, and the outcome of an environmental impact assessment (EIA).Prospective donors for both the EIA study and the paper project are the World Bank and the African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pace and direction of the project's implementation, however, depends on how soon the final EIA study will be done and on its recommendations. The EIA will itself depend on the outcome of a detailed project report to be prepared by the technical partner and VIPCOR. In 1991/92, an environmental study was done, but only focused on three areas, Chikangawa, Elephant Rock and Bondera Village, as possible sites for the paper and pulp plant. However, Mrs Eta Mmangisa from the Ministry of Research and Environmental Affairs said the study did not include the lake shore site, Chintheche, now wanted by Birla Engineering Services for the paper and pulp plant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chintheche has always been a favourite site for the project. The place was originally proposed in the 1970s, but the project is now known to have fizzled out due to the economic recession at that time - contrary to the widely held belief that the project was shot down by donors who were not satisfied with mechanisms put in place for the disposal of effluent from the mills. Fears have been expressed that Malawi would reap millions of Kwachas from the project but lose billions if it starts without detailed and careful planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from the paper and pulp plant, there are a number of other projects due to be implemented under the agreement, such as the manufacture of organic fertilisers, charcoal briquettes and the rearing of dairy cattle and meat goats, the General Manager of VIPCOR, Luke Jumbe has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VIPCOR Project Manager, Cedric Makunganya, in an interview said the project will need an initial capital of US$250 million, with construction work due to start in three years' time. &quot;The project will obviously need a lot of government support to kick off,&quot; said Makunganya, adding government will have to act as a guarantor for the local partner, in order to raise the required capital. The exact equity holding in the joint venture is yet to be worked out, though Makunganya hinted the technical partner could get up to 51% of the shares if it so wished, with the local partner taking up the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is estimated that the plant, which will have a capacity to process 100,000 metric tonnes of pulp per annum, will offer direct employment to 1,200 people. With expansion, some 6,000 others will be indirectly employed in planned chemical companies, following the establishment of the paper and pulp plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; For Chintheche, there is need for the new study as the last one was done 18 years ago and is now stale,&quot; said Mmangisa.  &quot;6The population of Chintheche, for example, is not the same as it was in the 70s, while the new site also poses the question of how the pulp will be transported. &quot;The Ministry of Natural Resources is aware of this and is to advise the developer accordingly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Makunganya, however, remains very positive. ''The technical partners are quite capable. They run the biggest paper mills in Nigeria, Kenya and other countries. They will try to adhere to international standards,'' he said parrying fears that effluent from the mills would harm aquatic life in the nearby lake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; I should congratulate Grain and Milling for reducing the prices&quot; President Bakili Muluzi said on June 9 in Lilongwe. This is what we want&quot; he said and asked other companies to emulate the milling company's example by also reducing their commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muluzi said the government will not hesitate to revoke licences of companies which overcharge without justification. In the rural areas, 50 kgs of maize now sells for K60 ($5).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFORD'S MONTH OF NOTICE GIVES PROBLEMS TO UDF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a rally in his home district of Machinga, President Bakili Muluzi indicated that it would be difficult for the UDF to work with AFORD, its coalition partner, as they serve a month long notice.''I wish to tell them to leave immediately, &quot; he said, as though telling the country that AFORD's pull-out was &quot;good riddance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muluzi said he had not enjoyed the working relationship with AFORD since the party started making threats to pull out, saying that it was at that time he lost confidence in the party. He said the party's pull-out would not in any way shake the government's proceedings. However, the UDF is now left with only 85 seats in the 177- seat chamber, far short of the two-thirds majority it needs to pass decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NO DEBT FORGIVENESS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi does not qualify for debt relief, the World Bank representative in Malawi, Mr Arif Zulfiqar said in a recent interview. Malawi wants the international creditors to scrap the country's Mk31.5 billion ($2.1 billion )debt. However, Zulfiqar said Malawi's debt is not serious enough to merit debt forgiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi is among the many African countries that appealed to multi-lateral donor nations at a recent summit in Washington for a 90% debt reduction. The Paris Club of Creditor Nations identified seven African countries: Burundi, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe, Sudan, Zaire and Zambia as eligible for debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOSPITAL EMERGENCY LOOMS DUE TO LACK OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government has by-passed formal tendering procedures for the procurement of drugs and other medical supplies, as a last minute emergency stop-gap measure to prevent a looming crisis in the health care system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A high powered four-man delegation left June 8 for Europe to arrange the air-freighting into Malawi of an emergency order of Mk8 million ($ 533,000) worth of medical supplies for the country's major hospitals of Lilongwe, Queen Elizabeth Central and Zomba General Hospital, where the situation is described as desperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior government official - who asked to remain anonymous - leading the group said in an interview that the measures have been taken to avert a crisis after the government learnt that the stock of medical supplies it had ordered from Europe, and which were expected in the country early or mid May, would not be arriving until end July. &quot; As you know tendering is slow, but without authority the ministry cannot procure anything,&quot; the official said.He was accompanied to Europe by officials from the health, treasury and central tender board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He complained that the public has so far been misled on the issue of drugs in the country. He said the health ministry had now been given authority to procure what is available locally and abroad outside normal tendering procedures, as an emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOVERNMENT TO BUY ESTATE LAND</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lands and Valuation Minister, Peter Fachi, announced June 11 the government is to buy 600 hectares of land from Mandala Properties, in Mulanje southern Malawi, and redistribute it to the landless in the district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fachi said the government would buy the land at MK18 million ($1.2 million ). Mandala Estates have a workforce of nearly two thousand. The workforce will be absorbed by the Malawi Tea Company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - Malawi has become the first country in the world to wipe out leprosy and has achieved the feat five years ahead of schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British Leprosy Relief Association(LEPRA), Director Terry Vasey, in announcing the news said Malawi could be happy and proud for beating all other countries in the world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1991 the World Health Organisation set the year 2000 for the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem. But Malawi, said Vasey, hit the target five years early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Malawi in 1966 there were close to 2000 registered patients. By last year, there were only 764 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently LEPRA is supporting a research centre in Chilumba where the organisation is trying to establish if there is a link between leprosy and the human immuno deficiency syndrome. So far, said Vasey, no connection had been found between the two.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - On 13 April this year, shortly after he finished duty, a 38 year-old night guard at the Malawi College of Forestry, Romeo Sadaraki, was killed by a stray elephant bull which he had pelted with stones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An eye witness, Weluzani Mofati, later said Sadaraki had reacted to the shouts of the people who had tried to scare the elephant bull away. He walked up to within 20 metres of the elephant and started pelting it with stones.  The enraged bull trumpeted three times, before charging. Sadaraki took to his heels, tripped and fell. The elephant struck Sadaraki with its tusks, trampling on him killing and him on the spot.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sadaraki's violent death by an elephant is an isolated case in Malawi, a country which witnesses man's indiscriminate slaughter of game without the slightest regard for their value - economic or ecological.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Malawi, like in many other countries in Africa, man is the biggest enemy of wildlife, having already rendered some game and fish species extinct and threatening the existence of many others. Rhinos, for example, are extinct in Malawi, except for the two juvenile ones that the government imported from South Africa in 1993. Many other types of wildlife in Malawi face the same fate as that of the rhinos if the present rate at which they are being massacred is left unchecked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parks and Wildlife Officer in south Malawi, Leonard Sefu, said in an interview that the most sought-after game in the country is the elephant.  These animals are a target for game poachers because of their valuable tusk.  The elephant population in all the country's national parks and game reserves is diminishing at an alarming rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kasungu National Park in central Malawi was once home to 2,000 elephants. Today there are only 200 to 300 left - the rest have been killed off and their tusks smuggled out of the country, says Sefu. In the Majete Game Reserve, south Malawi, there was a population of 300 elephants a few years ago. But all of them have been wiped out. He said there are still a few elephants left in Vwaza game reserve in Mzimba, in northern Malawi but they are also under threat of being wiped out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The general picture is one of gloom for all types of wildlife in the country,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Sefu, poachers sneak into the game reserves and kill the elephants with AK47 attack rifles. Elephant tusks are then smuggled out of Malawi to Zambia and Mozambique. From there the ivory finds its way to Europe and Asia. As in many other countries, Malawi's elephants are protected and poachers, once caught, are prosecuted and sentenced. So far prison sentences have been anything from three years upwards but judging by the increasing rate at which poaching is taking place, it is clear the punishments are not severe enough to stop the offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between January and February this year, Sefu says, over 40 hippos have been killed along the Shire River, near the outlet from Lake Malawi. The Shire is Lake Malawi's outlet and the country's biggest and longest river. It drains into the Zambezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Malawi's population growing at a rate of 3.2 % yearly there has been an increased demand for land suitable for cultivation. As a result, people along the Shire River, just like in many other parts of the country, have opened up gardens in places previously not cultivated. Some of these places are long-time natural grazing lands for hippos and they naturally come and graze on the crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sefu says villagers in the area are not happy and so they poison the hippos to protect their crops. The people of the villages believe they have been cheated by their local politicians. These politicians promised to pressure government to relocate the hippos to the nearby Liwonde National Park, once they were elected to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But wildlife officials contend that removing hippos from the area was an untenable thing since hippos, like other animals, have natural habitats where they must be protected. They say that people should report crop destruction to the authorities, not just kill the animals, and especially not by poisoning as this might be dangerous to other animals and fish, as well as people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a 1990 count, there were 6,000 hippos in Malawi but Sefu however believes that with increased human activities the hippo population has been reduced considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hippos are one of Malawi's most popular tourist attractions. They are part of Malawi's &quot;big five&quot; - lion, elephant, buffalo, hippo and leopard - that people want to see. The big five used to include the rhino, not the hippo. But those days are gone in Malawi as in many other parts of Africa.<BR> Malawi News Online is a fortnightly news update produced by Malawian journalists in cooperation with South Africa Contact, i'Afrika Magazine and Inform-bbs in Denmark.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has often received a poor press over the issues of internal democracy and lack of respect for human rights. Such criticisms were used as an excuse for the schism at Nasir in 1991. Since then, the SPLA has embarked on a programme of reforms which has gone a considerable way towards increasing internal democracy and improving the guerrilla army's record on human rights. The SPLA has initiated this programme whilst continuing the military struggle against the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime in Khartoum. Though detractors might still point out the need for further improvements, it cannot be denied that the SPLA's progress in these areas has been both remarkable and impressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The democratisation process began with the SPLA's first national convention in April 1994. Following on from that successful exercise in democracy, a senior officers' conference was convened in August and September 1995. Over one thousand SPLA officers attended and debated the issues fiercely. Naturally, military matters were also discussed and astute readers will no doubt make the connection between this conference and the SPLA's successful military offensive that began in October 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of the conference lay in convincing the military leadership of the movement of the need to pursue the creation of a working civil society in the liberated areas. Without the support of the military leaders such an exercise would be futile. It is admirable that the SPLA is currently attempting to instate civil authority over the military with the active acceptance and co-operation of the military leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Civil Society Conference: This reporter has just returned from a ten-day stay in Southern Sudan where he attended and participated in an SPLA conference on civil society and civil authority. The conference was held in the Imatong Mountains in Eastern Equatoria in the liberated lands that the SPLA has renamed the New Kush. The actual valley where the conference was held is known to the local tribe as Eman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tribal chiefs from the Dedinka, Taposa and Latuka tribes from the surrounding areas were invited to participate in the conference. Many international guests and observers also took part. The local chiefs expressed their concern and grievances with the SPLA and, in particular, complained of guerrilla fighters who married local women but who then failed to abide by local customs and traditions. Fighters have been accused of leaving their women and children behind when they move on to other areas and postings. A comparison was made with the Northern soldiers who have also abused the local populations. Complaints were also made about the arbitrary arrest, maltreatment, torture and even rape of the local tribes people by the SPLA soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Misapprehension: The exchanges at the conference were very frank and honest. This led one foreign delegate, who represented a British-based humanitarian organisation, to conclude that the SPLA was on the verge of another split. She flew from Eman-New Kush to Maridi in Western Equatoria and said as much to the local SPLA commanders there. However, such is the new born confidence of the guerrilla army that the young lady's concerns were recognised as naive and were dismissed accordingly. Four or five years ago such rumours and comments might have caused serious problems between the humanitarian agency and the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frankness and Openness: The conference also heard some positive stories of the SPLA's role as liberator in Southern Sudan. SPLA fighters have often risked their lives to save civilians. They have protected whole communities from the NIF regime's forces and they have evacuated civilians from the war fronts when necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA was given a chance to put its side of the story the day before the conference split up into committees and discussion groups. Commander Uyai Deng Ajak summed up the attitude of the SPLA soldier when he said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not perfect. We are human beings and we make mistakes. We have made mistakes in the past and will most definitely make mistakes in the future. To say that we deliberately target our own people for mistreatment runs contrary to the objectives for which we took up arms and is objectionable. We have in the past corrected the mistakes made by individual SPLA soldiers and we will continue to correct these mistakes in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commander Uyai said that the real question needing an answer from the people of Southern Sudan is whether they want the armed struggle and the liberation to continue. If the Southern people want it to continue, then, he said, they must give their full support to the SPLA's systematic reforms designed to educate the SPLA soldiers on issues of human rights. Commander Uyai received a lengthy applause at the end of his speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference was then addressed by Commander Majak Agot who is in command of officers' training. He stated that the SPLA had already incorporated human rights charters and issues into the officers' training programme. He asked that the civil population be patient and understanding because the new reforms would take time to have an effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps the most representative view came in the form of a poem read by one of the SPLA women commanders, Commander Grace Datiro Okerruk, entitled, &quot;I Don't Complain&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issues at Stake: The conference discussed many issues including the relationship between a civil society and authority in a democracy; the development of democratic institutions in the civil society; the role of the civil authority in the socio-economic development of society; the democratic empowerment of civil society and civil authority, on the one hand, and the military during a liberation struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference split up into seven committees, each considering specific aspects of the civil society issues. These committees made many valuable recommendations which are expected to be implemented in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the many positive aspects of the conference was the presence of so many international guests. They included representative of human rights organizations, humanitarian and relief organizations, the United Nations and other international aid agencies. All were impressed that the SPLA could convene such a conference in the midst of a liberation struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some harsh remarks about the SPLA's past record were inevitably made.  However, significant progress was observed by the representative of Amnesty International who encouraged the SPLA to continue on this path towards full human rights observance. The representative commended the fact that the SPLA appears no longer to be keeping political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The aid agencies themselves were not free from criticism. The question of agreeing to common norms of human rights observance was raised time and time again. There was concern about double standards when measuring human rights abuses. Many human rights organizations persist in quoting data from the past just to make a point. For instance, that the SPLA too abuses human rights. The agencies were criticised for having made little endeavour to recognise the SPLA's achievements on the human rights front over the past two years. These organizations were accused of continuing to use data from pre-1991, often without furnishing an accurate date, and claiming that this is indicative of SPLA practice in 1996. These organisations have taken to the extreme the notion that they must be even handed and often repeat the tired old cliche that &quot;both the NIF regime and the SPLA engage in human rights abuses&quot;. Such comments ignore the reforms within the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the international agencies at the conference had met with the SPLA last November, when many of the sensitive issues and irritants in their relationship were discussed. This meant that at Eman-New Kush the atmosphere was far more relaxed and amicable in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the international personalities who attended the SPLA civil society conference and who addressed the meeting was the president of the Swiss-based Christian Solidarity International (CSI), Reverend Hans Stukelberger. He told the conference that the secret to gaining and maintaining public support for any political movement lay in its ability to respect the freedom and views of the individual members of society. He described the levels of democracy in Switzerland and offered them as a successful example of decentralised power within the state. He welcomed the chance to visit Southern Sudan because he was now better able to appreciate the potential of its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CSI has been a steadfast campaigner against the human rights abuses of the NIF regime and the atrocities committed against the people of the South, the Nuba Mountains, the Ingessina Hills an the Beja region. It is also involved in humanitarian support to the people of these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPLA Leader's Closing Remarks: The conference was opened and closed by the leader of the SPLA, Colonel John Garang. The theme he adopted on each occasion was similar: that liberation and development are not mutually exclusive and must progress simultaneously. The SPLA must begin developing the liberated areas while the struggle for liberating the rest of Sudan continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonel Garang described an elaborate vision of the alliances that will need to be forged with elements within the old Sudan if the development within the new Sudan (the liberated areas) is to be consolidated. He differentiates between the old Sudan as represented by the extremist Islamic policies of the NIF, currently in power, and the ld Sudan of the traditional political forces, who have now come to accept that the predominance of one religion and culture is untenable and unworkable. He sees the old Sudan of the political parties in alliance with the SPLA against the old Sudan of the NIF. Colonel Garang's vision incorporates two basic premises: firstly, that there is a common political agenda based on the Asmara Declaration of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA); and secondly, that the SPLA's military strength and policies will need to be maintained to ensure that each party lives up to their part of the deal. He believes that the representatives of the North and the South must accept each other's word at face value if the relationship is to succeed. He believes it is possible to build a new Sudan of democracy and equality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Sudanese of all political persuasions were united last month in agreeing, each for their own reasons, that the presidential elections in Uganda held considerable importance for the people of Sudan. After all, Uganda is host to the largest number of Sudanese refugees and also in recent years the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime has provided support and assistance to the Ugandan rebel group the so-called Lords Resistance Army (LRA). The Ugandan government of President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has been at the forefront of the peace initiative organised by the peace committee of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outcome of the elections was a resounding victory for President Museveni as the Ugandan people voted to continue the stability he has brought to their country over the past ten years. The &quot;Gazette&quot; welcomes this result as President Museveni has been a good friend to the Southern Sudanese people, which in the eyes of the powers that be in Khartoum made him a potent foe of that repressive regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Member of IGADD: As a member of the IGADD peace committee, Uganda has tried to mediate an end to the Sudanese civil conflict. Those efforts have been frustrated by the actions of the NIF regime which has refused to continue working with IGADD. That is because the peace committee has defined and identified the root causes of the conflict in its Declaration of Principles (DOP) and Khartoum did not like what it said. The DOP has been accepted by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the opposition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which have incorporated it into their national agenda. The NIF regime objects most strongly to the clauses on Self-determination and the creation of a secular state. In response to IGADD's efforts, the NIF regime has attempted to destabilise the IGADD states of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda through terrorist activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, the authorities in Kampala have established that Khartoum has sponsored the LRA, a bizarre Christian Fundamentalist group from North-eastern Uganda, provided it with training and military equipment and infiltrated it across the border from Southern Sudan. The regime has used the LRA to destabilise the border areas, and has countered any accusations from Kampala by claiming that President Museveni is actively providing military support for the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the presidential elections in May, the LRA supported President Museveni's principal opponent, Dr. Paul Ssemogerere, a former foreign minister in Mr. Museveni's administration. Mr. Ssemogerere campaigned during the elections for Uganda to reconcile with the NIF regime, a policy which he had pursued even whilst foreign minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the initial meetings of the IGADD peace committee on Sudan in Nairobi in 1992, Mr. Ssemogerere worried his colleagues from the other countries by adopting a similar position to that of the NIF regime. The Southern Sudanese delegation was greatly alarmed at this. Perhaps IGADD would never have endorsed the DOP if Mr. Ssemogerere had not been called away on urgent business and replaced by his deputy minister. He never returned to the IGADD talks, whilst the support for the DOP was consolidated and the principles adopted as the basis of the peace initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strong Stand on Issues: President Museveni has taken a strong stand on the causes of the conflict in Sudan. He is unusual amongst African leaders in that he sees nothing to be gained from failing to address the causes of internal political dissent wherever it occurs across the continent. He has urged all African leaders to speak out for fairness and justice in those parts of the continent, like Sudan, where political grievances are ignored and human rights blatantly violated by the regime in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his inaugural address at the swearing in ceremony in Kampala on 10 May, attended by several African heads of state, President Museveni warned the NIF military leader, Lieutenant General Omer Hassan El Beshir, to watch his step with Uganda. There will be no adopting of a policy of appeasement towards Sudan and if Khartoum does not desist from its policies of subversion and support for terrorists, Uganda will take the necessary action required to end Khartoum's provocations, Mr. Museveni warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the election campaign, Mr. Museveni spoke of the horrendous situation imposed by the regime upon the people of Sudan. Addressing a political rally at the beginning of May, he complained that African leaders were not doing enough to help the people of Southern Sudan. He said that Mr.  Ssemogerere, his opponent, was wrong to suggest a reconciliation with Khartoum when no effort had been made to redress the causes of the conflict in the first place. The Ugandan leader promised that he would put an end to the insecurity in Northern Uganda caused by Khartoum's support for the LRA and he would also ensure that Africa addresses the causes of conflict in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugee Problem: One of the direct effects of the conflict in Sudan has been the influx of refugees from Southern Sudan into Northern Uganda. Over the past five years the number of refugees has increased dramatically because of the regime's policy of aerial bombardment of civilian settlements.  President Museveni has ensured that the huge refugee population has been cared for and looked after despite the burdens this has placed upon his country's resources. On the other hand, the Khartoum regime has demanded that Uganda close its border with Southern Sudan in order to stop the refugees from crossing over. It has been Kampala's refusal to carry out such a policy which has resulted in Khartoum's terrorist activities in the border areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugee situation and its role as a political football between Kampala and Khartoum is nothing new. Many Southern Sudanese can remember past atrocities which arose from collusion between Uganda and Sudan. It is these memories which made the refugees so concerned at the talk of reconciliation engendered by Mr. Ssemogerere in his election campaign. Whether the presidential candidate was playing politics to win votes, or whether he really intended to carry out this policy is immaterial now. However, it did cause concern to many refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent Examples: In the 1960's, Father Saturnino Lohore was a political leader of some repute in the South. He had been a member of the 1958 parliament that was removed by the Abboud regime following the coup d'etat.  The Catholic priest was an ardent advocate of a federalised Sudan. In 1966, Father Saturnino Lohore was assassinated by security agents of the government which replaced the Abboud regime at his native village of Loronyo near Torit in Eastern Equatoria. When the &quot;Vigilant&quot; newspaper exposed the story and insisted upon a public inquiry into the death, Khartoum used its influence with the Obote government in Uganda to concoct a story whereby Father Saturnino had been killed by a Ugandan border guard whilst trying to cross the border illegally. Many Southern Sudanese will remember countless other examples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Divided Opinion: Whilst all Sudanese were interested in the outcome of Uganda's elections, their motives for being so differed considerably. The Khartoum regime and its supporters would have dearly liked to see President Museveni defeated because the election of one of his opponents would have given the regime a weak political leader to deal with. Following Mr.  Museveni's resounding victory, Khartoum now realises that it will have to deal with an experienced politician who is well aware of all of the regime's tricks and schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most Southern Sudanese have been relieved to see President Museveni re-elected. The refugees inside Uganda need not worry about the repercussions of this victory. However, supporters of Riek Machar, with their most recent moves towards an all out incorporation into the system of the NIF regime, will have viewed the victory in Kampala with some considerable concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It must now be hoped that with the elections out of his way in Uganda, President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni will use his new mandate to press ahead with the IGADD peace initiative, together with his other three colleagues, Presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and Isaias Afeworki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Xenawi of Ethiopia. The result of the Uganda elections is good news for the long suffering people of Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Nine soccer fans died in a stampede at Lusaka's Independence Stadium Sunday and 76 others were injured seriously at the end of an explosive Zambia versus Sudan World Cup qualifying match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But by this morning University Teaching Hospital Public Relations Manager, Don Mwape, was reporting that all but 12 of the injured had been discharged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Mwape reported that apart from the nine who were brought in dead last evening there had been no other fatalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the still admitted nine are men and three are women, while 64 have been discharged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A survivor, Mr Kelvin Munkanta, who is still nursing his wounds in ward GO1 of the University Teaching Hospital said the stampede was triggered by a group of hooligans who shouted a warning, as jubilant fans were trooping out of the stadium, that a bomb had been planted at the entrance of 'D' Gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the fans in front pulled back in fear of the bomb that really was not there they met tremendous resistance from those who were still headed for the exit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the ensuing 'pulling and pushing' some fans begun to collapse and as they did so they were quickly trampled by the surging mass of people. Some of the victims survived with injuries but the unlucky nine met their deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu disclosed that six of the dead were men while three were women, who included a woman police constable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is difficult to stop such a stampede and there was little which my officers could do,&quot; he said at the UTH last evening shortly after the tragedy occured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Red Cross volunteers at the stadium had also treated some fans who had minor injuries while some reporters actually counted six such casualties being taken on stretchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deaths at the stadium are the worst in the sporting history of the country and they shocked and dampened the nations celebrations once the magnitude of the tragedy spread to every corner of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Youth, Sport and Child Development Minister, Samuel Miyanda, described the deaths as the most tragic thing to happen especially since the national team had so gloriously won the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba was among the more than 35,000 strong crowd which turned up for the match but his motorcade left the stadium shortly after the end of the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier the President had granted Zambia national team skipper Kalusha Bwalya a diplomatic passport which will enable him enjoy VIP treatment foreign airports. Mr Chiluba said he hoped the passport will enable skipper Kalusha taken on the responsibility of representing Zambia during his many travels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier before the tragedy Zambia had succeeded in coming out of the rut by white-washing stubborn Sudan 3-0 by the end of the 90 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia had started the return leg under-dogs having gone down 2-0 to Sudan in Khartoum two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambians lived up to the expectations of their hundreds of thousands of fans spread across the country when they made their surge for the goal in the opening minute of the first half which ended with Sudan conceding a corner which was carefully taken by skipper Kalusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no goal from this manouver but hardly ten minutes later when another of the many waves which had shackled the entire Sudanese team in their own half broke on the goal mouth Dennis Lota made no mistake in converting a throw from defender Mordon Malitoli into a sure goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 40 minutes Zambia wom corner number seven and &quot;ambassador&quot; Kalusha floated the ball in from the right. A poor clearance fell to Mutale whose angled shot was turned in via a cheeky back-heeler from Mwewa near the post to make it 2-0.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the two teams went off for half time Sudanese coach Ahmed Abdalla was so upset he gave his goal keeper abdelmanes a tongue-lashing and a rough push towards the dressing rooms. Adelmanes could only cry openly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On resumption of play Zambia continued to pressurise the Sudanese and these efforts were rewarded when Lota headed home a clincher to seal the fate of the Sudanese and open what should have been one of most delightful of evenings but for the tragedy which occured at Gate 'D'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Sudanese national team is not threatened by the presence of skipper Kalusha Bwalya in the Zambian side, trainer Abdulla Ahmed announced on arrival at Lusaka International Airport yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahmed, who is carrying 21 players including two professionals, said while he respected Zambia's skipper Kalusha Bwalya, his team will not fear him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have come to play the Zambia national team which has eleven players and not an individual. We respect Kalusha but I don't think he can be the subject of the match,&quot; said Ahmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Football is a very tough game but we will try our best,&quot; said the native Sudanese trainer, whose side was met by staff from the Saudi Arabian and Sudanese embassies resident in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two professionals in the Sudanese line-up are Omer Ecacamin who plays his club football in oil-rich Oman and Akif Ata, who plays in Qatar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And national soccer team coach, Roald Poulsen has assured that he has assembled a solid backline to check the Sudanese strikers despite the absence of towering Elijah Litana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know Litana is a world class defender and we will miss him but as it is there is nothing to worry about his absence.We are confident that even with his absence, we can still win,&quot; said Poulsen at a Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) press conference yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Angry Sudanese resident in Zambia yesterday inundated The Post newspapers with calls and personal visits protesting against Bright Mwape's Behind The Scenes column which they said belittled their national soccer team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The calls which begun about 09:00 hours in the morning ran throughout the day and included one from the Sudanese ambassador to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot refer to our national team like a bunch of school kids without any idea of football, please leave us alone,&quot; said one early caller before slamming the phone down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Sudanese who only identified himself as Muhammed followed: &quot;Why is Zambia so full of itself especially on soccer. We know you are a great footballing nation but your words on Sudan are unfair to our up coming players.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese protested that they do not want their players to go on the pitch intimidated and emotionally distressed by insults and unfair commentary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a Sudanese living in Zambia I have the greatest admiration for the talent and skill of the Zambian Football team. However, what Bright Mwape wrote in The Post issue of June 13 about the Sudanese national team lacks objectivity and the minimum courtesy for a visiting team,&quot; wrote one Waleed Taha in his letter to the editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwape wrote in his article yesterday titled, Stop Sudan and redeem Africa, that Sudan is not ready to represent Africa in the World Cup and they must not be allowed to mess up Africa's chances at the expense of quality teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argued that the Sudanese victory was accidental and propelled by factors outside skill and good football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I appreciate the frustration of playing amateurs running about in all directions and cheered in their confusion by a religiously partisan croud,&quot; Mwape wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Sudanese ambassador to Zambia argued that the words were too harsh and uncourteous to the visiting Sudanese national team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Your article on Sudan in today's edition has been too insulting. I feel very bad about it. I am not angry but how can you write these things about the Sudan national team. It is not a good way to welcome a visiting team,&quot; said the ambassador who promised to make his complaint more formal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwape maintained: &quot;I could have been of any other nationality but would not have said Sudan in its form is a team for Africa's soccer leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Nine Zambian soccer fans were crushed to death Sunday and 52 others injured when they were trapped between a closed gate and a stampede of other spectators trying to leave Lusaka's Independence Stadium after a match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses said the large crowd in one part of the 35,000-seater stadium surged toward the nearest exit gate but found it closed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the victims fell down and were trampled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This occurred at the end of an international World Cup preliminary qualifier match between Zambia and the visiting Sudanese national soccer team. The hosts won 3-0 to qualify for the next round on a 3-2 goal aggregate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Police Inspector-General Francis Ndhlovu denied the accident was caused by the &quot;tight security&quot; enforced at the match attended by President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some witnessess suggested the police had deliberately left the gate closed after the match to allow the presidential motorcade quick exit through the stadium grounds. The motorcade left through a different gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the first such incident involving deaths of spectators at a soccer stadium in Zambia. Police blamed the incident on congestion at the stadium, which was filled to capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of anxious friends and relatives thronged Lusaka's University Teaching Hospital morgue on Sunday looking for missing relatives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Lusaka - Zambia is to handle threats of aid restrictions from some of her co-operating partners diplomatically, President Frederick Chiluba told his supporters at State House today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba told hundreds of supporters who marched kilometres to show their support and anger at the violent acts of the shadowy terror organisation calling itself, 'Black Mamba' that there was reason for government to quarrel openly with donor governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But that there was sense in reasoning with them over the open pronouncements made by their envoys as regards the freezing of development aid just because the Zambian parliament had enacted a so called 'citizenship clause'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba lamented that the extent of poverty on the continent of Africa had repeatedly compromised sovereignity of democratically elected governments and he appealed to Zambians to work hard in order to earn their own wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He observed that if Zambia had its own resources it would have gone ahead and done many things which suited its own style of government but because of the poverty levels the tune was now being called by rich donor countries who attach grim conditionalities to their developmental aid support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President observed that though Europe had discriminatory clauses on their statutes, this was not allowed to happen in an African country without intereference from outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba expressed unequivocal support for the Constitutional Amendment bill which he signed into law slightly over a fortnight ago saying it will bring genuine independence to the people of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He accused his predecessor, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, of having imposed a brutal dictatorship on the country and its people by ignoring recommendations of the Chona Commission of 1972 which would have resulted in him being voted out of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the 1991 Mvunga Constitutional Review Commission had come up with recommendations which would have strengthened democracy and enhanced human rights but these were conveniently swept aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba told the cheering hundreds of supporters that democratisation was a logn process and there was need for them to observe the rule of law and co-operte fully with the police as they crack down on the 'Black Mamba' organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the arrest of Senior Chief Inyambo of Sesheke district, Mr Chiluba said Chiefs should abide by the Constitution and not get involved in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those of them wishing to be politicians should step down from their thrones and be counted as full fledged politicians who should be treated as such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President noted that it was easy for chiefs to be misguided by political philosophers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba maintained that Chief Inyambo was arrested for his involvement in politics and suspected indulgence in the activities of the shadowy organisation 'Black Mamba' and not out of his traditional affiliations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The National Democratic Institute is to pull out of Zambia at the of June once funding from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDI President Kenneth Wollack said in a statement issued in Lusaka on Monday that the move will affects his organisation's election support programmes and it will the withdrawal of all Lusaka based members of staff.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Given NDI's long standing presence in Zambia and our commitment to the democratization process, this decision was a difficult one for us to make,'' Mr Wollack says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inspite of the pull back NDI will, however, continue to monitor the situation and if dialogue between civic and political leaders will yield desired results then the institute will resume its programme of activities in zambia, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDI talks of 'political environment leading up to this year's elections' without going into specifics but hinting that some of these actions may have curtailed electoral competition and participation, political discourse and freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia adopted a law, end of May, which require future presidential candidates to be Zambians whose parents too were Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some candidates, like former President Kenneth Kaunda, are precluded from contesting elections by this law since his parents came from Malawi and he himself only renounced his Malawian citizenship in 1969 - five years after taking over as President of Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Ministry of Agriculture has allayed fears that the Agricultural Sector Investment Programme (ASIP) might be derailed following the donors' review of their aid commitments to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agriculture minister Suresh Desai disclosed in an interview yesterday that none of the donor countries had indicated intentions, after their general threats to review multilateral and bilateral relations with Zambia, of cutting aid in the ASIP programme which has so far consumed K1 billion in the continuing efforts to revitalise agriculture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I should say none of the donors has made any indication of halting their aid flow in the ASIP programme,&quot; Desai disclosed. &quot;It is for this reason that I feel everything is still on course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, at a meeting held to review progress on the agricultural reforms, the ministry announced that it had met its contribution of K7 billion towards the first quarter of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the same function which was held on May 16, agriculture permanent secretary, Austin Sichinga, disclosed that the programme would be kicked off by the restructuring of the agriculture ministry which would only retain quality staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government further expressed concern at reservations by some donors to commit themselves to help finance the ASIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the United Nations, through its resident representative, Gary Davies, was quoted in the latest Zambia Farmer magazine as having assured that Zambia would be one of the likely beneficiaries under its US$25 billion special initiative on Africa aimed at improving food availability and water supply.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The International Union for the Conservation of Nature has started a wetlands programme in western Zambia which aims at giving further protection to the flood-plain, dambo lands, marginal woodlands and fisheries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Start of the wetlands programme was witnessed by IUCN Southern Africa Regional Director, Yemi Katerere, who explained that the idea is to increase protection the natural habitat of game, birdlife, fish and even domestic animals like cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Katerere disclosed that the programme will consume more than K600 million annually and much of the funding for the scheme will come from the Royal Netherlands government through the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Lusaka.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the launch ceremony Environment Minister, William Harrington, noted that it was only fitting that the wetlands programme was being started in Western Province because the area has for long been a natural habitat for an abundant flock of birdlife, herds of wild game and schools of fresh water fish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Harrington observed that because of the rich grass on the flood plain the area has also been an important kraal for traditional cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Minister disclosed that Western Province at the moment accounts for 20 percent of the entire Zambian cattle herd and 25 percent of all traditional cattle sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is vital to support this particular wetland as it has a major impact on the national economy,&quot; Mr Harrington said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His sentiments were echoed by Ngambela of the Lozi people, Mr Maxwell Mututwa, who told the visitors that natural resource management was not a new phenomenon to people in that part of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He disclosed that for centuries there had been un unwritten laws which controlled the hunting of wild game, the culling of bird-life from breeding grounds known as 'sitaka' and drawing of fish from breeding grounds known as 'masa'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ngambela, who is Prime Minister to the traditional ruler the Litunga, noted, however, that though natural resource conservation was a part of the Lozi it was always refreshing to receive teachings on how such matters can be handled in modern times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He, therefore, thanked IUCN, the Royal Netherlands and the Zambian governments for having chosen the area for the launch of the wetlands programme which may shift to other areas after Western Province.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Officials from a Chinese firm arrived in Lusaka to explore posibilities of opening investment in the Zambian copper industry making it the first country in Africa to attract possible mining investment from Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Management officials from the China National Non-Ferrous Metals Corporation are led by assistant company president, Yang Guneuang, arrived in Lusaka on Monday and proceeded to hold official talks with Mines Permanent Secretary, Joseph Phiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Yang said China imports 500,000 tonnes of copper conecntrates a year and his company has been in the business for many, many years now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company is presently capable of exploring, mining, smelting, refining and processing copper into consumer goods and that was why it was interested in Zambia since the country is a 'granary' of the raw material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Zambia the Chinese team from CNNM Corporation will visit Baluba Mine in Luanshya, Mufulira Mine and surface installations like the concentrator and smelter in other parts of the Copperbelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing the Chinese team Dr Phiri assured the visitors that they were not wrong in picking Zambia for their source of raw resources because the copper ore in Zambia assayed at a much higher level than elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that in the main it averaged 3.8 or 4 percent copper content and this was by far much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition Zambia has a very highly skilled labour force as over the past 30 years more people have been trained in such fields as engineering, geology, metallurgy and actual mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that the interest which the Chinese had shown in Zambia was evidence that the outside world was receiving positively the new investment incentive highlighted in the new Mines and Minerals Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told Mr Yang that Zambian mines had the infrastructure but still required private sector investment for them to operate efficiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following in the footsteps of Mr Yang's delegation will be coming the a government Chinese delegation headed by Vice-Minister of commerce, Trade and Industry Liu Shazai who is expected to sign several aid agreements with the Zambian government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Lusaka - The man who sounded a false alarm at the Independence Stadium in Lusaka igniting a stampede in which nine people were killed was also claimed by the same frenzy as he was crushed underfoot to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Survivors of the tragedy interviewed yesterday said the alarmist shouted that theres was a bomb so that he could create room for himself to manouvre quickly out of the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) one of the survivors, Mr Kelvin Munkanta, said from his hospital bed that the spectator shouted in vernacular that a bomb was about to explode at Gate 'D' as people were trooping out of the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was right next to the man who shouted that there was a bomb and immediately people heard this they retreated,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I saw the alarmist fall down and several others fell on him. I fell too but was lucky my brother pulled me up. Suddenly several people were lying dead,&quot; Mr Munkanta recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police public relations officer Francis Musonda said he had not received a full report on the incident but police had launched investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Munkanta said police manning Gate 'D' closed it in panic after the false alarm causing more congestion as fans were surging forward while others were pushing forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Football Association of Zambia Chairman, Michael Chiti, regretted the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiti, Youth Sport and Child Development Ministry Permanent Secretary Arthur Yoyo and officials from Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) on Monday returned to Independence Stadium to inspect the area where the tragedy occured and afterwards Mr Yoyo reported that all was well at the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were no collapsed walls or broken gates. Neither were there any rolls of barbed which could have prevented jubilant fans from exiting the stadium properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Yoyo promised to inform the nation fully about findings of the investigation into the tragedy which is now underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Youth, Sport and child Development Minister Samuel Miyanda described the event as a sad occurence since the national team had won the encounter with Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the Zambian soccer heroes the tragedy cast a long dark shadow over what should have been their biggest celebration party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talk in their Hotel Inter-Continental rooms and over breakfast was about the tragedy that claimed lives of eight soccer fans at the end of Sunday's 3-0 victory over Sudan at Independence stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That kind of thing shouldn't happen at a football match. Eight lives is too many and although no one seems sure what caused it, it just should not happen at a football match,&quot; said midfielder Joel Bwalya - young brother of star team Captain Kalusha Bwalya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We had a terrific atmosphere in the stadium for the match. I would say the best we have ever experienced and it's a great shame that some of those who helped cheer the team to victory are now not around to celebrate with us,&quot; said the Beligium-based Joel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenneth Malitoli, a Zambian forward, said the tragedy came too soon after the 1993 Gabon plane crash which claimed the lives of 18 Zambia internationals and 12 others en route to a World Cup qualification match in Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's going to scare the fans away from the game. We didn't need this tragedy so soon after Gabon. We were all geared up for celebrations after a great game and a great result but you cannot go out and celebrate with this thing weighing on your mind,&quot; Malitoli said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defender Allan Kamwanga who sat out the match on the bench said the deaths and the injured spoiled the victory party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harrison chongo described the incident as bad for Zambian football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambians are crazy about soccer and to get something like that happening after winning is very sad and bad for the game,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his comments after the inspection tour of the stadium Permanent Secretary Yoyo disclosed that government had already drawn up plans for construction of a much bigger stadium in Lusaka as well as the renovation of Independence stadium so it can reach high international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Yoyo said these plans, will also include the rebuilding of Dag Hammerskjoeld stadium in Ndola which was razed by the Kaunda regime almost ten years ago but never replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Yoyo says government is determined to see that these plans are brought to fruition within the next two years in a bid to advance the game of soccer a step further.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Facing mounting pressure over the death of ten soccer fans, the Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has refuted reports that the match was over-sold saying that only about thirty thousand tickets were sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We did not over-sell tickets. When we realised that more people were buying tickets than expected we ordered the stoppage of the sales. I personally instructed Ahmed Pandor to see to it that no more tickets were sold,&quot; said FAZ chairman Michael Chiti of his committee member, Pandor who also admitted that ticket sales were stopped earlier than planned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some fans who were at Gate D charged that the accident was as a result of the decision to maintain the separation of Gate D from the other gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What FAZ officials could have done was simply to open the joining entrances from Gate D to Gates C and E. It was not necessary to maintain the status quo of those paying K2,500 to be packed at Gate D when the space could not accommodate them all, they should have opened Gate C and gate E entrances,&quot; said a fan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiti, who had gone on a fact-finding tour of the accident area at the Independence Stadium yesterday, further claimed that when it was observed that the Stadium was full, entrance was stopped even to those people with tickets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When we saw that at around 10:00 hours the Stadium was full, we closed some gates and in fact, we also had to let some FAZ officials with VIP tickets stand on the running track of the stadium. And with about twenty minutes before the end of the match, we opened gates to let people move out,&quot; said Chiti who regretted the deaths of the fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On behalf FAZ, I wish to express my sadness over the death of the soccer fans. When playing a game like the one we had against Sudan, we had a lot of support from fans and it is actually the fans that inspired the team,&quot; said Chiti.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) found Zambia with a case to answer after allegedly violating Article 12 of the African Charter that does not permit any member country to deport, expel or chase aliens en masse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Passing judgment on a case advanced by a Senegalese Non-Governmental Organis- ation(NGO) that presented the case of over 500 Senegalese expelled from Zambia last year, the OAU Commission for Human Rights represented by Tanzania, Nigeria, Tunisia and Egypt has ordered Zambia to compensate all the Senegalese forced out of the country in United States dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amount has not yet been revealed but University of Zambia Law School lecturer Michelo Hansungule told a human rights workshop held for all judges from the Supreme, High Court and Industrial relations Courts at Mosi-o-Tunya Hotel on Thursday last week that Zambia was found to be in a habit of violating the African Charter to which she was a signatory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The African Commission on Human Rights made a ruling , especially over the property the Senegalese who were deported and this would cost Zambia dearly, human rights should be respected if this country has to enjoy international commendation, failure to which the international community would make us suffer,&quot;Hansungule said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hansungule said Zambia failed to defend the accusations of violating the Charter and instead admitted to the charges levelled and expressed willingness to pay compensation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are just waiting to be told how much we shall pay as a nation,&quot;Hansungule said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year the government expelled more than 500 Senegalese, 8 Zaireans, 2 Ivorians and 2 Ghanaians - a move which can now not be defended by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Judges meeting took a swipe at the ruling saying the African Commission to which the country was not represented was biased and full of incompetent human rights lawyers. The Judges accused the Commission of being unfair to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hansungule, however, reminded the audience that Article 12 of the Charter applied to every African state and cited a case against Uganda which she lost when some Nigerian nationals were expelled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - No elections will be held this year if the Constitutional impasse and electoral process are not resolved, opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) warned yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC deputy general secretary, Azwell Banda, said in an interview yesterday that his party will not accept what he called &quot;feudal and quack&quot; elections and advised the ruling MMD to revert to the 1991 Constitution for this year's polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unless the Constitutional issue is resolved and all the parties sit down and review the electoral process, it will be impossible to hold elections this year,&quot; Banda warned. &quot;There will be agitation. We have committees in all the 150 polling districts. We are going to set them in motion as soon as the MMD government announces the dates for the elections.  Whether this translates into war is neither here nor there.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda poured scorn on President Chiluba's &quot;habit of arresting political opponents&quot; and warned that it won't work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He can fill up all the jails but injustice is injustice and it will be fought. It won't work,&quot; Banda carped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) chairman, Rodger Chongwe, also maintained in a seperate interview yesterday that the opposition will not allow the elections to take place if the two issues are not resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;During the rally on June 8, we said that we are not going to allow the elections to take place if there is no re-registration of voters. The Nikuv register is deficient and the courts have said so,&quot; Chongwe said. &quot; In fact, as of today nobody is a registered voter in Zambia because Nikuv has not issued anyone with a voter's card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe added that the question of the independence of the electoral commission and equitable use of government facilities and the government owned electronic media should also be resolved before the commencement of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Chongwe and Banda implored the donor community to step up pressure on Zambia and not release aid so that the MMD can do the needful and quickly revert to the 1991 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is the only civilised way of preventing catastrophe in this country,&quot; Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe added: &quot;Chiluba knows that he is no longer popular and his days are numbered. The incident at the Independence Stadium when ten soccer fans died in a stampede after security officers closed most of the gates until after his departure is a sign that he is more freightened now than ever before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday last week Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) president Bishop John Mambo advised against going to the polls with the current electoral register and implored on the MMD to return to the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only way forward is through the interparty meeting. Let's bury our differences,&quot; Mambo advised. &quot; We cannot afford to habour hatred.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But President Chiluba has maintained that governmet will use the recently adopted controversial Consitutional (Amendment) Bill during the forthcoming elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry is instead concentrating on the delayed air service tests being carried out on Aero Zambia's newly acquired aircraft.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was disclosed in an interview with the ministry's permanent secretary, Ronald Mukuma, who explained that the committee responsible for allocating the air service routes had failed to sit due to on-going tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As earlier reported we were supposed to sit by the end of last month but we have had other commitments that have led to the stalling of progress in that area,&quot; Mukuma disclosed in an interview yesterday, adding: &quot; We had problems during the inspection of the Aero Zambia B737 aircraft.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mukuma, however, disclosed that the committee with representation from both the Department of Civil Aviation and the transport ministry, would be sitting to allocate the still 'vacant' intercontinental routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local airlines are most interested in the Lusaka-London route where defunct Zambia Airways slot at Heathrow has remained unserviced since the airline's collapse almost two years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communications and transport deputy minister, Gilbert Mululu disclosed this in an interview in Lusaka on Saturday during the introduction of a new luxury coach by a South African company, Translux.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive manager for Translux, Chris Brand, said in an earlier interview that the duration of the trip from Johannesburg to Lusaka, which takes one day, would be reduced further if the lengthy border formalities were removed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could cut down on the time by more than three hours if the formalities were simplified,&quot; Brand said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mululu said the government was concerned with such delays and an agreement will be signed soon to remove these delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mululu said the understanding to be signed will benefit both cargo and passenger transporters to encourage more investment in the liberalised transportation sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And operations director for Budget Conference -- the Zambian agents for Translux, Enock Kabwe, said the service would soon be extended to the Copperbelt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition parties last week, charged that the move by the ruling MMD government to change the presidential qualifications in the Electoral Act was an attempt to &quot;accommodate&quot; President Frederick Chiluba's troubled candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberal Progressive Party (LPF), Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) and UNIP all called the changes a means by which to enable President Chiluba to qualify as a presidential candidate in the forthcoming presidential and general elections in October this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amendment contained in section 9 (1) (d) and which make it easy for President Chiluba to stand as President requires the candidate to produce certificates which cannot be questioned in courts of law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A candidate for election as President shall deliver - a certificate of birth or where the candidate does not possess a birth certificate, a certificate from the area of his birth issued by (ii) the Chief, whose certificate shall be endorsed by a maternal and paternal relative, as to the truth of the facts stated in the certificate; or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (i) District Secretary;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (iii) a representative of a church certifying the place of birth of the candidate and that of his parents and such certificate shall be conclusive as to the facts therein stated and shall not be questioned by any court, authority or the returning Officer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But LPF president Rodger Chongwe wondered why the courts would not have the power to question such an important qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Village life is such that a chief would not know all the babies born in his village in a day. This will create more lies than we have had before.  Chiluba is trying to cover up his tracks,&quot; Chongwe charged last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNIP publicity secretary Bweendo Mulengela said at his press conference on Tuesday that the MMD had realised the problems President Chiluba would face because of his parentage that is still in question as he has failed to prove it and had decided to amend the Electoral Act to qualify himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They want President so-called relatives to testify to his having been born in Zambia so he can qualify to stand as President,&quot; Mulengela said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC deputy general secretary, Azwell Banda, said his party was aware that between now and the elections, the Electoral Act would be amended to enable President Chiluba, who would had serious problems with his place of birth and parentage, to stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He has already disqualified himself by birth and descent because he is clearly not a Zambian,&quot; Banda charged. &quot; The Act cannot be higher than the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elections Office spokesman and assistant director, Joel Sikazwe, confirmed the impending amendment to the Electoral Act which has become necessary after the Constitution was amended but denied having any knowledge of what the new Act would state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Electoral Act of 1991 which is now being amended, says nothing about parentage and only requires a person to show he is a Zambian, 35 years and above and has mustered 200 signatures from his supporters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba has commended NGOs for the role they are playing in the fight against the spread of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech read on his behalf by health minister Katele Kalumba at the officialJopening of the sixth NGO AIDS conference at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre yesterday, President Chiluba said NGOs are grass-roots based and are therefore an effective channel of communication between the target groups, donor agencies and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba assured the participants that the government was committed to fighting the AIDS pandemic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are going to make AIDS a top priority for external resource allocation so that Africa benefits from the maximum international cooperation and solidarity in overcoming the epidemic and its impact,&quot;JPresident Chiluba said, adding that Zambia was a signatory to the Dakar declaration for global efforts in the AIDs fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Southern African Network of AIDS Services Organisation (SANASO), chairperson Dr Clarence Mini of South Africa, called on the government to re-affirm its commitment to ensure that all people get to know the causes of AIDS. He also implored the government to implement suitable policies in HIV/AIDS prevention and ensure equal access to prevention facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Fullest political commitment to mobilise society is crucial,&quot; Dr Mini said, advising: &quot;No taboos should be allowed to interfere with human life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Tuesday, youth, sport and child development minister Samuel Miyanda disclosed that 500 Zambians are infected with the HIV/AIDs virus every day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing participants at a peer educators facilitators workshop, Miyanda said &quot;the retrospective epidemiological analysis by the World Health Organisation (WHO) of HIV transmission in East and Central Africa illustrates the growing vulnerability of the youth, particularly young women, to HIV infection&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference which has attracted participants from the Southern African region is funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development (NORAD), Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA) and the AIDS/ STD leprosy control programme in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Police security measures to close the gates of Independence Stadium until after the departure of the Presidential motorcade led to the death of ten people and fifty-two injured in a stampede that ensued thereafter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gates which are normally left wide open for most part of second half were yesterday kept locked to allow for the safe passage of the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And one of the injured, John Chibwe of Chelstone, said in an interview last night after being discharged from the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) that security men had put barbed wire across the gates, and closed Gate D.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Police blocked the outlet and when they opened the gates we fell down.  I don't know why the police blocked the way for us,&quot; Chibwe carped. &quot;If it were not for the security men the stampede wouldn't have happened.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But by 20:00 hours last night, Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) officials were not aware of the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not aware of that incident but if it is true, it is a very sad development, but I think the chairman could make an official statement later as he is not here,&quot; said FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka in a telephone interview last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An eye witness, Gilbert Mbewe, blamed the security men and accused them of being overzealous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The police caused that stampede,&quot; Mbewe said in an interview at the UTH after he had been discharged last night. &quot;Innocent lives have been lost because of being overzealous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Inspector General of Police Francis Ndhlovu, claimed that it was not true that his men were trying to shield the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Its not true that police were trying to protect the President, the true version is that as the fans were moving out of the stadium, one of them shouted that there was a bomb within the area they were seated, and hence they rushed out of the stadium and in the process, lives were claimed,&quot; Ndhlovu said in an interview last night. &quot; But I can confirm that by the time I reached UTH, eight fans were reported dead and fifty-two others injured.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the person who Ndhlovu claims to have shouted &quot;bomb&quot; has neither been identified nor arrested by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a reporter from the one of the state owned newspapers, who near the scene, accused Ndhlovu of telling lies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a lie that there was a person who shouted that there was a bomb.  The gate was blocked while the people were pushing wanting to get out,&quot; she said. &quot;And when it was opened those who were in front fell down and were trampled on. And it took the police and the Red Cross about thirty minutes to come and pick up the victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When President Chiluba was entering the stadium paramilitary police men armed took positions while State House security men balanced on the doors of the cars that were in the Presidential motorcade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through out the game the paramilitary men kept on brandishing their guns with the barrels directed towards spectators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is too much. If the President feels uncomfortable with his safety, he should avoid coming to such places,&quot; a soccer fan carped. &quot;This is inconveniencing us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the game had finished President Chiluba's motorcade sped off at a break-neck speed out of the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A revisist to the UTH by The Post found that the police post had been sealed off by armed paramilitary police with the bodies paraded for identification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) yesterday described the accident as most sad for the Zambian people after the 3-0 victory over Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We wish to state that the death of the soccer fans is regrettable and were are sending our condolences to the families of the dead fans and the Football association of Zambia,&quot; ZDC secretary general Derrick Chitala said in a telephone message to The Post last night, adding: &quot; But all this is as result of negligence on the part of both the UNIP and MMD governments who have failed to increase the seating capacity at the stadium, they know that soccer is our number sport but they still fail to invest into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The Co-Chairpersons of the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA) are pleased to announce the appointment of the new Executive Secretary, Ambassador Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah, effective June 15, 1996. Ambassador Ould-Abdallah has succeeded the late Dr. Boubakar Diaby-Quattara, who was the first GCA Executive Secretary from its inception in 1990 until his death in April, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A citizen of Mauritania, Ambassador Ould-Abdallah will be continuing a distinguished career in public service during which he has occupied senior posts in both his own country and in the United Nations. He served as the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General in Burundi from November, 1993, to October, 1995. Prior to his service in Burundi, he was at the UN Headquarters in New York as the Special Coordinator for Africa and the Least Developed Countries, a position to which he returned following completion of his assignment as Special Representative. In this capacity, he represented the UN which was co-organizer, along with the Government of Japan and the GCA, of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in October 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ambassador Ould-Abdallah has held several important posts in his native Mauritania, including Director-General of National Industries (1968-71), Minister of Commerce and Transportation (1971), Ambassador to the United States of America (1973-76), the European Union, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands (1976-79), and Minister of Foreign Affairs (1979-80). He was also a member of the Board of Directors and CEO of Societe Nationale Industrielle et Miniere, Mauritania's largest corporation involved in iron ore mining, in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ambassador Ould-Abdallah is also a co-founder and board member of Transparency International, an international non-governmental organization devoted to fighting corruption, and the author of numerous articles on preventive diplomacy and development issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born in 1940 in Hassi-Abdallah, Mauritania, Ambassador Ould-Abdallah received his higher education at the Universities of Grenoble and Paris, Sorbonne, and the Paris Institute of Etudes Politiques in France. He has been honored by the Governments of Mauritania, Senegal, and Belgium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Global Coalition for Africa (GCA) is a North-South forum dedicated to forging of policy consensus on development priorities among African governments, their northern partners, and non-governmental groups working in Africa. The Coalition is based on the premise that Africa can grow only from within, but that to do so it needs outside support. It seeks to improve the working partnership between Africa and the North which has been evolving for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when sweeping changes are occurring around the world, the GCA seeks to keep Africa on the world agenda and to mobilize international support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The small GCA secretariat is based in Washington, DC at 1750 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1204.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Although African editorials this week focused on seemingly local issues, they were of wider appeal than might at first meet the eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Times of Swaziland, for example, commented on the much criticised effort to introduce a trade control bill in parliament. The proposed bill bars foreigners from running restaurants, cafes and general stores in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Jobs offered by anybody should now be welcomed, whether they are from blacks, whites, browns, yellows or little green men,&quot; it said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The job-seeker on the streets doesn't &quot;give a damn who he works for,&quot; it said, &quot;as long as be gets paid and can see some sort of future ahead and gets experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As many foreigners as possible needed to come in and start businesses, it said, so Swazis could learn from them. In addition, it said there was already &quot;enough legislation&quot; to protect the work force against unscrupulous employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Industrial Relations Act, the Prepared Trade Central Bill and the constant racialism raised in the senate, it added, were &quot;what will deter most decent investors&quot; from bringing to Swaziland their ideas, money and experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wake up Swaziland, while our leaders are fighting each other over who holds the power, our economy is slowly bleeding to death,&quot; it concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The semi-official New Nigeria, published in the northern city of Kaduna, focused on the 26th meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Nigeria-Niger Joint Commission for Cooperation. The paper hailed it as an example of what inter-African relations should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting ended with a commitment to strengthen cooperation on transborder security and enhance the socio-economic status of the peoples of the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It reaffirmed the commitment of the neighboring countries to the objectives of subregional organisations like the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The joint communique, issued at the end of the one-day event, also reiterated the determination of Nigeria and Niger to enhance bilateral relations in the areas of agriculture, livestock, water resources, control of water hyacinth and pests, health, international road links and rail transportation. Others are the redemarcation of Nigeria-Niger boundary, telecommunications, and postal services, as well as the supply of electricity to Niger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The significance of the annual ministerial session can be viewed against the background of increasing socio-economic interdependence and unity among regional and subregional blocs worldwide,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact that it has continued to be held regularly since 1970 testifies to the existence of excellent bilateral relations between Nigeria and Niger,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It welcomed &quot;any initiative&quot; to enhance bilateral relations between Nigeria and its four French-speaking neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a matter of concern, therefore, that while relations on our northern border remains pleasant, the same cannot be said of other borders, notably in the east where armed robbery and recurrent incidents of incursions by Chadian gendarmes, as well as the crisis with Cameroon over the Bakassi peninsula constitute major security threats,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a crying need to build on the gains of such initiatives as the Nigeria-Niger relations with our other neighbors towards fulfilling the cardinal principles of ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nigeria's leading role on the continent emphazises the need for her to maintain excellent relations with her neighbors, and the Nigeria-Niger Commission is a worthwhile factor in this direction.&quot; Notwithstanding such example of excellent inter-African relations, the privately-owned Dakar newspaper, Sud Quotidien, criticised Nigeria's internal political shortcomings. Its comment came against the background of the lack of support for the general strike called by Nigerian opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that three-years after the annulled presidential elections, no country had punished Nigeria beyond the sanctions imposed by the Commonwealth. It asked whether this was not because Nigeria was seen as a large and important country, compared with other military-run states in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;So, it is preferable to attack the small states like Niger, which was forced to bring forward its date for elections, than the giant of Africa were there are still political assassinations,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the weakness of Africa's opposition in challenging ruling parties, Sud used the Central Africa Republic as an example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It cited an unidentified opposition member who joined the besieged ruling party of President Ange-Felix Patasse's Movement for the Liberation of the People of Central Africa, despite protests from his former colleagues.  The individual, it said, told his former comrades that being in opposition did not pay, particularly when it was sterile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This statement is the best illustration of Africa's political reality these last years. In fact, the fight for ideals has given way to to opportunism,&quot; it said. &quot;The phenomenon, already perceptible under one-party systems, seems to be developing and flourishing under (political) pluralism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also cited an unidentified head of state from central Africa who, it said, stated that it was the belly which was talking when the politician defected, meaning hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When it is the case, reason gives way to this urgent need which has to be satisfied immediately. The solution would be to share out the loot, to invite anyone to the feast. Ideological considerations and beliefs can wait if they are not suited to the task at hand,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part the Bangui newspaper, Vouma (meaning fly) commented on the decision to call in French troops to put down an army mutiny in the Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While Central Africans were outraged by the soldiers' mutiny, they were disappointed by the president's appeal for a foreign army, and the French army at that, to intervene in a purely national affair to subdue his own troops, his elite army,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One wonders whether demanding the resignation of a leader, even an elected one, and purchasing a new khaki outfit decorated with medals, a new pair of boots, are sufficient elements to provoke a fraticidal war?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At any rate, there are (now) embers under the ashes. And the one continually stoking the fire is not the Central African citizen but our brother and friend (France?),&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The eighth and ninth witnesses testifying for the Special Prosecutor's Office (SPO) in the case involving top Derg officials clamed here yesterday that Emperor Haile-Selasie appeared lively and in good mood the night before he was found dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both former personal valets of the Emperor, the Witnesses told the First Criminal Bench of the Central High Court that following a successful surgery in late June 1975, his health had made a miraculous recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 59-year old pensioner who claimed to have been very close to the monarch until the latter's murder, the eighth witness said that two attempts on the life of the Emperor had failed before the actual deed was committed on the night of Nehase 20, 1967 E.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, a certain colonel Daniel Asfaw had three days earlier set on electrical device under the chair where the Emperor had been seated to electrocute him but failed. On the third days, the same person came to the room along with the Grand Palace's head nurse, ordered the witness to stay out and forced the Emperor to take a tablet which the Co. said would be &quot;helpful for his vigour&quot;. He said that the Emperor refused to take the tablet and pleaded with them to summon his valet. &quot;At this moment&quot; he recalled &quot;I pushed the door open only to find the Emperors face with sweat and the two people meticulously searching for the tablet that had fallen on the floor.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the two people at last found the tablet and took it with them with &quot;utmost care.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ninth witness, 54, who said he had been working at the palace since he was 15, told the court that he was knocked unconscious with shock when he found the Emperor dead on the morning of Nehase 21, 1967 E.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, the king was grotesquely made to lie with his face up and with a piece of bandage around his neck instead of a sheet. He also sniffed in the room something similar to the one he did when the Emperor underwent medical surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both witnesses said that the night before the murder, their beds were thrown out of the small compound in which the victim was detained and made to spend the night elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They told the court that they were later held prisoners in the palace for two months after which they were realised with a severe warning &quot;not to say anything about the Emperor's death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A tenth witness on his part elaborated on how the burial was conducted secretly. He said that following order by Merid Nigussie, he personally assigned people to dig four burial lots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to this former engineer at the palace, the three lots were of normal size while the fourth, the actual burial site of the Emperor, was 3 meters by 3 meters. He said a room was built over it which later served as an office for ex-dictator Mengistu HaileMariam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason behind the digging of four burial lots, the witness said, was to mislead the staff on the whereabouts of the secret spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This same person pinpointed the spot when Transitional Government authorities disinterred the remains of the Emperor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Virtually all the defence attorneys said they had no hard and fast cross- questions to put all witnesses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Food, clothing and tents were sent for about 50,000 people forced by floods to flee their homes in Afar Regional State over the weekend, the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission announced Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Commissioner Berhane Gizaw said 200 quintals of biscuit, 2,000 blankets, 100 tents and 60 plastic rolls have been sent to Bure-Mudaitu and Gewane areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that verifying team of DPPC had visited Gewane and Bure-Mudaitu last Wednesday to see the extent of damage caused by the flood and the same team will go tomorrow for further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy Commissioner said he had received no information until Monday noon concerning required emergency aid or about the disaster from the Afar Regional State Disaster Prevention and Preparedness bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Commission is, moreover, preparing to dispatch additional food aid to the victims of the flood as the bureau is still in the formative phase and has limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, torrential rain that fell last week in Chero district of West Hararge Zone destroyed standing crops on 738 hectares of land and killed about 346 domestic animals, the wordea council announced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - The Africa Policy Information Center announces its latest publication, USAID in South Africa: Learning Lessons, Continuing Debates.  This 112-page book, written by Douglas Tilton and edited by Jim Cason, is a timely assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of USAID s South Africa program over the past decade. The following excerpts--an Executive Summary and the concluding policy recommendations--provide an introduction to the central themes of the study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Summary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a decade when foreign aid is increasingly under attack as inefficient, unsuccessful, and irrelevant to the US national interest, the South Africa aid program has been held up as a model for a new type of aid -- foreign aid that works. Over the last decade the US has spent nearly $1 billion on programs to assist non-governmental organizations and lawyers defending victims of apartheid, to strengthen community organizations, and to help South Africans develop adult education programs to meet the needs of their new society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as the US aid program in South Africa made a contribution in the period leading up to the establishment of a democratic system in that country, so this study suggests that foreign aid to Africa can play an important role in assisting African development initiatives. At the same time, it argues that foreign aid programs, both in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent, need to be fundamentally refocused to support more directly long-term, sustainable, and equitable development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evaluations of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) program in South Africa have praised its innovative character and emphasized its impact. The US was, for example, the largest single donor to voter education efforts during South Africa's first non-racial national election.  Since then, American assistance has helped the new government and non- governmental organizations to build houses, to restructure government ministries, to improve the educational system, and to address other legacies of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case study in this book highlights these successes and in particular the program's strength in responding to a changing environment. During the past decade, USAID provided valuable assistance to South Africans working to end apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, there is room for improvement. USAID has articulated a commitment to making disadvantaged South Africans the main beneficiaries of its work. But USAID s recent initiatives have not been as successful in addressing the fundamental inequalities in South African society. Generations of segregation and apartheid policies have left most black South Africans with little access to housing, education, health care, and many of the other benefits of modern society. Addressing these legacies is the primary task of Nelson Mandela's government. Yet there is a danger that in the post-apartheid period the small, relatively affluent sector of the urban black population that has found regular employment will enjoy the bulk of the benefits from development planning while a large portion of the black population is left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report suggests that the USAID mission subordinated the goal of enhancing low-income households' access to housing to a more overtly political objective: maximizing the market-orientation of the post-apartheid South African economy. The US assistance program for housing construction was designed to frame the public debate over housing and to point the new government towards specific policy choices by promoting a relatively narrow range of market-based initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One historic strength of the US program has been its emphasis on supporting non-governmental and community-based organizations. The reports endorses continued US support for civil society. At the same time, both as a practical matter and as a matter of principle, US foreign aid to South Africa must be structured to support and sustain development strategies designed by South Africans both within the government and in local communities. One key test for foreign assistance should be how well it helps South Africans to create their own independent institutions that can continue to promote long term, sustainable, and equitable development after the last US aid worker has left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study concludes that the weaknesses of the South African aid program can be traced largely to policy decisions made in Washington. Consequently, USAID personnel have to deal with a complex and shifting set of priorities that make consistent long-term support based on the needs of the beneficiaries nearly impossible. This contradiction can only be addressed through a reevaluation of Washington s foreign aid priorities. The author has therefore identified several policy recommendations for US aid programs in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) Strengthen local control of the development process: The US must work to strengthen the participation of both the South African government and local community-based organizations in designing the structure, content, and priorities of US assistance programs in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) Reduce economic inequality: The US should structure its programs so that the poorest 50 percent of the population are the primary beneficiaries and so as to strengthen the ability of this segment of the population to organize and to articulate its needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) Strengthen local level, community-based and non-governmental organizations: The US should continue to work in partnership with South African-controlled community and non-governmental organizations, but must strive to channel its aid more effectively in order to strengthen these organizations' capacity to deliver services, to engage in policy advocacy, and to realize their own, internally-defined, development agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are compelling reasons to continue to provide assistance to the new government in South Africa, both to support that government through this critical transition period and to enable South Africa to become an engine for development and growth in the entire region. But to achieve these objectives the US assistance program in South Africa must be fundamentally refocused in order to support long-term, sustainable, and equitable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Policy Recommendations for Future Programs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two messages emerge from the preceding discussion of USAID programs in South Africa, both of which have clear implications for the continuing debate over US foreign assistance policy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) US aid to South Africa should be continued. The history of USAID's involvement in South Africa, particularly its support for South African organizations working to end apartheid and to establish a more just political and economic order, has demonstrated that US assistance can help to improve conditions for poor communities. Such programs have had the greatest beneficial impact when they have enhanced the capacity of South Africans to act on the basis of their own assessments of the problems confronting them and their own priorities for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's transition to democracy has not resolved the enormous array of social, political, and economic problems generated by apartheid and by the centuries of oppression on which apartheid was founded. Democratic institutions simply give South Africans a mechanism by which they can begin to rebuild their society, but the extent to which they are able to do this will be determined by the resources at their disposal. At a time when many foreign governments are curtailing aid to South Africa, US assistance assumes increasing importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) The US assistance program in South Africa needs to be refocused.  South Africans are working to identify a development path which is simultaneously sustainable and equitable. USAID's growing emphasis on market-oriented approaches is often inconsistent with the commitment to fair and balanced growth articulated by many South African community leaders. This divergence has become more marked in recent years as USAID has devoted increasing attention and resources to its private-sector projects. It is time for a reexamination of the program's direction and a reorientation of its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both as a practical matter and as a matter of principle, US aid to South Africa must be structured to support and sustain development strategies designed by South Africans, including government officials and community representatives. US assistance should help South Africans to create independent institutions that can sustain equitable development even after the last foreign aid worker has left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Specifically, US assistance programs in South Africa should be refocused in order to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Enhance local control of the development process. US assistance programs must allow South Africans to determine their own development strategies, priorities, and objectives and must respect this emerging agenda.  In practice, this means soliciting greater participation by both the South African government and local community-based organizations in designing the structure, content, and goals of US assistance programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new, democratically elected government in South Africa has established several structures to improve the coordination of foreign assistance. These aim to ensure that foreign aid is allocated within the overall priorities of the government's Reconstruction and Development Program and to prevent project duplication or unfunded budgetary obligations. South Africa also has a network of strong and vibrant community organizations, church groups, unions, and non-governmental organizations involved in development projects. Although the US has worked with non-governmental organizations in the past, the responsiveness of the US assistance program to grassroots South African priorities needs to be improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Reduce economic inequality. The US should structure its programs so that the poorest 50 percent of the population are the primary beneficiaries and so as to strengthen the ability of this segment of the population to organize and to articulate its needs. Evaluations of US assistance programs should assess how well they are serving the poorest of the poor, particularly in rural communities. Explicit attention should be devoted to analyzing the extent to which each initiative redresses the economic legacies of apartheid by promoting a more equitable distribution of wealth within the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the existing aid projects in South Africa are of most immediate benefit to permanently employed black South Africans working in the formal urban economy. These projects, which are often linked to private-sector business development efforts, can have a tremendous impact on long-term development, but they do not directly address the needs of the poorest sectors of the black majority. Moreover, they can exacerbate existing inequalities within the society. US assistance should be focused on programs which provide sustainable new opportunities to that portion of the black population that was most completely excluded from the apartheid economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Build robust and dynamic organs of civil society. The historic strength of the US program in South Africa has been its work with non-governmental organizations, some of which have strong links to grassroots communities. The US should continue to work with South African-controlled community and non-governmental organizations, but must strive to channel its aid more effectively in order to increase the capacity of these organizations to deliver services, to engage in policy advocacy, and to realize their own, internally-defined, development agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tensions inherent in this strategy are obvious. The broadly defined &quot;civil society&quot; in South Africa, which includes non-governmental and community-based organizations, unions, religious institutions, and civic groups, is undergoing a period of tremendous turmoil as individuals and institutions seek to redefine their roles in the new society. Many of these organizations were developed primarily to support campaigns against apartheid. A large number will not have useful roles in the post-apartheid era and will be unable to sustain themselves. US aid should not be used to prolong the lives of organizations which have failed to retain popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, efforts to promote the development of civil society should be complemented by programs which help South Africa's new, democratic government to realize its objectives. Elected officials will ultimately be responsible for defining the broad outlines of social and economic policy and for ensuring the coordinated delivery of services. US assistance programs should facilitate the articulation and implementation of public policies capable of improving the lives of all South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Community-based organizations in particular can play a pivotal role in ensuring the local level, democratic participation in development projects that is essential if such initiatives are to become truly sustainable. At the same time, they can help to create a government which is both effective and responsive by holding the actions of elected officials up to public scrutiny.  In identifying partners in South Africa, the US should assess the degree to which these organizations are accountable to and controlled by the communities which they seek to serve, the effectiveness with which these groups implement their programs, and the degree to which they can ultimately be sustained by funding from within South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - With the generally strong emphasis put on individual success and acquisition today, many find it difficult to identify even among Christians, one who is truly concerned about 'his brother's welfare'. Through &quot;Changed Lives: Testimonies from Zimbabwe&quot; published by a regional fellowship of Christian communicators, one comes face to face with Christians who are a living example of godliness in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In today's world where Christians are &quot;joining the crowd&quot; and succumbing to pressure to compromise their standards, a new book published by the Fellowship of Christian Communicators in Africa and Madagascar (FOCCAM) offers hope that it is, after all, possible to live a godly life as exemplified in the lives of real life characters from Zimbabwe, Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Divided into two sections, the non-fiction &quot;Changed Lives: Testimonies from Zimbabwe,&quot; features stories from different writers about people in Zimbabwe who, in the writers' opinions, have consistently displayed godliness especially in the face of difficulty and trials. The 1995 FOCCAM title is edited by Stephen M. Njiro.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first section contains stories about people who may be categorized as ordinary Christians while the second is about Christian leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 183-page volume is dedicated to the memory of Sally Mugabe, late wife of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who in spite of her death, continues to be a mighty inspiration toward a better quality of life not only for her country but also for the entire continent of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the African Christian, it is said, the true test of faith is seen in times of marriage, sickness and death. It is then that a lot of pressure is put on one to turn for help from African traditional religions and practices that may not be compatible with Christianity which forbids association with diviners and communication with ancestors. This is one major conflict the characters in these stories have to contend with. Forgiveness when deeply wronged, selflessness and perseverance stand out in the lives of these individuals as a hallmark of their godliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the story of Sally Mugabe, late wife of Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, described as &quot;one such rare gift given to the children of Zimbabwe for a painfully short time,&quot; and one who lives on because &quot;she dedicated her life to the service of others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among godly qualities given that set her apart from others is her concern for the plight of children which led her to form Child Survival and Development Foundation, providing patronage to other charitable organisations such as Emerald Hill School for the Deaf, Mathew Rusike Children's Home and Mutamwa Leprosy Colony among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite her kidney ailment, Sally continued to subject herself to the demanding tasks of helping needy people. She pioneered the formation of the Kidney Fund Association and successfully championed for women's rights, transforming the lives of some prostitutes by encouraging them to form a self-reliant co-operative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sally who was also actively involved in the freedom struggle is described as &quot;a wife and a mother at heart&quot; for she took time and effort to ensure her husband's well-being, even preparing some of his favourite dishes personally despite having workers who could do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another example to emulate is that of Stanley, a young man who is mocked by friends and neighbours for not giving in to the advances of beautiful Amanda, a model who other young men would wish to have. Rather than succumb to her advances when she unexpectedly kisses him, a shaken Stanley runs away remembering the biblical story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife. He forgives Amanda who later repents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When fellow schoolmates pour beer into his open mouth while he is taking a nap under a tree, Stanley, to the chagrin of those who love him, pleads with the headmaster not to expel them. He forgives them and takes the opportunity to tell them of the love of God during their punishment session, resulting in the wild boys repenting and reforming to the surprise of all in the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Changed Lives carries a chapter on &quot;Three Brave Widows,&quot; - women who undergo the typical experiences African women have been known to face on the demise of their husbands. These three women not only lose their husbands but also at least one child each. However, their responses amidst the anguish is outstanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In traditional Africa where it is believed that people do not die natural deaths but rather, that deaths are caused, these widows refuse to give in to in-laws' demands to consult diviners to find out the causes of the deaths of their husbands (including road accidents) and to undergo cleansing.  Their Christian faith forbids it. For this, some of them are falsely accused of causing the deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They undergo great anguish as in-laws dispossess them of what property they had acquired with their late husbands. And yet they stand steadfast in their faith in God despite the tragic experiences and forgive those who wrong them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are not bitter with God for the misfortunes that have befallen them but give themselves to helping needy people in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the story of Mutakura, one sees a role model in a young man who refuses to accept bribes and displays accountability in the handling of funds. He stands firm against pressure from his parents who want to give him a girl of their choice to marry when he has a Christian girl he loves and wishes to marry. He also goes against their wishes to follow the traditional methods of marriage, commonly known as &quot;wife capture,&quot; at the cost of his parents disowning him. They later give their lives to Jesus and reconciliation follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the life of Mr Moyo, a local school teacher and peasant farmer that has stood out as being consistently godly to one writer. He helps the community around him by ploughing for the poor and sponsoring some individuals to carry out their 'O' Level studies, lives by the scriptures and not necessarily by what other Christians do for he believes in biblical backing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Moyo refuses to buy much needed and cheap goods some men come around selling because he knows they are stolen property. Unlike many Christians, during prayer sessions in public, he stands out for his short prayers, arguing that in a multitude of words, we increase the incidence of wrong words, repetition and self-centeredness in our requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wild Dominic, the village terror turned missionary, is another godly example in Changed Lives. Before his conversion, the quick tempered Dominic not only terrorised other villagers but also gave policemen a hard time when he would wreak havoc in beer gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On hearing his voice, his wife and children would scatter in all directions for fear of his terror. It was his custom to accuse his wife of some unfaithful act, and then give her a thorough beating with a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> python-skin belt. After conversion, Dominic is transformed into a loving husband and father, and becomes a Christian who does not hit back when provoked by others as was his nature before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the story of Tariro who, throughout her student life is an encouragement to others around her. Upon completion of her university education, she gets involved in community work as she looks for a job. Though quite desperate for a job, she turns down many offers on grounds of her faith because she would be required to work during worship day. Her parents are upset and her friends mock her. Finally, after a year's wait she gets a suitable job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the people in the book are actively involved in improving the well-being of members of the communities in which they live. They help those around them in practical ways and also provide material assistance. Prayer is also a vital part of their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book, containing 14 chapters, devotes the last three to stories about denominational leaders. These include Andrew Wutawunashe whose story begins with his interesting birth with a blocked windpipe. He is founder of Andrew Wutawunashe World Witness and the Worldwide Family of God Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is Mrs Gumbanjera who has the gift of praying and barren wombs are opened and demons cast out. She also has the gift of prophecy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third is a story about a bishop of African Apostolic Faith Church who died and &quot;resurrected&quot;. He too has helped many people as he prays for their conditions such as strange sicknesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is at least something that every African reader can identify with in the book for it carries stories about differently placed individuals whether young, old, male or female in diverse situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The circumstances faced by these individuals are not unique, be they bribery, handling of stolen goods, provoking situations, temptations, false accusations or conflict caused by refusal to compromise on matters of faith when it comes to marriage, sickness and death.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The World Health Organization (WHO) annual - No Tobacco Day marked on June 1 this year, coincided with a cancer awareness week observed by the Kenya Cancer Association. Acknowledging cancer as a leading killer disease, the national association hopes to increase public awareness about the various forms of cancer common in women, men and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It begins with a small lump or sore in the breast or chest of a man, a feature that one may ignore as just another painless pimple. Or it may be a slight deformity in the nipple making it appear pulled- in or sunken. Is it just an inherited deformity or pimple? Or is it one of the early signs of breast cancer - a disease that has no known cure and affecting men as well as women?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Yusuf Kodwavwala a consultant surgeon based at the private Nairobi Hospital says men in Kenya are increasingly under the threat of developing breast cancer, predominantly regarded as a disease that affects women. &quot;The disease affects men and women across the racial divides and comprises one per cent of all cancer diseases in the world. The rate in Kenya stands at six per cent, similar to Zambia and Egypt,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent lecture on cancer, Dr. Yusuf Kodwavwala demonstrated using slides the gruesome swellings, wounds and deformities that arise as a result of breast cancer, which he said is the second most common after cervical cancer. &quot;Most of our patients are diagnosed between the ages of 30 to 40 years according to figures available at the (semi-government owned) Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenya Cancer Association (KECANSA) held its first ever Cancer Awareness Week from May 27 to June 2, with various events throughout the country to increase public awareness about issues related to cancer and to support the World Health Organization (WHO) worldwide &quot;No Tobacco Day&quot; on June 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The theme of the event, Helping To Conquer Cancer, which is now a major killer in the country unlike the past when it was seen as a Western world ailment, was accompanied by free screening, seminars and lectures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to available figures from the KNH, out of reported breast cancer cases, a mind-boggling rise has been recorded in just 20 years. In 1972 a paltry 40 cases were treated, rising to 116 in 1986 and the rate now stands at a high 212 in the latest data obtained in 1992, over four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kodwavwala lists the general causes of cancer as hereditary, due to increases in fat and protein in the diet of most families as a result of high economic status and benign breast diseases like fibroadenosis. In women, he points out the danger of &quot;a late first pregnancy, lack of breast feeding or use of high hormone contraceptive pills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Treatment of cancer includes what most women have for long dreaded, and now men too, the scary and often traumatic surgery called &quot;mastectomy&quot;, which is the partial or total removal of the breast and all the underlying muscles where the cancer cells may have spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the cancer lump is not very widespread &quot;lumpectomy&quot; or removal of the lump only is successful if the cancer is detected at an early stage.  &quot;Radiation&quot; treatment is also an option where x-ray light is used repeatedly to kill the cancerous cells while &quot;chemotherapy&quot; or use of regular drug injections is an option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the help of modern technology in this field, the fear of losing one's hair during chemotherapy treatment is much reduced now than ever before and anyway the hair usually grows back quickly after the treatment is over, so women need not fear much,&quot; says Dr Kodwavwala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For breast cancer patients, the Nairobi Breast Cancer Support Group, formed in 1988, offers &quot;a safe and trusting atmosphere where they can listen to and observe each other providing new solutions to commonly shared problems and feelings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group also aims to assist in the education of women concerning breast self examination and give support for non-medical problems arising from the disease. The group meets every third Thursday evening of the month at the Nairobi Baptist Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Michael Hughes, a doctor at the cancer terminal care centre, Nairobi Hospice describes cancer as &quot;a large group of diseases characterised by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Normally the division of cells takes place in a controlled manner to repair worn-out tissues or injuries. But cancer cells grow for no reason, multiply uncontrollably destroying normal cells and spread to other parts of the body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the launching ceremony of the Cancer Awareness Week at the Mayfair Hotel in Nairobi, WHO's Regional Director for Africa Dr Paul Chuke, disclosed that there were 3.5 million cancer related deaths from developing countries in 1993 and predicts that by the year 2000 the deaths will be 4 million, up from 3 million by 1990. At 2 million, the cancer rate in women stands at almost twice that of men, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most of them are suffering from cancer of the cervix which is the number one killer in women, followed by breast cancer - which affects men as well, but at lower rates. Cancer is also a Third World problem and approximately 20 million people die from cancer annually while by the year 2015 the deaths will rise to 30 million,&quot; said Dr. Chuke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO Regional Director for Africa says that out of the 20 million, over 20 per cent can be prevented if tobacco smoking is eliminated, noting that lung cancer is caused primarily by tobacco inhalation. &quot;Through the process of downstaging - achieving earlier detection of cancer diseases by enhancing education programmes, the cure rates can be reduced to as high as 80 per cent of sicknesses in their first stages,&quot; noted the WHO Director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same function Kenya's Assistant Minister for Health Basil Criticos noted that cancer as a disease struck fear in those it afflicts and those around them. He announced that the government in conjunction with the KECANSA and other cancer research bodies are to produce a national cancer policy &quot;which will form the basis of our planning and activities on cancer for the next decade and beyond. We look forward to receiving this document before the end of this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could lead to the creation of cancer clinics at all major national hospitals, government subsidies on expensive cancer drugs and a programme for concerted public awareness similar to the high profile campaign against the incurable Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christine Ikiara, a mother of two says; &quot;It is a major improvement nowadays, unlike in the past, that during pre-natal visits, the doctor asks a woman whether she regularly checks her breasts for lumps that could lead to cancer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ikiara, however, most women either ignore any lumps they may feel in their breasts out of fear or ignorance. &quot;Even 'enlightened' women are still shy to visit their doctors for check- ups of their private parts such as pap smears for cancer of the cervix unless one is actually ill,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as put clearly by Minister Criticos: &quot;The four top killers in Kenya include skin, cervix, glands and liver cancer. The upsurge of cancer in this country is expected from the general increase of tobacco consumption, increase of industries with pollution, exposure to herbicides, pesticides, bleaching creams and lack of awareness of early signs and symptoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are more than 100 forms of cancer which occur in any tissue or organ of the body, including the blood (leukaemia) or the lymphatic system, known as lymphomas. Each cancer has its own name, form of treatment and its own chances of control and cure. The spread of cancer is called metastasis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is for the purpose to increase early detection, treatment and prevention of cancer, that KECANSA decided to launch the awareness week which is to be an annual event to compliment the association's work throughout the year. During the week, activity highlights included the launch of a booklet on cancer, conducting of free screening clinics for cancer of the cervix, breast, stomach and lungs in hospitals, publicity of patient support groups like the Breast Cancer Support Group and an open-day at the Nairobi Hospice to give public lectures. The issue of cancer in children was also highlighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dr. Leveret DeVebber, the senior medical consultant in the Paediatric and Hematology department at the KNH Ward 45 for children suffering from cancer only, the disease is rare in children compared to adults but is a leading cause of death among the young ones. &quot;Early diagnosis is particularly important as proper treatment can produce cures in most cases. In children it differs from adults in having a higher cure rate, on average 80 per cent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he lamented the high cost of anti-cancer drugs and the long period of treatment, usually two years, which must be strictly followed to achieve the high cure rates. &quot;The cost of anti-cancer drugs is far beyond the means of almost all families (we deal with) except for children under 5 years who are exempted from paying for the drugs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cytotoxic cancer drugs at the ward are very expensive with some doses priced at as much as Sh.8,000 (US dollars 138) for one dosage while the treatment thereafter could amount to as much as Sh 250,000 (US dollars 4,310), amounts beyond the reach of most patients' families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ward heavily relies on donations from individuals and charity clubs to pay for the treatment period of two years. &quot;The ideal plan for these children is for them to be &quot;adopted&quot; or sponsored for the complete treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The children are mainly affected by cancers which causes swellings of the jaw bone or glands in the neck. It can also cause tumours in the abdomen, chest and brain and spread to the bone marrow, he says. There are usually 32 children on average at the ward at any given time, although the figure may be as high as 45, requiring others to be admitted to other wards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The solid tumours are treated by surgery which is effective in the early stages, while the advanced tumours are best cured by radiotherapy treatment using x-ray light for a period of months, or the use of chemotherapy which is regular injections using the costly cytotoxic drugs. This treatment is also used to reduce the size of tumours before surgery to enhance the success rate. KECANSA and other charity organizations help in facilitating donor support for the children's cancer ward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supported entirely by donations, KECANSA has a long history of struggle against cancer in Kenya since its establishment as the Cancer Council of Kenya in the late 1960s. In 1994 when the founder Chairman Prof. Edward Kasili died, Dr Khama Rogo took over and the council was re-registered as the Kenya Cancer Association.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nyeri, Kenya - Archbishop Nicodemus Kirima of the Catholic Archdiocese of Nyeri, 120 kilometres north of the capital, Nairobi, has lamented that devil worshipping is taking root in the country &quot;because people have allowed wrongdoing to become a standard way of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop headed the Devil Worship Probe Committee appointed two years ago by President Daniel arap Moi, following numerous claims by churches in Kenya that devil worship cults were creeping into the country, particularly through schools. However, he declined to be drawn into any discussion about his probe's findings, saying it was a presidential prerogative to release the findings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Archbishop said his involvement had &quot;allowed me to find some answers to my personal questions on this matter.&quot; He denied that his hands were effectively tied until the probe report is released if at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said the Archbishop: &quot;We are preaching the doctrine everywhere. It is the antidote to this problem - be kind, be upright, love your neighbour etc.  The doctrine is clear and simple.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing as an example a recent report in a local daily, wherein a plastic bag containing blood and hair was hung from a roof and people were allowed to enter only in clean clothes, Archbishop Kirima said people in Kenya were degenerating to this level because they had allowed wrongdoing to take control of their daily lives. &quot;It all starts in small ways and grows into a big problem. If people chose to do the right things in the eyes of God, the problem would not exist,&quot; observed the prelate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 7 Archbishop Kirima delivered a captivating talk to some 2,000 people who jammed Karatina Catholic, parish some 20 kilometres from here, for night vigil prayers. He told his listeners that much of the world's wars and some diseases like the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) as well as poverty, were deliberately created by shadowy and secret societies in order to serve their evil ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked if he despaired, Archbishop Kirima told APS that he did not.  &quot;Every day, I witness so much goodness in the world - the result of so many people listening to the Word of God and doing the right things.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kigali - Rwanda's Deputy Justice Minister Mr. Gerald Gahima has hinted that his country may establish a truth commission on the lines of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) Africa Service Gahima said this approach may be the most practical way of reducing Rwanda's overwhelming case load involving more than 70,000 prisoners awaiting trial on genocide charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said his ministry had now completed a crash training programme for magistrates who are expected to start work soon. &quot;What is pending is for Parliament to approve the penalties for the various crimes committed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 500,000 people of Tutsi origin and Hutu moderates were murdered by the Interahamwe and the Rwandese Army during the period between April and August 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a decision made to use a truth commission style approach, Gahima said Rwanda's Justice Ministry would send facilitators into the prisons to explain the advantages of making full confessions in exchange for a more lenient sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said his ministry was concerned that should normal court proceedings be instituted, &quot;it would take more than five years to clear the case load.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another way to reduce the case load is to release all children who might have been involved in one way or another in the unprecedented killings that took place in Rwanda in 1994. This approach has consistently been favoured by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case load would also be substantially curtailed if people charged with damaging property had their charges reduced to civil cases. &quot;They could be allowed to carry out some sort of activity as a means of restitution to the wronged party or parties,&quot; suggested Gahima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwanda has been under intense international pressure to do something about the large number of prisoners held in terribly overcrowded prisons throughout the country. T he central African country has in turn charged that she is frustrated by the paltry international assistance to its criminal justice system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Rwandese feel painfully frustrated that the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal on Rwanda, based in Arusha, Tanzania, is proceeding very slowly and is constantly interrupted by postponements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - As the rush for mineral exploration continues to affect indigenous people all over the world, churches are concerned that some inherent and fundamental rights of these people are systematically trampled on, disregarded and violated by the dominant world neo-liberal economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a meeting organised here by the World Council of Churches (WCC), 45 representatives of indigenous nations and communities around the world raised concern about mining activities characterised by greed and profit making through transnational corporations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with APS, the executive secretary of the WCC Programme to Combat Racism, Rev. Bob Scott, said the very first suggestion for such a consultation came during a WCC team visit to Aboriginal Communities in November 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of an Aboriginal community in Cape York, Australia had earlier on voiced the need for a consultation in which indigenous groups involved in struggles against mining companies should meet to share information and devise strategies, Rev. Scott explained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the consultation last month, delegates were surprised that some transnational corporations make use of international funding institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, regional funding institutions and even the United Nations, to impose, coerce and deceive sovereign nations of their policies and programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The London meeting also condemned in the strongest terms &quot;transnational mining companies, armed with international and national organisations, and multi-lateral agreements, with the complicity of the state and their national laws - their denial of our existence, their land-grabbing, their continued destruction of our land and territories and our air and our environment, their exploitation of our resources and the continuing decimation of our people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observing that over 2 million people in Africa were engaged in small scale mining, the consultation delegates recommended that African governments should recognise the existence of these community based mining operations and give the necessary assistance to ensure more environmental friendly operations. Namibia and Ghana were represented at the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank and affiliate finance bodies who support mining companies and force African governments into this unholy alliance with multi-national companies should act more responsibly. They should also ensure that mining companies comply with the same environmental standards worldwide, the meeting recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mining codes which give undue power and economic advantage to multinational mining companies would have to be changed, so that they reflect the concerns of mine workers and communities in which mines operate, delegates stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These concerns should include health and safety standards, discriminatory wages between foreign and local workers, environmental degradation and lack of respect for indigenous people's right -- all which can be best achieved through consultation with representatives of the workers and the local communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further recommendations from the London meeting stressed that indigenous people should be consulted with comprehensive information which should be provided in a timely manner when mining activities are being considered for sites located on the people's lands. And that free and informed consent of indigenous people be obtained before any mining development can occur in indigenous people's lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation also highlighted the need for recognition of the indigenous people's inalienable rights to their lands and territories and waters, including surface and subsurface resources in accordance with, and respect for, indigenous peoples's traditional forms of collective ownership and control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indigenous people single out mining as one of the most destructive forces which they have to contend with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Labour Organization (ILO) describes mining as one of the world's most hazardous sectors, causing more than 15,000 deaths annually.  South Africa is among countries with the highest death rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other data report that the world mining industry has become disproportionately dependent on exploiting indigenous people's territory. It is estimated that by 2010, about half of the global copper and gold supply will come from indigenous people's territories.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Temperatures worldwide have shot up by about 0.4 degrees Celsius more than the average of the past 30 years, indicating the seriousness of global warming, says a study by the London-based international environment advocate, PANOS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also forecast that &quot;despite being partially masked by local pollution and occasional volcanic eruptions, there will be sufficient greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by the end of the next century to cause a worldwide temperature rise between 1.5 and 4 degrees Celsius.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, scientists are painting a gloomy picture of Africa's future as world global warming that has for long been considered by many as science fiction gradually becomes a reality. Unfortunately, there is little Africa can do to overcome the consequent dangers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the dangers that the scientists report is the effect of warm weather which they say is already extending the range of infectious tropical diseases such as river blindness, malaria, schistosomiasis, and yellow fever to areas where they are not currently endemic and where the local population has no immunities. African highlands such as Zimbabwe's capital Harare and Kenya's Nairobi, which are currently malaria-free, are set to become vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian city of Lagos, whose population the United Nations projects to swell to more than 20 million by 2015 would have its environmental hazards aggravated as migrants from the drought-hit Sahel continue to flood to coast.  With raw sewage already being discharged into the open, sea level rise, tropical storms and floods would definitely overwhelm an already unhealthy sanitary system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As these studies come to light, the North-South dispute has been generated with countries in the developing world accusing the rich countries of being the main polluters, thus urging that they reduce their emissions.  Developed countries also claim those in the South have no emission targets set for them and thus have an unfair trading advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overall global production of food and fibres, says IPCC, &quot;may not be greatly altered by a doubling of carbon dioxide levels. Provided, that is, farmers can adapt quickly to changing risks of events such as early frost and droughts, and invasions of new pests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says this bodes well for rich farmers and societies with a range of crops to choose from, but not for subsistence farmers for whom crop failure can be a matter of life and death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wheat, rice and some other major crops will be able to make more efficient use of water in an atmosphere richer in carbon dioxide. This could cause bumper crops in some places. But in others such as American Midwest, which currently supplies much of the world grain trade including famine-alleviation stocks, drought and higher temperatures could cause crop failure,&quot; says PANOS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says other crops such as sugar cane, maize and millet, gain much less from a carbon dioxide rich atmosphere. And the extra carbon dioxide will worsen conditions for grazing on rangelands by increasing the carbon content of grasses at the expense of nitrogen. This will encourage the spread of woody species, and make the grass less nutritious and tasty for many animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is disheartening about the PANOS report is the fact that cotton in Egypt might suffer from reduced water for irrigation if flow in rivers such as the Nile and the Amu Darya diminishes. IPCC warns that &quot;all such projections are very tentative but they show the range and scale of possible responses of farming systems to warming and &quot;millet, most important grain crop of many poorer communities in Africa, is also forecast to decline by about 63 to 79 per cent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe which have suffered some of the major droughts in the past 25 years, are likely to see more and worse calamities and the IPCC warns that &quot;because extremes drive rangeland systems, small changes in the frequency of extreme events may have a disproportionate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Grasslands will die and there will be an acceleration of desertification which is more likely to become irreversible if the environment becomes drier and soils become further degraded through erosion and compaction,&quot; the panel on climate change observes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK - As Nigerian authorities continue to receive worldwide condemnation over the June 4 killing of 44-year-old Kudirat Abiola, wife of the jailed Chief Moshood Abiola, a group of church leaders meeting here a week before the assassination criticized the West African country for its violation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian regime has stripped away the people's most basic human and civil rights, replacing them with violence, fear and intolerance, said the over 40 prominent church and community leaders in a communique issued at the end of the May 28 Consultation on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation, where the General Secretary of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), Rev. Jose Chipenda was the key-note speaker, was organised by the Religious Action Network Africa of the American Committee on Africa (ACA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many religious, political, trade union and community leaders have been unjustly imprisoned, forced into exile or murdered, the church leaders further said in their statement, adding that &quot;the nation's hospitals and universities, once the pride of Africa, are in runs.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing Nigeria as once a beacon of hope and pride for African people throughout the world, the church leaders lamented that &quot;this African nation has been brought low by the brutality and injustice of a military dictatorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church leaders, drawn mainly from the major African-American founded and led churches, pointed out in their communique that they were committed to the restoration of freedom and democracy in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We call on all people of good will to mark the 36th anniversary of Nigeria's independence as &quot;Nigerian Freedom Sunday&quot; on October 3, 1996, a day of prayer for the victims of oppression and dictatorship and for the return of freedom and democracy,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting a document released by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) last year, the church leaders said that &quot;our hopes for amelioration have been dashed to pieces&quot; and that the suffering of the people demands &quot;nothing short of divine intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Multi-national corporations exploit Nigeria's vast human and mineral wealth, extracting billions of dollars in profits, while Nigerian children go hungry, the church leaders stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation was held at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem and drew delegates mainly from the African Methodist Episcopal Church, African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, the Baptist Church, Church of God in Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Ethiopian Orthodox Disporic Church and the Presbyterian Church (USA). It was coordinated by Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, the president of ACA, who is also the senior pastor of the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem, New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address, Rev. Chipenda urged church leaders not to be on the side of oppression because, &quot;whenever church leaders collude with the political establishment about the distribution and exchange of power, poor people are marginalised and frustrated, they become like sheep without a shepherd.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a paper entitled: Africa's Challenge, the AACC head observed that the continental church body, national Christian councils and the African church in general are faced with the problem of how to effectively minister to a divided people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The haves on one side, and the have-nots on the other; the young on one side and the old on the other; the elite on one side and the &quot;wananchi (common man) on the other side; people living in the cities on the one side and people living in rural areas on the other side and also equally the rulers on one side and the ruled on the other side,&quot; Rev. Chipenda explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described as unfortunate the fact that in Africa, those who are rich form less than 4 per cent of the population. &quot;The middle class and their clients form 16 per cent; while the bulk of the population, made up of 80 per cent, are the poor lot.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Rev. Chipenda, the top leadership of the church is socially and economically in the lower middle class, but he stressed that &quot;it is strategically well placed because it serves as a link between the elite and the masses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This continuing temptation toward collusion of disparate interests promises to become a major challenge for the church in Africa in the coming century, said Rev. Chipenda, adding...&quot;As much as this is a collective sin, we all must confess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the Seventh AACC General Assembly to be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the Angolan clergy said of the occasion's theme - Troubled But Not Destroyed; &quot;We live in a world troubled and fractured, whose problems deserve our attention.&quot; We live at a time when the power structure, which held the world together is now disintegrating. A radically different power structure is taking form and this is happening at every single level of human life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Chipenda told the church consultation that leaders in the United States need to develop insights into changes affecting post-colonial Africa and that they should not embrace oppressive regimes, whether they are in Nigeria or the Sudan, but support for human rights, democracy and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Ambassador to the U.S. Mr Franklin Sonn, urged delegates who had &quot;played a vital role in the struggle against apartheid to continue their support for South Africa now because the great work of building a free and just society has just begun.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation recommended that church leaders represented at the gathering should write to their congregational representatives now, asking them to support continued development assistance for Africa, challenge presidential candidates on issues relating to Africa and also support freedom and democracy in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre -The junior partner in the Malawian government coalition, the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), ended its co-operation with President Bakili Muluzi's ruling United Democratic Front (UDF) party on June 2, raising fears that the pull-out might seriously handicap the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFORD leader Chakufwa Chihana, who stepped down from the post of vice president last month, said the purposes for which the 10-month-old coalition had been set had not been achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coalition was hammered out last year to consolidate democracy and bind the two parties to a coordinated parliamentary relationship after the country's three decades of autocratic rule by ex-dictator Hastings Kamuzu Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations between the two coalition partners started to cool last December when Chihana accused UDF of lacking transparency and governance, as well as engaging in high-level corruption.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four AFORD cabinet ministers have refused to resign their government posts and have been expelled from their party. These &quot;rebels&quot; will automatically become independent members of parliament until next general elections in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day before the final break, Malawi Law Society chairman James Namphambo declared that &quot;it will be a major handicap for government to the extent that it might not be good for the country,&quot; and added that &quot;the UDF government will be short of the required majority to pass bills and motions requiring a simple majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muluzi's UDF has 85 parliamentarians, which with AFORD's 35 makes a working majority which enables the easy passing of bills without much trouble from the opposition Malawi Congress Party (MCP) of Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gwanda Chakuamba, MCP's vice president said: &quot;I am afraid that Mr Muluzi's powers will be diluted or even end should AFORD pull out. It means the opposition will have the largest say in parliament. I am sorry for Muluzi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in his first reaction to the break-up on June 4, Muluzi himself welcomed the collapse of the coalition, saying that &quot;on behalf of the UDF, I accept and I am happy to see the marriage between us and AFORD end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By law, AFORD was supposed to have given a month's notice to terminate the coalition, but Muluzi hinted it could even end without those formalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No thank you. We will not force them to stay with us. It's the end of the marriage thank you,&quot; Muluzi said, adding: &quot;I'll make sure democracy is nurtured. We want peace and nobody will spoil our democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coalition's collapse leaves Muluzi's governing party four seats short of a parliamentary majority, but he promised to work with opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, Muluzi's government insisted it would continue to function effectively despite the withdrawal of its junior coalition partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government will continue to work without any problem. &quot;There are many people in AFORD who are prepared to work with us,&quot; Information and Broadcasting Minister Brown Mpinganjira said in a statement, an apparent reference to four AFORD ministers who had refused to resign and had been expelled from their party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But apart from the loss of the working majority, analysts also pointed to fears that the breakup would re-kindle tribal and regional feelings in the tiny impoverished southern African state which is split on regional and ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chihana had claimed that his party is the main unifier and that &quot;without AFORD, Malawi would slide back into chaos and confusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But now that Chihana has resigned his post of second vice-president, it is not known whether Muluzi would still maintain it in the cabinet and appoint somebody else to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition forces had called for the abolition of the post created amid controversy to accommodate Chihana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The creation of the office was an unpopular political move which can be corrected now. The position never need to have been there,&quot; said Hetherwick Ntaba, spokesman of the MCP, who pointed out that he did not expect Muluzi to fill the post in the wake of the country's ailing economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muluzi has never publicly responded to Chihana's accusations, which intensified last month when Chihana bragged that his party was the only main power broker in Malawi, and &quot;without AFORD Malawi would slide back into chaos and confusion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chihana attacked both UDF and MCP, saying they had no capacity to govern the country. They do not even have any economic conception on how to plan the future of this country,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Egyptian authorities have hanged six Muslim militants, the largest number of executions at one time since Islamic unrest erupted in 1992, in the wake of an apparent major struggle between hard-liners and moderates in the country's highest Islamic institute, police sources said on June 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six - Ahmad Abdel Azim Fawaz, 30, Huggag Gomaa Mohammad, 30, Hosni al-Sayed Hussein, 29, Zakariya Mohammad Beshir, 36, Salah Saad Mohammad, 31, and Mustafa Abdel Hamid, 29 - were from a group of 24 members of Jamaa Islamiya arrested between June and October last year for infiltrating Egypt from Sudan with a huge stockpile of weapons &quot;to commit terrorist attacks,&quot; the sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Hosni Mubarak approved the execution order against the six, who were sentenced on January 13, the sources said, adding that the hangings took place in the previous few days, without giving the exact date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Jamaa members were arrested in the southern towns of Aswan and Kom Ombo, where prosecutors said they had hidden after slipping across the border from Sudan where they had allegedly been trained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prosecutors said the militants had confessed to being trained in Sudanese camps alongside the same Jamaa members who attempted to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said the Jamaa cell was sent to Egypt by Mustafa Hamza, one of three masterminds of the Mubarak attack who Khartoum is accused of harbouring, &quot;with orders to attack important personalities and leadership figures,&quot; but police caught up with them with a massive cache of weapons, including 168 machine-guns, 95 explosives including RPG rockets and 2,500 rounds of ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twelve others in the case were given prison sentences, while six were acquitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hangings brought to 54 the number of Muslim militants executed in Egypt over the past three years, during which 76 people have been sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The executions came amid reports that conservative religious scholars who once held sway at the Al-Azhar,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the citadel of Sunni Muslim orthodoxy, were now battling to keep their influence under a new, more moderate head sheikh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Sheikh Mohmmad Sayed Tantawi took the helm of the 1,000-year-old institution in March, conservatives have opened fire on his rulings, led by the Azhar Scholars' Front (ASF) that groups around 1,000 theologians, reports said on May 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ASF has even cast doubt on Tantawi's religious credentials, targeting in particular his refusal to declare militants who carry out anti-Israel suicide bombings as being &quot;martyrs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Front insisted Tantawi's statements on the bombers were &quot;his personal opinion which cannot be considered a fatwa,&quot; or official religious decree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tantawi, who was the mufti of Egypt before becoming sheikh of Al- Zahar, often differed with his more hardline predecessor Gad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq over issues such as bank interest and circumcision of girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even while battling Tantawi, conservatives are also being hemmed in by government moves to crack down on radical clerics backing Muslim militants in their anti-state campaign which has claimed more than 1,000 lives since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They especially protest a draft law from the religious affairs ministry allowing only ministry-appointed imams to preach and a new rule requiring ministry permission to build new private mosques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are shocked by this law which threatens to bar a large number of scholars and imams from conducting their duty of preaching,&quot; an ASF statement said, warning that the law could cause &quot;unrest which would go beyond any unrest in the past,&quot; referring to the militants' armed campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Front's violent reaction shows the high stakes in the game. A preacher without mosque loses all influence since access to the media is restricted,&quot; said Nabil Abdel Fattah, a researcher at Al-Ahram Centre or Strategic Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abdel Fattah said Azhar scholars had become more radical during the 1980s, especially after the secret distribution of a booklet by Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, spiritual leader of the militant Jamaa Islamiyaa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Entitled; God is great, the Sheikh of Al-Azhar must resign, the booklet cast doubt on the institution's legitimacy and found favour among some scholars who felt Al-Azhar had become too much a religious &quot;rubber stamp&quot; for the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the Azhar information office, Sayed Askar, was among 54 members of the Muslim Brotherhood sentenced for to up to five years in prison last November for membership in the banned fundamentalist group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Religious Affairs Ministry runs 34,000 mosques and plans to take over another 20,000 private ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conservative movement sees itself threatened by Tantawi's attempts to use the mobilization against Islamic radicals to bring the moderate trend into dominance,&quot; Abdel Fattah said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> N'djamena - Chadian President Idriss Deby took first place in his country's first-ever presidential elections with nearly 48 per cent of the vote, but a second round poll will be held on June 23, during which he will be opposed by veteran southern politician Abdulkader Wadal Kamougue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Preliminary results from Chad's independent election commission put the incumbent well ahead of Kamougue, a veteran government minister, who polled 11 per cent of the votes cast in the June 2 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other opposition leaders, Saleh Kebzabo and Jean Bayoweu Alingue, trailed with 8.5 and eight per cent respectively, followed by former national assembly speaker Lol Mahmat Choa with 5.6 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten other candidates shared less than eight per cent of the votes cast, with none of them managing better than two per cent in the poll which opposition parties refused to accept, but which the 100-odd foreign observers expressed satisfaction at the way it was carried out and spoke of only minor problems unlikely to affect the result.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a joint press conference here on June 6, the 14 candidates who stood against Deby said the vote &quot;was marked by many irregularities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The regime is engaging in a thousand and one manipulations to rig the outcome,&quot; they said in a joint statement which complained of &quot;intimidation of militants of other parties, removal of ballot boxes, arrests and fraud.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kamougue has challenged the validity of the first round result in which Deby was credited with 48 per cent against 11 per cent for himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the electoral commission said the results were drawn from all the former French colony in central Africa as well as polling stations for Chadians living abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provisional for the moment, the figures are to be declared official by the court of appeal in N'Djamena in the coming days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The turnout rate was 76 per cent, with 2.7 million out of 3.5 million eligible voters taking part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because no one candidate got a clear majority, a second round was scheduled for June 23, pitting Deby against Kamougue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In preparations for the second round presidential run-off against southerner Kamougue, Deby pledged on June 9 that it would be &quot;totally open&quot; and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kamougue is a man who knows politics and he is a patriot,&quot; Deby said in a statement, adding that he hoped Kamougue would &quot;rise above all other considerations to allow democracy to triumph and make sure Chad does not return to its former deplorable situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remark was apparently an allusion to 20 years of civil war marked by numerous regional rebellions and also to the fact that Kamougue drew most of his support from the mainly Christian south-west, while the Muslims in central and eastern Chad gave their votes to Deby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president said he hoped the 13 other candidates would &quot;accept the rules of democracy in which there is a winner and a loser and that they will accept the verdict of the ballot box.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement issued the same day, Kamougue had called the result of the first round &quot;a political hold-up&quot; and vowed to &quot;bring legal action to have the poll invalidated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deby had campaigned for support to complete the task of consolidating multi-party democracy in this destitute north African country of six million people, which has been wrecked by civil war since independence from France in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Multiparty politics were introduced in October 1991, with a national conference in April 1993 promulgating a transitional period towards democracy. But since the national conference brought in a multi-party system, Chad has been stuck in a transitional period that keeps extending, with a transitional council acting as a provisional parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a referendum late March, Chadians approved their first democratic constitution, which provides for a presidential-style system of government.  The presidential elections were intended to establish stable, lasting political institutions. Legislative elections are due later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deby declared himself president in December 1990, a month after he marched into the capital with his rebel Popular Salvation Movement and ousted Hissene Habre, who fled to Cameroon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - Thousands of civilian population continued to flee western Liberia in the past two weeks to escape renewed clashes between the country's warring armed factions, witnesses arriving here said on June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no law and order. Everything is just chaos,&quot; said Morris Kiade, one of hundreds of refugees who arrived by canoe from Grand Cape Mount county, where fighting is continuing between the two wings of the ethnically-divided United Liberation Movement (ULIMO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the canoes reportedly capsized on the way to the capital. One witness, Boimu Fumnbah, said up to 15 people from one canoe may have drowned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People are suffering from bullet wounds and there is nobody to care for them,&quot; Kiade told journalists at Monrovia's Banjor Beach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Residents in affected areas are &quot;completely out of food and there is no medicine to treat the wounded and sick,&quot; said Kiade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our people are dying in the bushes. We have never enjoyed peace since (the African peacekeeping force) ECOMOG withdrew from the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peacekeepers pulled out of Grand Cape Mount county last March after clashes with the ethnic Krahn wing of ULIMO-Krahn in Tubmanburg, in nearby Bomi county, left at least 20 ECOMOG troops dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only road to the western region has since been closed to normal traffic and relief convoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a ceasefire has held in the capital itself since May 26, after almost two months of factional fighting, banditry and armed robbery are still common in many areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere, gunmen killed a Protestant pastor during a looting spree in a Monrovia suburb, as fighting between rival militiamen resumed in the Liberian capital, police said on June 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evan Pittman, founder of the Children's Salvation Ministry Church, was killed instantly when he was shot in the head while trying to rescue neighbours from armed looters late on June 5 in the Bardnersville suburb, police said, quoting witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The killing took place as more than 10 gunmen looted and shot sporadically in the area, which for years has had a reputation for banditry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pittman was a well-known figure in Monrovia, but was not politically outspoken and his death was not thought to have been premeditated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police say they are investigating the incident, but no arrests had been made by the afternoon of June 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bardnersville residents, who already run neighbourhood watch schemes because of the insecurity, have called on the African peacekeeping force ECOMOG to deploy in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 8, a group of unidentified fighters armed with machetes raided the government-run John Kennedy Memorial hospital in the eastern Sinkor district, and threatened health workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although no one was hurt in the incident, it was the third such attack in two months, according to hospital administrator Henry Marvuie, who warned that &quot;a repeat of such behaviour would lead to the closure of the hospital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 9, police announced the arrest of 12 alleged armed robbers on Bushrod island and the seizure of three AK-47 rifles, as well as video decks, a satellite dish and television sets, but said that the ringleader of the armed gang, Junior Sonpon and three others, were still at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Liberian rebels crossed into the Ivory Coast and killed 14 people and wounded four others, Ivorian police in Guiglo, 400 kilometres northwest of Abidjan, said on June 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four wounded in the fighting, which took place on June 7, were in serious condition and taken to a nearby hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incidents were in the border village of Basobli, near Toulepleu, in Guiglo district, and were carried out by the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) of Charles Taylor, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said a column of Liberian rebels had fired on Ivory Coast policemen after they had been called on to stop. The police, who lacked ammunition and resources, fell back without losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 14 casualties were six Ivorian women, six Liberian women, an 18- year-old youth and a baby, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attackers, who had also set fire to village huts, succeeded in escaping after Ivory Coast police returned with reinforcements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incidents came in the wake arrival in the Liberian capital on June 9 of a delegation from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), headed by Captain Kojo Tsikata, security advisor to Ghanaian President and ECOWAS Chairman Jerry Rawlings, which was expected to start meeting faction Liberian leaders from June 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although some differences still needed to be resolved, &quot;the factions have reaffirmed their commitment&quot; to a peace accord signed in Abuja last August by all factions in Liberia's civil war, ECOMOG Commander General John Inienger told the delegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One impediment to stability is the refusal, despite the demands of international mediators and the interim council of state, of ethnic Krahn fighters to leave the Barclay Training Centre, a downtown barracks that served as the Krahn's stronghold during the clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Krahns rejected offers of evacuation to rural areas, claiming those proposed, previously under the Krahns' control, were now occupied by enemy fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, &quot;all sides have shown their willingness to abide by the ceasefire which ended seven weeks of fighting,&quot; Inienger told the ECOWAS team.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) has recorded a 3,800 tonne increase in copper production over its projected May output.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a ZCCM press statement released in Lusaka yesterday, the increase in production of finished copper has been attributed to the improved performance of the com-pany's two smelters in general and Nkana in particular.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company overshot its estimated May target of 24,833 tonnes with a recorded production of 28,730 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a 5 tonne increase in finished cobalt production for May was recorded with the production figures standing at 449 tonnes against the company's estimated 444 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The company is forecasting that the first quarter results in finished copper production (April, May and June) for the 1996/97 financial year will be above target by approximately 4,000 tonnes at about 82,800 as against the company's own official estimate at 78,600,&quot; the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZCCM has further announced that it has resolved the problem of low grade ore production at the Nchanga Open Pit Mine which had affected the grade of Cobalt concentrate in April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increase in metallurgical recoveries in general and at the metallurgical plants at Nchanga Division in particular were also cited as having contributed to the rise in production of both the copper and cobalt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia are trialing (0-2) having lost the first match played in Khartoum, Sudan last Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poulsen, speaking in an interview said the chances of winning were there especially with the arrival of team captain, Kalusha Bwalya, who features for Club America in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Great Kalu' , as he is fondly known by most adoring Zambians, joined the squad yesterday and begun training with the others in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We definitely need to win this match at all cost to advance to the next round and the players seem prepared to deliver the goods this Sunday,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The coach, relaxing at his Makeni home explained that Zambia played under pressure in the first match because of the hot weather and bumpy playing field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''You watched the match back home and saw we had problems with the playing field. But that is no an excuse,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Poulsen took over the re-building of the team in 1993, Zambia has reached the Africa Cup of Nations finals twice except for the time when Briton Ian Porterfield ''temporaly'' took over affairs of the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last January Poulse took the team to South Africa for the Nations tournament and they displayed another a colourful performance and finished a better third to South Africa and Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team is now rated first in Africa on the Federation of International Football Associations FIFA panel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zairean government has gone mum over requests from Zambia that the two countries hold urgent discussions over matters critical to the welfare of their nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Copperbelt Deputy Minister, Charles Museba, disclosed in the commercial city of Ndola that his administration had in recent weeks sent five urgent reminders to the Governor of the Zairean province of Shaba about the need to hold a meeting between them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But so there has been no responce whatsoever either from the provincial capital of Lubumbashi or Kinshasa itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Museba explained that what Zambia desires most is for the convening of the 17th session of the Zambia-Zaire Joint Permanent Commission anywhere in Zaire so it can look at outstanding issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia is particularly concerned with the increased incidents of harrassment of its nationals travelling from Mansa in Luapula to Mufulira or vice-versa, using the pedicle road which is a stretch of gravel road linking both towns through Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition Zambia is unhappy with the prevalence of banditry and petty thieving in such border towns as Ndola, Mufulira and Chililabombwe by armed men from Zaire who are suspected to be renegade soldiers of that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also the Zambian government would have raised the issue of a heavy influx of Zairean illegal immigrants who in recent months have made the work of Immigration officers on the Copperbelt a little bit more complicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Museba says according to an agreement reached at the last meeting of the Joint Permanent Commission which was held in Ndola, this session should have been hosted by Zaire and that was why Zambia was anxious to see it take off the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But so far Zambia has met negative responces from the other side of the border, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - University of Zambia Students Union (UNZASU) vice-president, Joseph Munsanje has gone missing, friends, family and union colleagues disclosed in interviews yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And armed plain clothes police officers are said to have been hunting for him in connection with the interviews he gave to foreign journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNZASU president, Emmanuel Tembo, on Thursday said Munsanje was last seen at the campus on Sunday before three armed police officers in plain clothes stealthily, without notifying the security officers at the university, went to his room but did not find him for he was out studying.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo said the three, who included a lady, then went to his girlfriend's room with a view of finding him there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted yesterday Munsanje's girlfriend, a third year psychology student who asked not to be named, said the three officers went to her room around midnight on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munsanje's girlfriend said she had noticed that the three had been following her that night on her way from her studies and she only opened for them when the lady called her by her name, they then demanded to know where Munsanje was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On my way from studies I noticed that three people were following me, later I heard a knock on the door and I only opened for them when the lady called out my name,&quot; she said. &quot;They then identified themselves as detectives and wanted to know where Munsanje was but I did not tell them because I had no idea.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She identified one of them, who was brandishing a pistol, as detective Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Security personnel at the campus said the three had not passed through their office as was the procedure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Munsanje's family are wondering what could have happened to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't know where he is and what is worrying us is why the police have been following him especially at awkward hours,&quot; said Dr Moono Munsanje, a brother to Joseph who travelled from Luanshya on Tuesday when he got the news that the brother was missing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police spokesman, Francis Musonda, yesterday said as far as he was concerned no student was facing any arrest and wondered what the detectives could have been looking for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By yesterday Munsanje's whereabouts had not been known despite exams having commenced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia's opponents in this Sunday's World Cup qualifier Sudan were on Tuesday held to a 0-0 draw by Taifa Stars in an international friendly played in Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) radio's Fast Track sports programme, the two sides, both preparing for the World Cup, failed to score in the match .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And officials at the Ministry of Sport have announced that a 30-man Sudanese national soccer delegation arrives in Lusaka this afternoon for the crucial match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have confirmed that they are flying in tomorrow (today) aboard an Aero Zambia plane at 17:15 hours and we will today get in touch with FAZ to see which hotel we can book them in,&quot; an official said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Italian ambassador to Zambia, Dr Magherita Costa, yesterday requested Works and Supply minister Patrick Kafumukache to give road construction projects to her government because it knows the job better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a handover ceremony of three tractors, two vacuum tankers, two tractor trailers and Fiat tractor spares to Kafumukache in Lusaka yesterday, Dr Costa said Zambian should take advantage of the Italian government's expertise in road building.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must not forget that Italians are the heirs of the ancient Romans and Via Appia, Via Aureria and Via Cassia were the first ways of communication realised in the world,&quot; Dr Costa said. &quot;Those roads still exist and, I assure you they can compete with the modern highways.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Costa was hopeful that Italy would soon be called upon to build new roads and upgrade the old ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could even start today,&quot; she said. &quot;Machinery is already here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kafumukache, without committing himself on road construction contracts with the ambassador, said he hoped Italy would continue helping Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Donors do not need the opposition to influence them into making any aid cuts to Zambia because their decisions are caused by the failure of the MMD government to honour its commitment to them on good governance, claimed UNIP publicity secretary Bweendo Mulengela yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulengela told a press conference at UNIP's Freedom House head quarters in Lusaka yesterday that it was childish for the MMD to imagine UNIP can influence the independent stand of the donors who are ably represented here and can assess things on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulengela said in 1994 finance minister Ronald Penza, the then National Commission for Development Planning deputy minister Dean Mung'omba and former health minister Boniface Kawimbe, upon return from a donor meeting told the nation of the set conditions for the aid they had agreed to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why should they turn around and say that us in UNIP are so intelligent and persuasive as to turn the donor community against them?&quot; Mulengela asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is the fault of the MMD that the donors have turned against them since they have failed to comply with the set donor aid conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain, the United States, Japan, France and Norway have so far indicated an inclination to freeze any new aid to Zambia &quot;until good governance is restored&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We feel the assurances given to us by the Zambian delegation at the last consultative meeting in London about this government's commitment to have a consensus based constitution have not been met,&quot; Norwegian Charge de Affairs, Thorbjorn Gaustadsaether, said in an earlier interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Foreign Affairs minister, Christon Tembo, had told reporters that &quot;donors felt the amendment to the Constitution was intended to eliminate UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda from the presidential race&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulengela said in the past, MMD had alleged that president Kaunda's return to power would scare away investors but circumstances are such that the investors are now running away from them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Indicators are that as long as MMD leads no-one will be interested in investing in Zambia,&quot; Mulengela charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further warned MMD not to fight donors unless they had the right cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We reiterate further our call to the Commonwealth and Frontline States to shun this unfortunate government for the Zambians,&quot; Mulengela appealed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The government should think of the state of the economy when it makes decisions, advised Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) chairman Mark O'Donnell in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The economy must be number one on the agenda,&quot; O'Donnell said.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surely what matters is that people have a healthy diet, are driving on good roads and are getting better education instead of always concentrating on politics.  Government should address relevant issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Donnell pointed out that Zambia, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of under US$3 billion, was operating under capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It means the economy is continually sliding and we are not producing anything. The economy of Zambia is very sick,&quot; he said. &quot; If the downward slide is not halted there will be further loss of jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Donnel was, however, happy that the government was taking some positive steps in the right direction on import duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has reduced import duty on some materials such as label paper from 15 to five per cent,&quot; O'Donnel said. &quot;As a country, we import ready-made packaging materials from Zimbabwe instead of creating our own packaging for Zambian products simply because of the high duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the only way to get the economy to boom was to get duty off materials. Pointing to the label paper, he said this improvement in the sub-sector would benefit a lot of other sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Industries in the export sector which needs attractive packaging would benefit if we had our own packaging industry,&quot; O'Donnell said.&quot;This is what should be happening,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commerce ministry permanent secretary, Kabeta Muleya, assured the government was doing everything possible to resuscitate the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government is working with the manufacturers to improve the economy,&quot; Muleya said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zambia national soccer team has been a surprise team full of contradictions. They win when everyone doubts them and lose when everyone expects a win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have come to realise fame and immense self confidence have not been the cup of tea of most of our players. It over runs them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team's defeat at the hands of Tunisia in the last Africa cup of nations tournament was to many as much a shock as the 4 goal blitz past the tough Egyptians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the Egyptians, by far a superior side to the then rebuilt youthful and untested Zambian squad, would fall that easily to Zambia, did not only shock us but excite our hopes about an easier run over Tunisia. In both cases the unexpected happened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia unexpectedly again lost to Sudan but will still do what some may not expect - maul the Sudanese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia may historically have had a tough time against Sudan but few Zambians (I am sure not even the team itself) expected that these men from cartoon or is it Khartoum, with their ancient football, played in the air with the speed of an aboriginal hunter, would overcome the mighty skill of our tested men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I however, appreciate the frustration of playing amateurs running about in all directions and cheered in their confusion by a religiously partisan crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What skill is appreciable in the Sudanese team apart from heavy running around and wild kicking? These are men who have never known modern competition and football and who must not be allowed to ruin Africa's world cup chances by moving a step ahead at the expense of quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no reason to look at this game from the Zambian point, Africa must raise a team to make a difference in world football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I could have been of any other nationality but would never have said Sudan in its form is a team for Africa's soccer leadership. Much as I would have a lot to say about the level of our own preparations, I still feel the Zambian camp has a better deal to offer Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan must for this reason be mutilated this Sunday and be helped to appreciate a few lessons that will polish their no-style football before Africa suffers more humiliation in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soccer, dear Sudan, is not just running like a windmill or it would have long ceased to be entertainment. Cool down and learn a few things about coordination, building a system, passes and launching an attack that will make you leave the pitch this Sunday with substantial energy but quite a basket full of goals against you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Victory in Sunday's game is expected but that is not the issue. What is the issue is how many goals are fair for Sudan and safe to forestall Africa's reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a good thing that all key players like Kalusha and Johnson Bwalya have returned home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zambia two goals is not a margin. We have no difficulty raking in four goals in less than 50 minutes so Sudan may well be lucky getting away with the unexpected of just about three goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sorry I ought to have been more courteous and recognised your presence here - Welcome home Sudan!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Western donors have deplored moves by the Zambian government of Frederick Chiluba to prevent his rivals from taking part in October's elections. But South Africa is pursuing a foreign policy of quiet, if not silent, diplomacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the debt the ANC feels towards Zambia's former president Kenneth Kaunda for sheltering the movement during apartheid is apparently not enough to condemn efforts to disqualify him from running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo says that Pretoria does not want to take the lead, preferring instead to leave it to Botswana President Quett Masire, who is also the head of the Southern African Development Community (SADC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Masire is doing very little and the regional body is appearing spineless as one of its members nakedly flouts the regional trend towards democratisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After telling foreign correspondents at a lunch on June 7 that South Africa's foreign policy priorities include promoting human rights and keeping the peace in the region, Nzo lamented the &quot;tragedy&quot; occurring in Zambia which he said could lead to conflict there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he insisted: &quot;It is up to the chairman of SADC to respond ... South Africa is not a global power nor does it seek to be a dominating force in the region. We have made it clear we see ourselves as a nation among equals in the sub-region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pressed further, Nzo said masire was considering convening a meeting of regional officials to discuss Zambia, but that no other action was being considered for the time being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda said in a telephone interview that a recent visit to Lusaka by Masire was a &quot;disaster&quot; in terms of persuading Chiluba to reverse his non-democratic path. Kaunda said he would have liked a telephone call from his old friend, Nzo. But he expressed some sympathy for South Africa's reluctance to get too involved, saying: &quot;I can well understand their position. The government here thinks they (the South African government) are too close to me. So that's why they left it to President Masire and SADC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SADC's passivity is in sharp contrast to 1994, when member states including South Africa threatened to intervene in Lesotho after the palace coup and in Mozambique after former rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama initially rejected his electoral defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambian silence follows South Africa's withdrawing its tough stance on Nigeria after failing to muster regional support last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign donors, including Britain, the United States, the Netherlands and several Scandinavian countries, have threatened an aid freeze over the constitutional amendments passed by the Zambian Parliament last month which disqualify as presidential candidates, traditional chiefs, people who lived abroad for the past 20 years, or anyone who is not at least a second-generation Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This not only rules out Kaunda, whose parents were immigrants from Malawi, but also his United National Independence Party deputy chief Inyambo Yeta, and Zambian Democratic Congress leader Dean Mungomba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further concern has been raised over a charge of treason against nine political opponents, including Yeta and other senior Kaunda aides, for allegedly forming part of a shadowy group called &quot;Black Mamba&quot; which the government blames for recent bomb attacks. Kaunda denies any link.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda will not quietly accept the role of sidelined senior statesman and has threatened civil disobedience, such as staging unauthorised rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chiluba government was clearly worried that a deteriorating economic situation could facilitate a comeback for Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda left office after being overwhelmingly defeated by Chiluba in the country's first democratic elections in 1991, chastened by a popular rejection of his economic mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's adoption of donor-dictated austerity measures have worsened life for many Zambians who now look back nostalgically on the days of free education, food subsidies and state-protected jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western diplomats say that, ironically, Chiluba would probably have won the elections without thwarting his rivals. Now, however, he has eroded his credibility and elevated in popular esteem Kaunda, who was certainly no democrat during his 27-year reign as Zambia's first post-independence president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - South African Minister of Trade and Industry Alec Erwin is pressing for an early resolution of the trade dispute that has soured relations with Zimbabwe -- South Africa's most important regional market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erwin brought a 25-strong delegation that included industrialists and trade unionists to one-day talks hosted by his Zimbabwean counterpart, Nathan Shamuyarira, at Victoria Falls on Monday</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks were aimed at defusing an increasingly acrimonious row over terms of trade which have recently threatened to get out of hand. Zimbabwean industrialists called for a &quot;trade war&quot; if South Africa refused to remove obstructive tariffs on Zimbabwean goods. President Robert Mugabe recently adopted similar fighting talk at an economic forum in Cape Town.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Erwin is determined to find solutions, sources in the South African delegation said. &quot;He agreed there was a lack of balance in the present situation and communicated a willingness to resolve differences,&quot; said one delegate, who was impressed by the new minister's command of detail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But significant obstacles remain. Zimbabwe is hoping to revive preferential access to the South African market as provided for in the 1964 trade agreement between the two countries which lapsed in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africans, however, conscious of World Trade Organisation rules that bar bilateral pacts, are anxious to focus on a wider range of issues that will free trade in the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't want negotiations with Zimbabwe to be out of step with what we might achieve later at the regional level,&quot; said South African high commissioner Kingsley Mamabolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Present at the Victoria Falls talks were leading members of the steel and engineering industries' federation, textiles manufacturers and<BR>representatives of the Food and Allied Workers' Union, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, the National Union of Mineworkers and the South African Textile Workers' Union. They met their Zimbabwean counterparts in bilateral talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, three working groups have been formed to look at the three main problem areas: textiles and clothing, agricultural produce and other sectors such as minerals and leather products and the motor industry. They are due to report back at a meeting in South Africa at the end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The formation of the working groups &quot;demonstrated seriousness on the part of the South African and Zimbabwean governments,&quot; said Mamabolo who spoke of a new sense of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's textiles industry is on the verge of collapse since South Africa, partly at the insistence of trade unions, made access to its market prohibitive. Beef and poultry producers have also been hard hit while local manufacturers complain that Pretoria's export incentives encourage South African companies to flood the Zimbabwean market with cut-price goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress in talks will depend on local-content monitoring. The South Africans complain that Zimbabwe includes items imported from the Far East in its manufactured goods. While South African manufacturers want goods entering South Africa to contain no less than 75% local content to qualify for tariff reductions, Zimbabwe would prefer the figure to be closer to 25%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting saw a South African proposal for a local-content sliding scale that would increase annually. But such a scheme would be difficult to monitor, observers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there is a clear willingness to make progress, several hurdles remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economists point to the influence of trade unions in South African policy making. The Congress of South African Trade Unions believes neighbouring countries exploit cheap labour. This explains in part their inflexibility regarding textiles imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But their presence has had at least one positive result. Zimbabwean trade unionists, mostly marginalised by their government in the past, are delighted to be sitting at the top table in the current negotiations, unthinkable a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zimbabwe is having to learn the politics of inclusivity,&quot; one delegate said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers have said Erwin got on well with Shamuyarira despite the Zimbabwean minister's adherence over many years to the Pan Africanist Congress. &quot;It is irrelevant,&quot; said one diplomat attending the talks. &quot;The politicians got on well. Everything now depends on the other players.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Soweto 1976 was the first big news story that dropped into the laps of the South African Broadcasting Corporation's fledgling television service. But the corporation's efforts at covering the uprising are lost to history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SABC never kept recordings of its early TV news bulletins, and all that survives in the archives is a random selection of unedited footage. Most of it is a catalogue of burnt-out buildings and cars with smashed windows, indicating that reporters had missed out on some of the action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are clues to how the SABC tried to get close to the story -- they hitched rides with the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one telling piece of footage, a camera looks over the shoulder of a policeman who crouches in the back of a speeding van, his bayonet silhouetted against the light as he fires at an unseen target. Such records speak of an SABC which had not yet lost its innocence -- a few years later, the camera crews knew very well where they weren't supposed to look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And with innocence comes fun, as can be seen in one delightful shot of a policeman dozing on the grass, and then jumping up in embarrassment as he realises the camera is on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Radio news bulletins from the period have also disappeared, though the recorded inserts survive and give an indication of the corporation's priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Always keen to give an ear to black voices, the SABC recorded the views of homeland leaders Lucas Mangope of Boputhatswana, Gatsha (as he was then known) Buthelezi of KwaZulu and Cedric Pathudi of Lebowa, none of whom thought the riots were a good idea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither did &quot;well-known black writer and inhabitant of Soweto&quot; Credo Mutwa, who said &quot;this thing has been started on the flimsiest of excuses&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the then-prime minister, BJ Vorster, was there telling us the events in Soweto were &quot;a deliberate attempt to bring about polarisation between whites and blacks&quot;. He reassured listeners that &quot;instructions have been given to maintain law and order at all costs&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Gabu Tugwana (he was known as Jan at the time,) was working on retainer for the Rand Daily Mail at the time of the June 1976 uprising. It was he and his colleague Nat Sechake who brought first-hand accounts of events to Mail readers, and he was detained by the police for his efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His application form for a permanent post at the Mail was delivered to him while he sat in the cells. That launched him on a journalistic career which continues 20 years later as editor of the New Nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when some white journalists stayed out of the townships fearing attacks, or were barred by the police, black journalists were at a unique advantage. They could slip past the police lines looking like ordinary commuters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newspapers which had attached little value to black journalists were hard-pressed to find enough of them to cover the events unfolding in the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail called in and promoted its freelancers. The Star relied on staff from its black sister paper The World. Beeld's front page on June 17 1976 includes a testimony by one David Sithole, who is identified simply as a &quot;werknemer&quot; (employee) of Beeld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raymond Louw, who was then editor of the Rand Daily Mail, describes 1976 as &quot;the coming of age of black journalism. Their reports dominated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not all of the black journalists concerned speak about the era with such warmth. Tugwana recalls the disbelief with which editors greeted the testimony of black reporters fresh from the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One night I knew about an impending attack. I hid in a coal box. I heard a military vehicle and someone speaking through a loudhailer, saying: 'Don't destroy these houses, destroy everyone inside the houses.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The next day I went through such a grilling at the office. They asked me: 'Are you sure you heard those exact words?'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tugwana was arrested at Orlando High School after the police allowed him to drive into the school. &quot;They said, 'This is a big fish', and I was detained for three and a half months under the Internal Security Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peter Magubane, the Mail photographer whose records of the period have become legendary, remembers: &quot;I had my nose broken by a police captain in Alexandra. But what was most hurtful was when they ordered me to take out my film and expose it to the light. I lost historic images.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While some journalists were injured or threatened by students, Magubane says he had no difficulty in persuading demonstrating students that his photographs would help to publicise their struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magubane scoffs at the received wisdom among white journalists that it was dangerous for them to go into the townships: &quot;Whites were frightened because of apartheid. They didn't want to go into the townships.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carol Lazar, then a junior reporter on the Mail, agrees the threat to white journalists was exaggerated: &quot;We felt safer among the people than among the police.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the reasons, the situation called for creative ways of reporting. Harvey Tyson, then editor of The Star, speaks of the difficulty of having no single credible source of information, with official reports toning down the violence and the students making no effort to communicate their version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rand Daily Mail team, in particular, came up with some ingenious ways of getting the story out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We totally disregarded police restrictions, or found ways around them,&quot; says Lazar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She recalls how she and her colleagues donned hospital overalls and hid for days in Baragwanath Hospital, counting the dead and injured to provide an alternative to the sanitised official reports. Friendly doctors provided cover for them and even donated their vouchers for the canteen -- had the hospital authorities known of their presence, the journalists would have been expelled or arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mervyn Rees, the Mail's crime reporter at the time, spent June 16 and the two following days hiding out in the house of a priest opposite Orlando police station, counting the bodies brought in in the police vans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Mail innovation -- a home-made riot-proof vehicle -- was less successful, usually ending up with punctured tyres in the middle of the battle zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all the ingenuity, both Louw and Tyson speak of the difficulty of providing anything beyond an episodic view of the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no other way of covering a breaking story,&quot; Tyson says. &quot;We turned out six or seven editions in seven hours. In a perfect world it wouldn't get much better than that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It took two or three days before the significance started to percolate into our minds,&quot; Louw says. &quot;And there was no sense of the historical importance the events would assume.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Soweto riot&quot; read The Star's banner headline on the afternoon of June 16 1976. It was followed by a mere four paragraphs -- all the paper could scrape together before deadline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At least one child was shot as about 300 police fired hundreds of shots into the air as they tried to quell a riot involving more than 10 000 Soweto high school pupils today,&quot; the story began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Underneath, a late flash informed readers of the first two deaths.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story pushed aside the first edition's lead, which was about tensions brewing between Rhodesia and Botswana over the shooting of a Motswana cattle- herder who had wandered over the Rhodesian border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the story which ran over the following days eclipsed the story which had been big earlier in the week: one concerning the impending meeting between the then-prime minister, BJ Vorster, and Henry Kissinger, the then-US secretary of state, in Bonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That first interpretation of the events -- the police were just doing their job -- was quickly discredited. But the &quot;Soweto riot&quot; headline became a label for one of the defining moments in South African history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time The Star brought out its first city late edition, the headline was &quot;Six die in riots&quot;. The story was sourced to hospital and ambulance officials, and a confused South African Police Brigadier R le Roux, who was quoted as saying &quot;everything is in such an upheaval here, I really don't know what is going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later came the first eyewitness reports, and a photograph which was to become an icon of apartheid repression: two pupils carrying the lifeless body of a third pupil -- only the next day was he identified as Hector Petersen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of the day the headlines were running scared. &quot;Mobs take over&quot; was splashed across the top of the page, with individual stories headed &quot;25 dead and count may rise&quot;, &quot;Rioters storm hospital&quot;, and &quot;Drunken Tsotsis on prowl&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But readers who bothered to turn past the horrors of the front page found a report that pieced together the sequence of events which had sparked the riots -- and found the police to be at fault. Pupils only began throwing stones after a police officer had thrown a teargas cannister into the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next morning, the Rand Daily Mail had its share of horror news in the lead (&quot;bands of maurauding blacks rampaged through Soweto last night&quot;), balanced by a front-page editorial lambasting the government for its failure to forsee the inevitable. Eyewitness reports with the bylines of Jan Tugwana and Nat Serache were pushed onto page five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World, aimed at black readers but owned by the Argus company, was no less guarded than the white newspapers. It was a World journalist, Sophie Thema, who provided the first eyewitness account of the start of the riots accusing the police of provoking the violence by throwing a teargas cannister into the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Thema's report came with the proviso &quot;according to Miss Thema's eyewitness account&quot;, suggesting a lack of editorial trust in what Thema saw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Editor Percy Qoboza resorted to innuendo when he suggested a way out of the crisis. His editorial dismissed as irrelevant the talks between the West Rand Administration Board and the Urban Bantu Council, suggesting &quot;what one needs to do is to talk to people who the students have confidence in.&quot; The tantalising implication was that the people the students had confidence in could neither be named nor quoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beeld was the most blunt of all: &quot;Hell in Soweto&quot; read the headline, with a photo of the dead body of Dr Mellville Edelstein -- a government employee killed in the riots -- across the width of the page. Die Transvaler ran with &quot;Shock violence -- whites chopped to death&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beeld had tracked down Andries Treurnicht, then deputy minister of bantu administration, in Windhoek, and ran an interview. &quot;In the white part of South Africa,&quot; Treurnicht proclaimed (meaning anything that wasn't a homeland) &quot;where the government erects buildings, gives subsidies and pays the teachers, it is surely our right to determine the language arrangements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Beeld defied stereotypes about the Afrikaans press with the damning editorial comment: &quot;Has our government really no more effective weapon than bullets against children who are running amok?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beeld also came up with the only photograph of Winnie Mandela on June 16, explaining in the caption that she had been trying to persuade the children not to demonstrate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the start, stories in the English press emphasised the riots had been sparked by the policy of giving Afrikaans equal status to English as a medium of instruction in black schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Afrikaans papers placed the language issue low down in their stories, but squared up to it in their editorials. Beeld said the language issue ought to be a matter for negotiation, but &quot;the bullets in Soweto have placed it outside the realm of argument&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A front-page editorial in Die Transvaler ventured to suggest the real problem was there were not enough Afrikaans-speaking teachers in black schools, but insisted &quot;after order is restored as a first priority, more negotiations over language rules are essential&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Sunday, Rapport was more forthright: &quot;Scrap the language provisions in Bantu education. What Afrikaner would want to fight with blacks because they don't want to use his language?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The comment echoed remarks by prominent Afrikaans intellectuals quoted in English and Afrikaans papers, who compared the government attempts to force Afrikaans on black pupils to Lord Milner's imposition of English on Afrikaners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took the Rand Daily Mail to question the importance of Afrikaans in the whole affair. &quot;It was a protest against subservience,&quot; read the Mail's front-page editorial on June 17. &quot;The manifest enemy may have been Afrikaans, but the real target was white domination and racial injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The destablisation of higher education campuses has triggered the personal intervention of President Nelson Mandela, who is known to be extremely concerned about the ongoing crisis and the negative impact on international fundraising efforts for the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela met the ANC Youth League and the Committee of Technikon and University Principals this week, and intends meeting other student groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the meeting with technikon and university principals, the university leaders expressed concern that foreign donors -- put off by the conflict on campuses -- were starting to withdraw their funds. They expect further conflict later this year and have requested R400-million from the government to tide them over and stall possible strife over financial exclusions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In turn, Mandela has requested a co-operative stance from the institutional managements in allowing police onto campuses to quell conflict.<BR>Traditionally universities have closely guarded their autonomy by trying to keep police off their campuses unless their presence is requested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela has also asked the ANC Youth League to come out against the trashing of campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the heat is on to find lasting ways of addressing ongoing problems in the tertiary sector. After weeks of consultation, criticism and outright rejection in some quarters, the National Commission on Higher Education shuffled back to the drawing board this week to rework its document before handing the final draft to Minister of Education Sibusiso Bengu at the end of July. For the commission, it's a case of God is in the principles and the devil's in the detail, as one Chinese philosopher put it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission has been plagued from the outset by the contradictory imperatives of coming up with new policy as quickly as possible on the one hand, and making sure everyone -- particularly those at the centre of the crisis -- are happy with the results on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this second goal, the commission has failed. While most groups appear to endorse the commission's fundamental principle of &quot;co-operative governance&quot; for the higher education sector, student organisations and other groups -- including the college sector and a significant group of black intellectuals speaking for many historically black universities -- are unhappy with many of the proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Student organisations, particularly the South African Students' Congress, accuse the commission of paying lip service to the notion of consultation. They also reject the idea of a governing higher education council staffed by experts and believe the commission failed to come up with solutions to redress the imbalances in the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week they passed a &quot;motion of no confidence in the commission&quot; and called on all stakeholders to reject it as a &quot;dismal failure&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However they have mistakenly looked to the commission to come up with miraculous solutions and reflect all their concerns. They have misunderstood the commission's primary role in coming up with a discussion document compiled by experts rather than a report reflecting stakeholder concerns, says executive director Teboho Moja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the end of the day the report is our report and not an aggregation of what everyone has said. We come together to consult once we have something to consult over,&quot; said Moja. Intense government-led consultation is expected to take place in the next few months leading up to the drafting of a White Paper at the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Major concerns have been expressed over the governance system proposed by the commission, particularly the Higher Education Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is agreement on the need for a co-ordinated governing body separate from the Education Department: however whether it should be made up of stakeholders (including student and staff bodies) or experts and how much power it should have is being hotly contested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of redress is also the subject of heated debate. The commission punted the notion of &quot;earmarked&quot; funding, so that institutions be rewarded with funding for producing the necessary graduates for the country's human resource development. However the historically black universities and student groups believe this does not go far enough in restoring the current imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the commission is adamant that redress money cannot be taken from existing budgets if the sector is to expand and fulfil students' demands for greater access to higher education, there is now an acknowledgement among commissioners that some kind of redress fund -- or overt way of levelling the playing fields -- will have to be worked into new policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another hotly contested issue is that of divisions between institutions.  Increasingly, technikons and universities are taking on each other's functions but some in the sector believe the boundaries should be put back in place. The commission favours flexibility in this instance, allowing institutions to define their own role, but many of the technikons, historically black universities and technical colleges favour keeping the functions distinct. The technical colleges fear losing their identity by falling under the umbrella of higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has yet to formulate its policy position and will do so after a workshop next month. Blade Nzimande, head of the parliamentary portfolio committee on education, said the commission was faced with the dilemma of coming up with long-term solutions as a matter of urgency. Piecemeal changes would only bring short-term rewards, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The report was neither an exclusively expert report nor one that simply reflected the views of the stakeholders,&quot; said Nzimande, adding that it was not inconceivable that a Green Paper could differ significantly from the commission's report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzimande said students were at the cutting edge of educational transformation and their concerns must be looked at.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's budget vote in Parliament last week could have been the cue for a tongue-lashing from ANC MPs. Instead, they kept quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC members say the restraint was deliberate. &quot;We don't want Buthelezi leaving the Cabinet,&quot; explained a senior ANC MP.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet such an explanation raises more questions than answers. Firstly, should parliamentary scrutiny of government departments be sacrificed for the sake of better relations between political parties?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And secondly, why are the ANC and Inkatha warming to each other on the eve of the KwaZulu-Natal municipal elections?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everybody in Parliament has noticed the thawing of relations between the two parties: the way the ANC MPs have been clapping appreciatively after Buthelezi's speeches and laughing at his little jokes, and the way Buthelezi himself has been smiling in public. ANC MPs deny they have received &quot;be nice to Buthelezi&quot; instructions from top leadership, but they admit grudgingly attitudes have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One reason suggested for this warming is that the peace process is taking off in KwaZulu-Natal and this new-found sense of brotherhood is trickling through to Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But no one will comment publicly on the nature of the new IFP-ANC relationship, not even MPs from other parties. Neither can anybody explain why the two parties, after being at each other's throats for such a long time, are suddenly seeing eye to eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, speculation abounds. According to one theory coming from the ANC, the impending National Party withdrawal from cabinet has left Buthelezi a much happier man, because he feels he is now on an equal footing with Mandela in Cabinet, and does not have to share the limelight with FW de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But sources in the NP say that the ANC is warming to the IFP because it is scared of an opposition alliance which could combine the NP resources with the IFP black vote. The fear of a powerful opposition, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal and the Western Cape, has driven them into amiability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP members are sceptical about the ANC's &quot;niceness&quot;. &quot;It's just a ploy, a pre-election strategy and they are probably going to hit us hard just before the elections,&quot; commented one IFP MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's failure to meet its commitment to international mediation on the Constitution still rankles IFP members. Yet the party political debates in Parliament have, for the time being, lost their edge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Durban - Nobody remembers exactly when Wembezi took the first step down the road to ruin, but today endless rows of gutted houses are witness to the decline of this township in KwaZulu-Natal's Midlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Separate taxi ranks for political opponents in nearby Estcourt are a bitter remnant of the days when Wembezi's war threatened to engulf the city centre. The nicknames of sub-sections, like &quot;Ulundi&quot; and &quot;Shell House&quot;, testify to the continued polarisation of the township's landscape. An effective curfew operates after dark, residents being terrified of getting caught in the crossfire of the men with guns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wembezi is a microcosm of the ever-shifting patchwork of African National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party &quot;no-go&quot; areas which make up much of KwaZulu-Natal -- and which pose a major threat to the province's hopes of holding free and fair local government elections on June 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Human Rights Committee (HRC) lists 52 areas where one of the parties is unable to move and campaign freely. HRC Durban researcher Makhubetsi Sekhunyane says the list does not cover all such areas in the province, which remains &quot;essentially one big no-go area&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Wembezi, one of the province's most insatiable war-zones, three of the township's six sections are no-go areas -- C section (IFP), &quot;5-room Depot&quot; (ANC) and &quot;Longhomes&quot; (ANC). The other three -- Mahashini, Nkwezela and VQ section -- are fiercely contested terrain, claimed by both parties as strongholds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two party leaders in Wembezi, ANC chair &quot;Teaspoon&quot; Mhkize and the IFP deputy mayor in Escort, &quot;Spitfire&quot; Dlamini, say they welcome the recent peace efforts announced by their provincial leaders, but warn it will take more than high-level agreements to end the bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeting briefly this week at the local police station, the two school principals shook hands, laughed together like old friends and exchanged invitations to put up election posters in their respective strongholds. &quot;We can talk about any problem we have and find a solution together, we have no quarrel between us,&quot; said Mkhize and Dlamini in near unison. &quot;The problem is there are some people who don't want peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mkhize and Dlamini have made at least five peace bids over the past three years; all have failed to end the nightly staccato of gunfire which the HRC says has claimed at least 137 lives since 1992, and which keeps the township shrouded in fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Obrie Nzimande of the Public Order Policing Unit joined the two men in a renewed peace effort when he arrived at the station in March. &quot;Since then there have been nights when not a single shot has been fired,&quot; he boasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the confidence Nzimande appears to have won from both sides marks a significant departure from earlier claims of police complicity in the conflict, the death of at least 25 people in the township since March -- including five already this month -- along with a host of attempted murders indicate peace is still little more than a dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Dlamini and Mkhize both blamed &quot;intruders&quot; for fanning the violence, they were talking about different people. Mkhize pointed to the intervention of IFP provincial MP David Ntombela and IFP Senator Phillip Powell whose visits to the area, he said, &quot;are always followed by violence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing &quot;internal IFP problems&quot; as a reason for the ANC's recent growth in the township, Mhkize said: &quot;The IFP accuses its own people of being ANC, and then they get attacked and come to join the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC election candidate Petros Mtshali agreed. An IFP leader in the township until last December, Mtshali said he came under attack after the IFP accused his daughter of dating an amaqabane (comrade).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I didn't know who this person was, but at one meeting a youth pulled a gun and said he was going to shoot me. After that, my cousin was killed and a gunshot came through my front door and a group of youths came to my house looking for the ANC. Then I joined the ANC,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP's Dlamini -- a relative of Mtshali -- claimed a liaison between Mtshali's daughter and an ANC activist had led to the mother, and later Mthsali himself, being converted to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Dlamini admitted &quot;there have been some cases&quot; of IFP supporters being labelled ANC, he argued that the same was true of his opponents: &quot;The real problem in Wembezi is the people who are profiting from the violence -- the criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dlamini blamed the constant turf battles on youths who deserted their IFP-supporting parents in Nkwezela and other sections, and fled to the ANC's Depot-section stronghold: &quot;From there they have been terrorising people in other sections. When the victims flee their houses, these criminals take them over; they take the furniture, the stereos, everything, to make some money because they have no parents and no jobs. What is needed here are jobs, so nobody would be around to cause trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC also cites socio-economic factors as contributing to the violence. Deeply rutted dirt roads, sparse phone and electric lines, and a wrecked school and community centre are evidence of the township's dire under-development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC supporter Phikeleli Zuma -- a refugee from Nkwezela -- blamed the housing shortage and urban influx from outlying rural areas for stalling peace in the area. &quot;We can both sign a piece of paper with some agreements.  But after the agreement, I will want to go back to my house. When somebody else is living in my house, I will have to fight to get it back. Then what happens to the peace?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The David and Goliath battle between Deputy Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism Bantu Holomisa and the African National Congress has thrown tensions within the party into sharp relief and highlighted apparent confusion over its approach to dealing with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stand-off between Holomisa and the ANC over its bid to discipline him for remarks he made while testifying before the commission now threatens to be eclipsed by a broader political row sparked by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's assertion that ANC members should consult party leaders before making their submissions before the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a swift and vehement reaction, commission chair Archbishop Desmond Tutu gave notice he would be seeking clarity from the ANC on a position which could discourage members from coming forward, saying: &quot;We find it impossible to believe that a political party would seek to muzzle its rank-and- file members by vetting their statements before they approach the commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday, Holomisa formally objected to being disciplined for saying Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau, when prime minister of Transkei, took a R50 000 cut of a ER2-million bribe allegedly paid by hotel magnate Sol Kerzner to sew up gambling rights in the bantustan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC disciplinary committee chair, Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal, informed Holomisa of his rights by fax on Wednesday, but did not specify a hearing date or the charges, Holomisa told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I will refuse to appear before any disciplinary hearing,&quot; he said. He did not intend to undermine the hearing, but objected to it. &quot;I don't see how they can say I was acting outside my rights. The ANC has no policy barring members from going to the truth commission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was &quot;no rule&quot; saying ANC members should first have their statements before the commission vetted by the leadership and there had been no discussion of this in the ANC's national executive committee, he said. If such a rule existed it should have been communicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have discussed the ANC leadership making a presentation on behalf of the organisation, but as a strategic input. I went before the commission, which is constituted by an act of Parliament, as a former head of government and a concerned citizen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue has divided ANC members: the party's Women's League, led by Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, rallied behind him this week, saying: &quot;We suspect that Holomisa is guilty of telling too much truth.&quot; By contrast, the ANC Youth League, which backed Mbeki for the position of ANC deputy president in 1994, said it had &quot;full confidence&quot; in the disciplinary committee and would not comment until it had tabled its recommendations before the NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thabo Masebe, youth league secretary for information and publicity, said he did not believe the suggestion that members first clear truth commission submissions with party leadership would lead to information being suppressed.  &quot;It is more a question of the party being informed if submissions were to have implications for other party members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While he did not believe the row between Holomisa and the ANC would divide the organisation, &quot;if it is handled very badly it will have the potential of causing problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holomisa, a maverick whose outspokenness has proved a source of irritation to the ANC hierarchy on several occasions in the past, commands wide support among rank and file members. Elections for the ANC's national executive committee in 1994 saw him come in with the most votes, with Madikizela-Mandela fifth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was rebuked by Mandela last year after criticising the way the ANC handled its sacking of Madikizela-Mandela as arts and culture deputy minister and suggesting a campaign was underway within the organisation to &quot;vilify and isolate&quot; certain members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was in trouble again later for accusing an elitist ANC clique of trying to sideline members seen as &quot;populist&quot;, and subsequently apologised.  The spectacle of the ANC seeking to discipline one of its deputy ministers and Holomisa's defiant stance has obliterated the thrust of what he told the commission -- a detailed account of the National Party government's attempts, both covert and overt, to destabilise the Transkei after Holomisa came to power in a 1987 coup which toppled President George Matanzima and ousted Sigcau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My statements at the truth commission were not intended to call for the commission to investigate Sigcau or for her to be fired from government. I was overviewing the circumstances of Transkei's destabilisation by South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sigcau has never denied receiving the money. She was cleared of corruption in 1988 by the Alexander Commission, which could make no adverse finding against her on available evidence and did not recommend any further investigation, while noting the source of the money was illicit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the battle has thrown into sharp relief tensions between Holomisa and Sigcau, who spent years operating as a politician within the bantustan under the corrupt regime of the Matanzimas, yet was appointed to Cabinet in 1994 by President Mandela. Holomisa, who during his rule provided the ANC space to operate in his territory and suffered several Pretoria-driven coup attempts and budget squeezes for his pains, was given a relatively junior position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC now has to contend with public perceptions of its action, coming in the wake of Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma being judged by the party to have emerged &quot;without a blemish&quot; from the Sarafina II debacle. Rank and file members, thrown into confusion by lack of clarity on whether they should first clear submissions to the truth commission with party leaders, are also asking why Holomisa should be disciplined &quot;for telling the truth&quot; when the public protector had found that Zuma misled Parliament over the Aids play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sigcau refused to deny or confirm that she -- reportedly along with Sports Minister Steve Tshwete -- laid the complaint against Holomisa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holomisa said it appeared the decision to discipline him had been taken by ANC officials. &quot;One would have expected a matter of national importance like this would at least have been discussed by the NEC or the national working committee,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had asked ANC secretary general, Cyril Ramaphosa, to refer the matter to the NEC &quot;because of its sensitivity&quot; but had received no response.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi is determined to bury the culture in which government gave the police carte blanche to waste taxpayers' money fighting their &quot;knee jerk denials&quot; of human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with the Mail &amp; Guardian, Secretary for Safety and Security Azhar Cachalia spelled out how Mufamadi, he and National Police Commissioner George Fivaz were trying to inject an accountable, human rights culture into the police. &quot;I want to send a clear message that we are pushing for a clean break from the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of the police pumping hundreds of thousands of rands into &quot;knee jerk denials&quot; in cases lodged against them, under the new era the department will investigate cases, settle if the police are liable, and take appropriate action against the police responsible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cachalia also announced that Mufamadi had decided to withdraw an appeal being fought by the police in his name against a R180 000 damages award to former MK soldier Japie Maphalala who was tortured and imprisoned unlawfully in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the move to have a more thorough investigation into the merits of fighting cases, it would take a lot of time and effort to &quot;turn the ship around&quot;. He said there were dubious cases, such as Maphalala, which started under the old regime before he and Fivaz were appointed, and which were being fought in Mufamadi's name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case, a prime example of wasteful and unaccountable litigation, had been brought to his attention when the Mail &amp; Guardian contacted Mufamadi for comment. He said it had been difficult to find out who in the department had authorised lawyers acting in the department's name to appeal the damages award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cachalia said the written argument from lawyers acting in Mufamadi's name was morally and legally indefensible. The lawyers argued that as a soldier, Japie Maphalala should have been trained for such abuses. &quot;It is shocking that the minister should be associated with such argument. This is certainly not the view of the minister. From now on it must be clear that government is accountable for its actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only would the minister withdraw the appeal, but he would also contact Maphalala's lawyers to ask them to bring criminal charges against his torturers. &quot;Under the old era the police would not have thought it strange to defend this kind of case to the bitter end and then settle 15 minutes before a hearing after running up huge legal costs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cachalia said what was even more offensive about the way the old system ran was the &quot;absolute abdication of responsibility by the state attorney&quot;. He said part of the problem was that the state attorney's office was understaffed and underskilled. &quot;There is no tradition of doing anything other than hold counsel's bag.&quot; He said he was also troubled by the choice of counsel recruited to fight these cases, where in many instances the legal bills outstripped the damages claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the reformed system, the department would obviously have a say in what kinds of argument were put forward. &quot;The department and officials must be responsible for investigating the merits of these cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are initiating a process of legal reform which will change the relationship between the department and state attorneys. The department will now have a direct say in what criteria state attorneys use to brief counsel and what arguments they use.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cachalia stressed it was impossible to monitor all cases being fought by the police. But he said rules were being laid down so important cases of principle were brought to the attention of a senior official in Mufamadi's department. Fivaz was setting up an information system which would give department officials access to key information on what was happening in the police department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cachalia said it was not really a question of old guard officials undermining the ministry, but more that they and state attorneys were used to acting in an environment in which the minister abdicated responsibility.  &quot;That is how you get this kind of case (Maphalala).&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi is battling to control old guard civil servants who are wasting hundreds of thousands of rands of taxpayers' money by fighting cases on behalf of the police which appear to be against the public interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In several instances the cases, fought in Mufamadi's name, are against ANC victims of police abuse in the early 1990s, putting the minister in the embarrassing position of fighting his old comrades. Instead of reaching an out-of-court settlement, the state has on several occasions fought these cases at great expense all the way to the appellate division in Bloemfontein.  Two attorneys specialising in human rights cases told the Mail &amp; Guardian Mufamadi had at times personally intervened but then appeared unable to bring the bureaucrats in the state attorney's office to heel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Government officials are fighting to avoid settling these cases with the same vigour they used to keep people in detention in the old days,&quot; one said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil servants' and state attorneys' zeal appears to have enriched a select group of advocates who have specialised in acting for security force personnel. They include Barry Roux, &quot;Cor&quot; Grobelaar, and &quot;Flip&quot; Hattingh.  Roux, whose curriculum vitae includes representing the police during the Goldstone commission, has fought many of the claims for damages against the police. Hattingh has earned more than R2-million defending Vlakplaas commander Colonel Eugene de Kock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the apartheid era, a batch of advocates earned huge fees fighting for the state in political cases. A hint of the gravy train emerged during the Harms Commission of Inquiry into the Civil Cooperation Bureau, when two advocates were reprimanded by the Pretoria Bar Council for charging excessive fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week the M&amp;G reported Mufamadi was fighting a R180 000 damages award against a former MK soldier, Japie Maphalala, who was locked up unlawfully for 144 days in 1992. Judge John Coetzee awarded the damages in the Rand Supreme Court in February 1995 after cataloguing the torture inflicted upon Maphalala. Coetzee hit out at former Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel for abusing the &quot;emergency&quot; legislation of the apartheid state.  He said Maphalala had been electrocuted on his penis and ear, had his testicles squeezed, and had been shown a room full of bodies from the Boipatong massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Coeztee denied lawyers acting on Mufamadi's behalf leave to appeal the damages award -- which was a record sum -- the lawyers went on to appeal directly to Bloemfontein and succeeded in getting leave to appeal.  Mufamadi has since withdrawn the appeal (see story alongside).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senior officials in Mufamadi's department only learned of the case when the M&amp;G approached them for comment. They were struck by the absurdity that their legal team, headed by Bruce Burman, SC, was arguing for a R60 000 reduction which was likely to be less than their bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another case, lawyers acting in Mufamadi's name fought damages claims from four ANC members who were tortured by police trying to get confessions out of them in 1993. The men were arrested by the police and locked up in Sebokeng. During a criminal trial which saw one of them convicted of murder, there was a &quot;trial within a trial&quot; to discover whether the police had tortured a confession out of the accused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Roos found the evidence of assaults had been so overwhelming that the prosecution did not argue that the confessions could be admitted. In fact, the prosecution had expressed shock at the damning evidence heard against the police. Lawyers acting for the ANC men sued for damages in 1993 and have pleaded with Mufamadi's office to settle the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By March of this year, Mufamadi's office had still not settled despite assuring the lawyers in a letter that &quot;taxpayers' money is not wasted in unnecessary litigation where the facts and evidence clearly show liability on the part of the state&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not only Mufamadi's department which has puzzled and infuriated legal commentators with its approach to litigation in the new era.  Last month, the Home Affairs Department opted for the apparently untenable position of defending in the<BR>Constitutional Court a lynchpin of apartheid censorship legislation, the 1974 Publications Act. &quot;It is astonishing that the government is defending apartheid legislation and not the Constitution,&quot; said one advocate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few weeks later in the same court, the commissioner for inland revenue, represented by three advocates, conceded he had unlawfully raided Glynn Rudolph's office on the eve of the April 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite fighting Rudolph all the way to the appellate division, the commissioner capitulated in written argument days before the Constitutional Court heard the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It conceded Rudolph had been in the right all along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rudolph's lawyer, Gilbert Marcus, SC, said this was an unfortunate case of where unnecessary litigation could have been stopped in its tracks in April 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Durban- The trial of former defence minister Magnus Malan took a dramatic turn this week when Inkatha Freedom Party deputy secretary general Melchizedec &quot;MZ&quot; Khumalo suddenly turned on his political master.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Testifying in his own defence in the Durban Supreme Court murder trial he faces together with Malan and 15 others, a surprisingly relaxed Khumalo implicated the man he has served with infinite loyalty for more than 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving credence to State Security Council documents presented to court earlier by the prosecution, Khumalo said the documents made it &quot;obvious&quot; that IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and former KwaZulu Police (KZP) deputy commissioner Brigadier Sipho Mathe were aware of South African Defence Force (SADF) involvement in the 1986 paramilitary training of 200 IFP supporters in the Caprivi Strip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Testifying that he had recruited the 200 on Mathe's request, in the belief that a private security company -- Swart Security Services -- would train them for incorporation into the KZP, Khumalo said: &quot;The documents indicate that (the SADF involvement) was not something (Buthelezi and Mathe) wished should be known, because I was not personally even told of this ...  What becomes clear to me is that their withholding the fact that the military was involved indicated that they did not give me the whole true version of what was really happening here,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo said he realised &quot;by the end of 1987&quot; that the SADF was involved in the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo's testimony marks a dramatic departure from his erstwhile loyal protection of Buthelezi. When the Mail &amp; Guardian exposed the Inkathagate scandal in 1991, Khumalo -- then Buthelezi's personal assistant -- took the blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last December, sources close to Khumalo's family told the M&amp;G that his relationship with the IFP leader spanned 20 years, beginning when Khumalo worked as a propaganda officer for Eschel Roodie's notorious Department of Information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time of the 1987 KwaMakhutha massacre, Khumalo disappeared from the political scene after Inkathagate, later re-emerging in connection with subsequent party paramilitary projects. Believed to have fallen out with the IFP after the intervention of the party's white militarists, including senator Phillip Powell, Khumalo later reappeared in 1994 when he was elected to his current leadership post.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denying any knowledge of the massacre of 13 friends and relatives of United Democratic Front activist Victor Ntuli, Khumalo told the court he had received many reports on violence between supporters of the UDF and IFP at the time, but he did not remember reading about the massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo testified that his involvement with the trainees on their return from the Caprivi had been plagued by problems as most had not been incorporated into the KZP. He said he discussed the problems with Buthelezi and Mathe, and Buthelezi eventually suggested he should meet with Malan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo said he had raised problems during an August 1988 meeting with Malan in parliament, during which Malan &quot;said to me that I must remain with this project and report to him any problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo testified that he had met state witness JP Opperman &quot;about five times&quot; at the Durban Malibu hotel and the Ulundi Holiday Inn, but denied having been present during &quot;mock attacks&quot; which the state alleged were conducted prior to the KwaMakhutha massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo said Opperman had issued him with two bullet-proof vests, one for himself and one for Buthelezi: &quot;He said he wanted to test the groin part of the vest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo said he took Opperman to a donga five kilometres outside Ulundi where shots were fired at the vest. He could not confirm whether state witness Andre Cloete had been present, but denied that anyone else was present. Opperman and Cloete earlier testified that Khumalo had been present when they took 10 offensive unit members through &quot;dry runs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo is the seventh accused to the testify since the seven defence teams opened their case this week. Earlier, six Caprivi trained accused denied knowledge of the massacre or any conspiracy to kill members of the ANC,UDF and related organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six said they believed they had been trained as members of the KZP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khumalo's cross-examination is expected to continue Friday, after which the 10 former security officials will begin their defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan's attorney, Sam Maritz, SC, confirmed that Malan would take the stand in his own defence. He said he intended calling former SADF chief Tienie Groenewald -- against who charges were dismissed -- to testify, along with &quot;military experts&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Leaders of the G7 leading industrial countries will use their summit in France on June 27 to launch the &quot;Lyons terms&quot;, a debt initiative that could reduce the debt of the world's poorest countries by up to 90% by the year 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a confidential paper presented to the executive board of the World Bank this week, president James Wolfensohn will promise the bank's unconditional support for its share of the debt plan, which will cost at least $5,6-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank cautions, however, that if export growth in the recipient countries fails to meet expectations, the cost could rise rapidly to $7,7-billion or more, with the larger part of the burden falling on the bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jacques Chirac, who will host the G7 meeting, has made clear he wants Lyons to become a landmark in the history of international finance, symbolised by efforts made by industrial countries to resolve the problems of their poorer<BR>counterparts. Several former French colonies, such as Cote d'Ivoire, would stand to benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lyons terms would offer a significant advance on the Trinidad and Naples terms, which only covered 67% of debt and never addressed the far more substantial problem of funds owed to the multi- lateral organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the World Bank under Wolfensohn has thrown itself wholeheartedly behind the plan, it has partly been hampered by the IMF. The IMF has insisted the initiative be directly linked to the refinancing of its own fund to help poor countries -- the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. This would require a gold sale by the IMF to fund its contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the revised World Bank plan (dated June 4) the commitment by the bank, through a special trust fund, &quot;to reduce the present value of a country's debt would be unconditional&quot;. The bank plans to make allocations &quot;of available net income or surplus&quot; to such a trust fund and believes the IMF should do likewise, rather than waiting for gold sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The revised plan also proposes to cut the waiting time for countries qualifying for multilateral debt relief. Instead of waiting up to six years, poor countries -- such as Uganda, Bolivia and Niger -- - could see benefits after three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of 41 highly indebted countries examined by the World Bank, some 19 are classified as &quot;possibly stressed or unsustainable&quot; and therefore considered eligible for the 90% debt reductions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Amid all the fanfare surrounding the restructuring of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, two important issues -- equity and liquidity -- have still to be addressed. Do the adjustments deal adequately with access to the market by disadvantaged communities, and has the liquidity problem really been tackled?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JSE executive president Roy Andersen responds: &quot;We undertook the restructuring with two perspectives in mind. First, to ensure we are relevant in the new South Africa, and second, to interest and secure the foreign investor.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commentators have for years argued that the exchange was merely a paper-chasing-paper exercise, without playing the role of an enabling environment where entrepreneurs could form companies in order to raise capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen feels the restructuring should transform this perception. In the first instance, he explains, the JSE education programme is going a long way towards providing access and incentives to new investors from disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 1 000 students have graduated from the JSE night school and two educational officers visit factories, trade unions, and chambers of commerce. It has also launched investment competitions in the radio and print media, and flighted audio-visual material on the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In this way we are demystifying the entire concept. Furthermore, the new black-controlled listed companies on the exchange have brought 20 000 new investors to the market. We have lowered the entrance requirements for venture capital to R500 000 to make the market more accessible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen also argues that the new listing category for development capital has been added to satisfy the requirements of the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and companies listing must be involved in social service ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interestingly, capital requirements for the Development Capital Market double the requirements for the Venture Capital Markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All information concerning new investment by black investors is purely anecdotal, but black investment through pension funds is enormous,&quot; concedes Andersen. &quot;Two out of the 47 brokers' firms are black controlled. We also introduced an affirmative action policy three years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Dr Patrick Bond, senior economist at the National institute for Economic policy (NIEP), argues that &quot;the JSE is still an overpriced casino, sucking in ordinary citizens' insurance premiums and pension contributions via a small number of enormous, unaccountable institutions. The old argument ... that such funds should rather be used for development, not driving share prices ever higher ... still applies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen, however, is indifferent to this kind of critique. He points out that the JSE has made great strides -- an investigatory team is in London assessing international practices such as tax incentives for investors so more progress can be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is the systemic and structural changes that are more interesting.  Apart from the move to automation with the Johannesburg Equities Trading (JET) system, the exchange has introduced dual capacity trading and new listing requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen is clear about the impact on investors. The listing requirements allow for more disclosure. Second, brokers separate their own funds from client funds, providing the client with more protection from insolvency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, the fact that limited liability companies, and non-stockbrokers, can own part of a full member, allows banks to become members and provides more accessibility as more outlets to buy stock become available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the system may be costly in the immediate term, Andersen is categorical that in the medium term it will make the entire process cheaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fair enough, but have these reforms addressed the major issues, for example, the results of the World Competitiveness Report showing South Africa ranking lowest in the world in terms of insider trading?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen claims the JSE has raised its concerns with Parliament. He sits on an Advisory Committee on Company Law that is addressing the issue through a special committee on insider trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Committee chairman Mervyn King of Frame textiles says the committee &quot;is positive that the government is aware of the problem&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the government adopted the RDP as its policy frame of reference and seems to register a lot more than simply awareness, argues Bond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RDP clearly states in the section on reform of the financial sector that: &quot;The apartheid system severely distorted the South African financial system. A handful of large financial institutions, all linked closely to the dominant conglomerate, centralise most of the country's financial assets, but prove unable to serve most of the black community, especially women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although King would not comment on the committee process, he did state that he believed insider trading was &quot;not worse because of concentration&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What then would ensure that the market becomes liquid? For Andersen the solution is clear. &quot;Government has halved the transaction tax, but investors still think twice before turning over; the other half must go. Secondly, exchange controls must be lifted, we must be able to trade freely offshore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bond responds: &quot;Andersen brags that last year more than half of JSE trading was sourced overseas. But beginning in February, within just 10 days a huge amount of hot money that had entered South Africa in 1995 fled, leaving the country 25% poorer in US dollar terms and contributing enormously to financial instability and economic uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When this happened in Mexico, even the International Monetary Fund agreed that capital controls on incoming hot money should have been applied.  South Africa's big financial institutions obviously want to attract more hot money, arrange asset swops to take as much of their own asset base out as they can, and force government to fully liberalise exchange controls. But with the volatility now apparent in financial markets, this could very likely result in a Mexico-style meltdown.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worst-case scenario for the JSE, according to Andersen, is if the 51% of foreign investors in the JSE all withdraw; the best case is a liquid market with the JSE becoming the regional market for Southern Africa, a process that is already under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The approach we have taken will be an effective way of facilitating privatisation and a vehicle for creating a middle class in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bond concludes: &quot;The kind of reforms the NIEP advocates are increased share transaction taxes and capital gains taxes, as well as tighter controls on international financial capital flight. These are also reforms promised in the RDP. It is a reflection of the financiers' back-room political power that the RDP implementation is taking so long.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - United States exploration giant Enron is in danger of losing its exclusive rights to develop Mozambique's Pande gas fields as it has only two weeks to come up with a major client for the gas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior South African government official said this week it was very unlikely Enron would sign up with the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) by the end of June when its &quot;exclusive agreement&quot; expired.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IDC, touted as Enron's only hope, is investigating building a R2,5-billion steel plant at Phalaborwa in the Northern Province, but the project is only at pre-feasibility stage. &quot;Enron have been chasing after lots of possible clients but they have come up with very little,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Mozambique's government was likely to put the job of tapping the gas up for tender shortly after its deal with Enron ran out. A successful exploitation of the gas would provide a crucial shot in the arm for Mozambique's war-ravaged economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, Enron said it was close to signing an agreement with the IDC. The government source said the IDC project would probably use the gas in at least five years -- but the gas would be tapped by whichever company won the tender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither Enron nor Mozambican Energy Minister John Kachimila could be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's trade and Industry department is understood to be keen for Sasol to bag the gas, and then market it in South Africa. However, Sasol and Enron fell out over the development of the fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Financial Mail reported this week that Enron, which was brought into the project by Sasol, went behind Sasol's back to secure exclusive rights to the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sasol managing director Pieter Cox said recently Sasol was still interested in the fields.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - At the time of going to press, Engen, which has recently had its profits savaged by hefty restructuring costs, had not yet announced details of the deal which is believed to involve a foreign oil player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Tuesday it suspended its share price ahead of the announcement.  Market speculation pegged Elf and Mobil as its most likely suitors. Sasol, which has been eyeing a tie-up with Engen, was eliminated from the list as no cautionary announcement was slapped on its shares.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whichever company it is, a much stronger Engen will probably thwart plans for a national oil company. Senior officials in the trade and industry and finance departments are keen to set up such a company, which has become known as Sanoco, to counter the influence of the international oil majors in the South African fuel retail market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the heart of the proposed oil giant lies a merger between Sasol and Engen. It recently appeared that Total SA was also part of the equation. Both Engen, South Africa's only listed fuel retailer, and Sasol are understood to be wary of Sanoco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, a merger between Sasol and Engen appears out of the question. Sasol loses out badly as a marriage with Engen would have given it a stake in the lucrative retail market from which it is barred in terms of an agreement with the crude oil companies that buy Sasol's subsidised synthetic fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commentators say that assuming Sanoco plans stay afloat without a Sasol and Engen merger, the backing of either the United States's Mobil or France's Elf should enable Engen to resist pressure from government to become part of Sanoco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior official in a South African fuel company, who was betting on Mobil, said: &quot;Sanoco is dead if Engen teams up with Mobil. With American money behind it, it will be easier to resist efforts to get it into Sanoco.  No foreign player like Mobil or Elf would want to get into something like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say that apart from helping Engen dodge Sanoco, an international tie-up would also arm it to bag a large slice of the retail market when it is eventually deregulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanoco's backers are understood to be convinced of the need for what they call a &quot;big maverick player&quot;, which could undercut the price of the other oil companies in a deregulated market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, although playing along with Sanoco would win Engen and Sasol favour with the government, they face the prospect of being part of a company designed to keep prices down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outgoing Minerals and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha never discussed Sanoco in detail, leaving the plan to be thrashed out by colleagues in the trade and industry and finance departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha's long-serving aide Roland Darroll said this week he was keen to work under Botha's African National Congress replacement, Penuell Maduna. &quot;It would be good to work under an ANC minister,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha gave one of his last public speeches before ending an extraordinary political career launched under John Vorster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the Sub-Saharan Oil and Minerals Conference in Johannesburg: &quot;I, in the meantime, have no intention of becoming a recluse. I may still be useful to drive a truck or two on certain roads which I know well ... There may still be a distance to be travelled.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - On the eve of a top-level government and private-sector roadshow targeting international investors in Cannes, all eyes are on the government's long- awaited growth plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task of selling South Africa abroad is becoming more and more a priority on everyone's agenda, says acting director general of finance, Maria Ramos. But it won't be easy: &quot;South Africa is being looked at in a more realistic light; the post-election glow has given way to hard analysis on the part of international investors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Global competition means we have to offer more than most -- even those countries with less positive fundamentals,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Providing that may prove more difficult. The original growth scenario mooted by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in February envisaged 6% growth by the year 2000 based on a 10% boost to exports and investment. But with the upswing in worldwide demand for commodities fading fast, that projection looks unsustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly our manufacturing industry is not strong enough to take up the slack. Investment goals, with the associated Keynesian kick-start, are also proving unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has been very good on intentions, setting up yet more committees and commissions and concentrating on consensus-seeking, but its record has been dire in terms of making difficult choices,&quot; says an analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time is not expected to be any different. &quot;It (the growth plan presented by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel) will be yet another whitewash, with the government telling us what they think we want to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What they haven't realised is that 6% growth is not attainable without sacrifices. As it is we're going to have a tough time getting to 3% growth for the foreseeable future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki heads the list of dignitaries attending the three day conference in Cannes; with virtually every government department represented, the pressure will be on ministers to impress the Europeans with hard proof of policy direction. Last year's conference in Switzerland resulted in positive feedback, but this year's key speakers -- Manuel, Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau and Trade Minister Alec Erwin -- can no longer rely on goodwill alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Andrew, the Democratic Party's economics representative, says attainable, short-terms goals are more important than long-term plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've been let down so many times that expectations are running very high. We need to address the problems of fiscal discipline and economic growth by setting short, medium and long-term targets. Then we can quickly ascertain if they are being met and change course accordingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With so much to do at once, the government has to prioritise and compromise. It must set the parameters and stick to them, enforcing them rigidly within all the different departments. It won't be easy; the Cabinet faces tough decisions, but we could end up sinking the whole country if we try to do everything at once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest sense of expectancy was felt in the financial markets -- the rand was firmer and bonds weakened on rumours of concrete proposals on privatisation and the lifting of exchange controls. The concomitant cost of disappointment will be high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any fudge will not go down well,&quot; says Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor. &quot;It is vital that we have more than just rhetoric and grand ideals to take to France on Monday. We can't go empty-handed,&quot; says Ian Robinson, executive director of the Building Industries Federation of South Africa, and one of the participants.<BR>-0</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Pele is a lousy tipster -- his prediction for big success before the start of USA 94 was ill-starred Colombia -- so the Croatians can start worrying now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In England for the start of Euro 96, the great Brazilian was asked the inevitable question, and confessed he was struggling for an answer. &quot;It's very hard to pick the eventual champions of a tournament like this, because it seems all the leading teams are very even,&quot; he said. &quot;The difference between the sides is not too big, but I did see Croatia not long ago and I like the way they play. They have some good players, they play very nice football. If there is going to be a surprise winner I would go for them.  Portugal, too, have impressed me.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this sounds vaguely insulting to the established powers of Europe, it is not meant to be. &quot;The best teams in the world are over here,&quot; Pele admitted. &quot;If you took Europe out of the World Cup, it would be quite a different tournament. Normally, you look to England, Germany and Holland to be strong, and I don't think it will be any different this time. England have got to have a chance as they are the hosts, and this is definitely the time for them to wake up and come good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Holland, France, even Germany play openly at the moment, but England still look to me to be playing defensively,&quot; he said. &quot;Their line-up looks defensive, anyway. Playing with one forward is not going out for a win, is it? I think Alan Shearer is a good player, but he must get lonely up there on his own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okay, teams must defend when they lose the ball, but when England have the ball they seem afraid to go forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pele has been disappointed by England in the 30 years since he was kicked out of the World Cup here in 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Everybody supported England in 1966, but in all the years afterwards we didn't see them do any good,' he said. The limited glory that was 1970 and 1990 fails to register on the Pele scale, and the Brazilian minister of sport was particularly disappointed at England's absence from America two years ago. 'I spent a lot of time trying to get the World Cup to come to the USA, and I kept telling people that England would be one of the attractions, then they didn't come,' he complained. 'I think England need to wake up and realise that the defensive way they play is a handicap.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defensive is not a word that many coaches prefer to use, but Pele is not a coach, and presumably never could be, since his preference for attacking football makes Kevin Keegan look conservative. He tends to fall out with coaches who argue in favour of safety-first tactics or over-technical approaches, and had words with Carlos Parreira, the Brazilian coach, over the way the simple purity of the traditional Brazil style was compromised in the last World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a simple purity, too, about the way Pele sees international football. 'I was totally against the way we played in America, and I told Parreira so,' he said simply. 'Parreira said &quot;Pele, we came here to win, we had to play like that.&quot; I can respect that, but I don't necessarily agree with it. If you ask the Brazilian fans, they don't like the way we play, either. But sometimes we are the best team in the competition, as we were in Spain in 1984, and we don't win, so it is difficult. But if you always play positively, you win more matches than you lose, and you give the supporters what they want.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parreira, not to mention Terry Venables, one of his most ardent admirers, would view this as over- simplistic, not to say over-romantic. The game has moved on, Venables argues, from the time when talent and sheer ability was enough to win tournaments. The England coach is fond of quoting his Brazilian counterpart's dictum that the star of the team must be the whole team, and undoubtedly draws inspiration from Parreira's successful attempt to introduce discipline and organisation into his side in the face of overwhelming public opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'I would like to see England play more for a win. But I am not a coach, except at home in my house. And in my house I think everybody should play positively and play for a win.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - By Sunday morning, the 26-strong Springbok squad will be history and the debate on selections will already be in full swing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the agreement and criticism of the squad's make- up for the one-off Test against Fiji at Loftus Versfeld on July 2 and the Sanzar series internationals against Australia and New Zealand, which follow immediately, are all part of the healthy climate of debate which is so much part of the magic of man's sporting endeavours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Andre Markgraaff and his selection panel, perhaps the greatest problem will be in creating cover in key positions without having the facility to choose two full sides. In some positions, this presents few problems, in others the headaches could reach the proportions of an unmanageable migraine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the question of Francois Pienaar's nagging shoulder injury. It is unthinkable that Markgraaff and company can leave as fine a player and as gifted a captain out if he is fit. Pienaar simply means too much to the side and to the game as a whole for this to be a consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will surely be first choice alongside Ruben Kruger at the side of the scrum, which leads to the question of covering these two. In this regard, Markgraaff has a number of options and one that readily presents itself is to name players who are versatile enough to take over this role given the fact that Kruger operates as well on the blind side as he does as an open side flank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here, the thinking could be governed by choosing the on-form Steve Atherton, playing some of the best rugby of his life at lock, and Schutte Bekker to back up Gary Teichmann at No 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Teichmann has been almost without peer in this specialist role this season, but moving him to the side of the scrum in an emergency is another option which opens up if he is selected and giving Mark Andrews -- an automatic choice in the second row -- the job he did at the back of the scrum for the Amabokoboko in the World Cup final and semi-final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adriaan Richter will doubtless come strongly into the frame. But Bekker is probably a better long-term bet than his veteran Northern Transvaal teammate and fills the gap left by the injury which has ruled Fritz van Heerden out of contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Admittedly, this is not an ideal solution, but with three Tests coming up against a trio of nations where the big hit tackle is de rigueur, it will certainly open some avenues in a worst-case injury scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If selecting the Natal pairing of Andrews and Atherton at lock -- and they are the form pair this season -- is the route the selectors follow, the back-up could well come in the form of Hannes Strydom and Johan Ackermann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strydom is a known and dependable quantity and Ackermann is a really exciting prospect for the future. The big Northern Transvaler deserves to get the nod ahead of the arguably better line-out skills of his provincial teammate, Krynauw Otto, because of his physical presence, something that has looked to be lacking in Otto on the evidence of Super 12 performances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the thinking on prop forwards revolves around the ability to pack at either side of the scrum. Os du Randt is surely an automatic choice at loose head now he is back in full cry for Free State and exhibiting the form which makes him a standout from a position not renowned for creating players as able to dominate in open play as in the nether regions of the machine room in the set-pieces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, with Balie Swart still to make an impact after coming back from surgery, it would be risky in the extreme to pick the World Cup tight-head until he has come back sufficiently strongly at provincial level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here, Markgraaff could well go for Garry Pagel, switching the Western Province iron man from the loosehead role he currently fills for his Currie Cup side and backing this pairing up with Toks van der Linde and Marius Hurter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hooking berth presents some dilemmas too. John Allan is the form man this season and his understanding in the vital area of the throw-in with Andrews and Atherton has been peerless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ability to cover is also a strong consideration in the make-up of the backline players who will make the squad. Andre Joubert is an automatic choice, but Markgraaff will surely look to the exciting emergent talent of Dawie du Toit as back-up with James Small, who started his provincial career in the No 15 jersey as insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Small is back to the form which brought him international recognition in the first place and, with Pieter Hendriks and Justin Swart, should make up the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swart has been in superb scoring form this season and has provided many of the flashes in an otherwise dull season for the Newlands faithful, reeling from defeat to defeat with almost metronomic consistency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hennie le Roux, Japie Mulder and Dawie Snyman make up the centre trio, giving the young Northern Transvaler the break he so richly deserves alongside the World Cup pairing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Selecting Le Roux at centre and Henry Honiball as back-up to Joel Stransky at flyhalf also opens the doors for positional switches if needed.  Le Roux is equally at home in the pivot position and Honiball is no stranger to playing in the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stransky surely must keep his position despite some lacklustre form for Western Province and some wayward kicking. He has two vital things going for him ... he is the man in the saddle and has always been a big-game player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At scrumhalf, there can be no doubt that Joost van der Westhuizen is without a significant challenger. He has the ability to change the face of a match with one of those searing breaks which leaves opposition stranded in his wake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while not suggesting that playing Van der Westhuizen out of position is a viable option, it cannot be ignored that he has substituted both on the wing and at flank in Test matches. To back Van der Westhuizen up, the selectors will surely go for the known quantity and call up Transvaal's Johan Roux, a seasoned veteran in the green and gold and a fine tactical kicker on his day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the analysis though, armchair selection is a dangerous business and there will be almost as many variations on paper as there will be players in the final line-up the selectors decide on.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa takes the second of what they hope will be eight steps to paradise when they host Malawi on Saturday in the return match of a World Cup preliminary tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall victory against the Central Africans, and there are strong grounds for optimism following a 1- 0 first-leg success in Blantyre two weeks ago, would take Bafana Bafana into the mini-league second phase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A separate draw on a date to be announced will divide the 16 preliminary winners plus the four countries who received byes (Cameroon, Nigeria, Egypt, Morocco) into five groups of four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each team plays its three opponents at home and away with three points for a win and one for a draw and the group winners qualify for the 32-nation finals in France.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe are probably a million kilometres from the mind of national coach Clive Barker today as he prepares to complete a mission that began promisingly in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid all the criticism of the missed chances from Philemon Masinga and Shaun Bartlett, the media and the football public appear to have forgotten what a good result it actually was for Bafana Bafana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compare the 1-0 triumph at the Chichiri Stadium with the results of Zambia, Algeria, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mozambique, and national coach Clive Barker has every right to demand the erection of a monument in his honour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not that those misses should be brushed aside, but that they should be seen in the overall context of a match which South Africa controlled for long periods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sweeping one-touch move which led to Bartlett having his shot pushed on to the upright by Malawian goalkeeper Bothwell Kuwanda came straight from a best-selling Brazilian manual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masinga was the biggest culprit with his second-half blunder almost unbelievable as he failed to steer the ball into the net from a couple of metres with Kuwanda helpless on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker has wisely and rightly defended his forward from some sections of the media with questionable motives and the &quot;hate mail&quot; some newspapers seem far too eager to publish. Masinga happens to be the joint leading scorer in the national team with Doctor Khumalo and has the benefit of being a full- time professional operating in a top-class environment at Leeds United.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also went into the Malawi match with several large and extremely dark clouds hanging over his head, specifically the &quot;traffic affair&quot; and his future with the English Premiership club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever did happen in Braamfontein that Wednesday afternoon when the slick wheels of Bra Phil pulled up so that teammate Innocent Buthelezi could buy some burgers, is irrelevant. But the publicity and the court appearance could only have distracted &quot;Chippa&quot; from the task at hand and may well have affected his performance in front of 60 000 superbly behaved Malawians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masinga has also been hit by British regulations which stipulate that foreign footballers must play in 75% of matches each season to continue at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masinga fell well short of that target and when Leeds applied for his work permit to be renewed, the British authorities turned it down. As things stand, Masinga must seek a new club, or a new country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Letters from so-called football fans telling Masinga that he is in line for the &quot;Makalakalane&quot; treatment can only add to the torment ahead of the match at FNB Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barker now faces a difficult choice. Does he give in to public opinion (as he was forced to do with white-shoed Augustine Makalakalane) or does he give Masinga another chance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sean Dundee apart (and that is another issue for another day), South Africa is not exactly blessed with free-scoring forwards and the likely replacement for Masinga is Brendan Augustine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Austrian-based former Bush Bucks star has been capped 10 times, scored three goals and never let his country down. But is he a vastly superior player to Masinga?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finishing apart, South Africa impressed in Blantyre, restricting a home team which had boasted of winning by two goals to a single clearcut chance (a header from Albert Mpinganjira which Andre Arendse tipped over).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi were incredibly inept with little imagination in attack against quick-tackling, physically stronger South African defenders and Chancey Gondwe and Ernest Chirwali never stamped their authority in midfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But at least the pressure is off the &quot;Flames&quot; on Saturday. No one really gives them a chance while expectations are high for the holders of the African Nations' Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many respects the World Cup match will resemble a cup tie between a First Division club and an amateur side. An early goal for the favourties and they can cruise to victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the longer the match remains scoreless, the more confident the underdogs become and the more frustrated the favourites get. South Africa may be in the driving seat, but if Malawi score first they will share the steering wheel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the countries finish level on aggregate after 90 minutes, the Golden Goal will apply for the first time at senior level in Africa with the first goal scored in extra time determining the winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, if there are no goals after 30 minutes of extra time, the normal penalty shootout will apply with each team taking a mandatory five followed by sudden-death kicks if needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All this should not be necessary, though, because if football fans turn up in large numbers and support their country (which means the coach and his players), South Africa should move within six steps of the ultimate dream.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There haven't been too many column centimetres devoted to the name of Simon Malindi as the experts debate the favourites to lift the Comrades Marathon crown on Monday. It is after all the first time the 33-year-old Scaw Harriers athlete has attempted the mother of all races and it is seldom won by a novice. But while Malindi may be short on experience he is not lacking in pedigree and those with serious aspirations to victory will write him off at their peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A relative apprentice in the ranks of ultra runners, Malindi first ventured beyond the standard marathon distance after a string of disappointing results over 42.2km. His coach Francisco Andre observed that Malindi was still strong after a poor run in the Lisbon Marathon at the end of 1993 which saw him repeat his 2:19 personal best from Paris and the Hyper to Hyper Marathon in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After Lisbon Francisco told me he thought I would do better at ultra marathons. He suggested I start with the City to City because it is only 8km longer than a marathon. He changed my programme and increased my mileage. To me it was much easier and I won the race,&quot; recalls Malindi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a fine induction into life beyond the marathon which claimed the scalps of such seasoned ultra runners as Nixon Nkodima, Phineas Mokaba and Lucas Matlala. &quot;I could see he was cruising when he finished in Lisbon and I told him that on a good day he could probably run a 2:13 marathon but that still wasn't good enough to do well internationally,&quot; says Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In South Africa people respect ultra marathon runners more than anything. You just have to look at the money put into a race like Comrades compared with the Olympic marathon trials. That's the way it is in South Africa and I decided if you can't beat them, join them!&quot; he says. Malindi's next target was last year's Two Oceans Marathon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was the same story as for City to City. Francisco said it's just another 6km and altered my programme. He said, 'Don't worry, just train,' and then I went and ran a good time and won the race,&quot; says Malindi. Malindi's 3:10:53 Two Oceans victory was the fastest in five years and the sixth-fastest ever. &quot;I suppose you could say Simon found his niche. Now he's a personality in South Africa,&quot; declares Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malindi's athletic progress owes much to the astute guidance of Andre whose own path towards coaching excellence has also been remarkable.  Ironically it was a dose of old fashioned, apartheid-style racism that set him on his course. Andre was a &quot;fairly average&quot; middle distance runner in Portugal and emigrated to South Africa in 1981. As an employee at Scaw Metals he competed in the early Eighties versions of company relays which were more akin to social bonding outings -- for white executives -- - than athletics contests before the mining houses started entering their best black athletes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scaw followed suit and opened its team to everyone in 1985. &quot;There were good quality athletes in our team but then I never saw them again until the next relay the following year. In 1986 I spoke to them and asked why they didn't run more often. They said they'd love to but they had no transport and didn't know where and when to compete. I ended up taking them to road races and a couple of them turned out to be quite good,&quot; remembers Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He decided to enrol one of them at his own club, Alberton AC, and took Nelson Buthulezi round to the chairman's house. Andre was stunned by what he heard. The chairman told them he couldn't prevent black runners from joining the club but he would never allow them into the club house or invite them to prize givings even though he acknowledged they could become the best athletes at the club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andre told him to take a long run and keep going. He went back to his employers and asked them if they would set up a club, and Scaw Harriers was born. &quot;The athletes had so much faith in me after that that they started asking me for advice about their running and I couldn't answer them,&quot; says Andre. So he wrote to Bernado Manuel in Portugal whom he used to train with in Lisbon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel, an Angolan, was then understudy to the great Moniz Pereira, the Portuguese national coach who put the likes of Carlos Lopes (1984 Olympic marathon champion) and Fernando Mamede (former 10 000m world record-holder) onto the map. Manuel, who has now taken over from Pereira, started assisting Andre and recommended two books to him, one of which was Pereira's story of how he coached Lopes. &quot;One of the things I took from Pereira's book was his favourite saying which, roughly translated, says, 'A good meal is not made from rice or meat only. It is a careful blend of the right ingredients.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I looked at my situation in South Africa and I also blended various running philosophies and coaching methods to suit my own athletes just as Pereira had done for the Portuguese runners,&quot; says Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That he has been successful there can be no doubt. He took Abel Mokibe to the South African marathon title and the Barcelona Olympics and made Meshack Dandane into one of the country's top 5 000m runners before injuries took their toll. Scaw Harriers are now also the top company relay side in the world after winning last year's World Corporate Challenge in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malindi is the latest success story. &quot;I was very lucky to meet somebody like Francisco. He's a very good coach and I have complete trust in him,&quot; says Malindi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malindi's debut in Comrades has actually come a year earlier than Andre had planned. &quot;For a long time I had the goal to build Simon up for Comrades and I was really aiming for next year but that will be a down run. Simon is strong on hills and he's not getting any younger so we decided to give it a go this year. Even if he doesn't win he will gain experience for the future and I believe he has what it takes for a race like Comrades,&quot; says Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the biggest adaptations for Malindi was the type of training he had to do for Comrades. &quot;Simon likes his track work and time trials. He's always been used to a lot of quality work and for a long time he's had to concentrate on quantity and strength work in the gym,&quot; reveals Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a full time employee at Scaw who does work study analyses in the steel rolling mills he didn't have the time to do very high mileage as well as gym work. His peak training never exceeded 160km a week. Andre did condition him for the loneliness of Comrades though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I used to deliberately start his training sessions later than the rest of the group. He used to go home with them on the train to Tembisa and he didn't like it when they left and he still had to do some more track work.  Comrades is a lonely race and I wanted to build up his discipline and self reliance. He needed to be alone with his thoughts and realise why he was doing what he was doing,&quot; says Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four weeks ago Andre took Malindi to Durban for a weekend to train on the course and he finally realised what all the hard work was for. &quot;It's a very tough course but it's up to the individual how they approach the race.  You must be clever and use your head in Comrades,&quot; says Malindi, who is meticulous in his preparations and has spent hours watching videos of the race and talking to experienced Comrades runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One thing in Malindi's favour that hasn't been available to many black runners before is that he will have a full back-up team from Scaw on race day. &quot;I know the market goes with who can best sell a product but in the past there was never an attempt to give support to people like Hoseah Tjale. I believe he could have won Comrades if he was given the support people like Bruce Fordyce received,&quot; says Andre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; That's one of the reasons Fordyce could do so well. Not only was he one of the best prepared athletes physically but also logistically. We all know that without a back up team in Comrades you're on your own and it's difficult to do well. We realised this and approached Scaw and they said we could have whatever we needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andre is realistic about Malindi's chances on Monday and is not making any brash predictions. &quot;We know there's a big question mark over Simon in the Comrades because he's never raced the last 30km, but he's very confident in a nice kind of way and he's in good shape. He's also a very intelligent runner and knows exactly what he wants to do and where he must do it,&quot; Andre says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to Malindi that much is evident. &quot;I don't want to be faster than 2:48 or slower than 2:52 at halfway. The race will really begin after 60km and at that stage its all in the mind. If your mind is weak you will never make it. You must believe in yourself and never give up. I believe I can finish in the top 10 but if there is a chance for me to win I won't let it pass me by,&quot; says Malindi. And one thing Malindi certainly has in abundance is self belief.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TELEVISION: Andrew Worsdale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Film-maker Khalo Matabane was only two years old on June 16 1976. Twenty years later he has been commissioned by SABC3 to research and produce a documentary on the legacy of that day. The result is an intriguing hour-long film, &quot;Two Decades Still,&quot; that expressly looks for the story behind the three or four fallen icons the media have held up as flagbearers of an uprising which, says Matabane, contributed more than any other to the shaping of South Africa today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the course of his research, Matabane began to realise that &quot;it was not just that a generation unafraid to face the gun injected the struggle with a new freshness, it was also how the entire community was affected behind the scenes -- from those kids to their parents to the hostel-dwellers and the workers ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the documentary, writer and activist Duma Ndlovu describes how his decidedly apolitical, domestic- worker mother was transformed into an activist when she heard accounts of children being shot at. It is this communal legacy that the film-maker wants to preserve for posterity. &quot;When I saw Schindler's List I realised we can't just move on without understanding our own histories ... During my research I realised that the full hypocrisy of the new South Africa can only be understood when we see how many of these people haven't been given due homage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is, however, a legacy with its own confounding realities. During the shoot the crew was held up by armed robbers while filming in the Morris Isaacson School (where the fuse of the uprising was lit) and their equipment, tapes, cellphones, wallets and minibus were stolen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another point of interest is the film-maker's attempt to interview a leading organiser of the protests, Zweli Sizane. When the film-makers arrived to interview him they discovered the full effects of police brutality and detention. Suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, Sizane was unable to give a comprehensible interview. There can be no doubt that June 16 1976 lives on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Two Decades Still&quot; will be screened on SABC3 at 6pm on June 16</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - &quot;I have waited 20 years for this,&quot; says Peter Magubane, whose exhibition &quot;Never Never Again&quot; commemorates June 16 1976 and celebrates the re-release of his book, The Fruit of Fear, removed from the shelves three hours after its first launch in 1986. &quot;Yet at the time I would never have believed I would commemorate it in a free, democratic South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magubane is one of several artists -- some of whom could barely count to 16 at the time -- commemorating the student revolt that inexorably changed the course of South African history. &quot;Without 1976, without the courage of those schoolchildren, we wouldn't be where we are today,&quot; insists Magubane, who spent June 16 as cameraman, ambulance driver and -- after suffering a broken nose courtesy of a police baton -- casualty. &quot;They showed the adults the way.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Step inside the Morris Isaacson School in Rockville, Soweto, or the Phefeni Senior School in Orlando West, and you'll meet a type of schoolchild very different from the generation of 1976. The &quot;we will never forget&quot; crowd competes with coiffed young women whose political consciousness extends no further than a first-hand knowledge of mating manoeuvres, and with teenage boys emulating the slouch of their Hollywood heroes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mention the name of Dan Motsitsi, a student leader in 1976, and some faces light up. Others register blankness. &quot;That's the date I met my boyfriend,&quot; says a student when asked what significance June 16 holds for her. &quot;We celebrate our second anniversary this weekend.&quot; She is 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No wonder Magubane titled his exhibition Never Never Again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Not only should the events of June 16 never be repeated, but the memory must never be erased,&quot; says Kevin Brand, who, together with several other Cape Town-based artists, is participating in Faultlines, a series of projects organised by the Mayibuye Centre around the events of June 16. Situated at the Castle in Cape Town, Brand's work includes a giant mural -- three images transposed on to the outer and inner walls of the castle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the outside wall he has chosen that enduring photograph of Hector Petersen, for which photographer Sam Nzima received a R200 &quot;bonus&quot;. &quot;I have examined Nzima's contact sheet,&quot; says Brand, &quot;and it is obvious why that shot was chosen above all the others. It resembles a pietC.&quot; Brand has selected photographs with similar themes of tragedy and sacrifice for the inside walls. &quot;Petersen was the most recognised icon of 1976, yet although (the uprising) revolved around specific issues, its message and meaning are universal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the foyer of MuseumAfrica in Newtown stands a series of framed newspaper headlines, images and articles spanning the period June 16 1976 to August 1976. An integral part of Magubane's exhibition, the display serves a strangely schizoid role: as conventional truth-teller -- document of and testimony to the revolt -- and hyperreal tour of the past, assuming a greater truth than the event itself. Some might regard 1976 as a historical snuff movie, a theme-park tragedy or a curious period piece told through a racially punctuated narrative and headlines like &quot;I saw a child shot and I couldn't look&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magubane and Nzima witnessed 1976. Kendell Geers didn't. He was nine years old at the time, the progeny of a &quot;white trash&quot; right-wing working-class family in the suburb of Leondale, Germiston, a stone's throw from Katlehong and Natalspruit townships -- two of the hotspots of 1976. His enduring memory of the day is hearing his police relatives talking about their covert missions into the townships. Later, he tracked down the death register of 1976, with Petersen's name scrawled on it. As a student he reproduced the image of Petersen and titled it Blood Sport. He also produced a photograph of himself taken on his ninth birthday, at the circus, and called it June 1976.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;History takes place on a physical level,&quot; he explains. &quot;Yet it gets coded into a number and text. It becomes an object of appropriation, saying little about the truth of the event but much about our perceptions of it.&quot; Now, Geers has teamed up with mixed-media artist Willie Bester at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg, producing two June 16 installations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On a formal level our work is different, but its underlying concerns with history and images of violence are similar,&quot; explains Bester, &quot;as was our experience of 1976, although we saw it from opposite sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time Bester was a police reservist in Cape Town. A year later, he witnessed the deployment of a special task force to monitor the situation in the Cape. &quot;They were given pick-axes to deal with the childen and received permission to use live ammunition on them.&quot; He adds: &quot;I saw 18 kids lying on top of one another. I still can't come to terms with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bester's work for the show comprises a sculpture made from an old motorcycle, titled The Oxwagon. It confronts issues of insularity and identity, but mostly it is about the need for reconciliation. &quot;In order to achieve this, our history must be revealed in its entirety. We are all damaged, but with remembrance comes healing, in the same way that a lamp lights up the dark.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Magubane's exhibition is on view at MuseumAfrica until July 28; Bester and Geers's show opens at the Goodman Gallery on June 15, and Faultlines opens at the Castle on June 16</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to President Henri Konan Bedie of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), June 13, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Your Excellency,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to protest in the strongest terms the confirmation of the two-year sentences of journalists Abou Drahamane Sangar , Emmanuel Kor and Freedom Neruda of the Nouvel Horizon media group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An appeals court in Cote d'Ivoire confirmed, on Wednesday, 12 June, the two-year jail sentences imposed on the three journalists for insulting the head of state in the opposition daily newspaper, &quot;La Voie.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three &quot;La Voie&quot; journalists-director of publications Sangar , reporter Kor and deputy editor Neruda-will now appeal to the supreme court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 18 December 1995 the newspaper had published a satirical article suggesting that Your Excellency's presence brought bad luck to the Ivoirian soccer team ASEC by attending the African Champions Cup final, which ASEC lost to South Africa's Orlando Pirates. Sangar and Kor were arrested on 21 December 1995 and sentenced to two years in prison on 28 December 1995 for &quot;offenses against the head of state.&quot; &quot;La Voie&quot; was also fined three million CFA francs (US$6,000) and banned for three months. Neruda was arrested on 2 January 1996 and sentenced to two years on 11 January 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan group of journalists dedicated to the protection of its colleagues worldwide, CPJ contends that the sentences handed down against Sangar , Kor and Neruda are excessive and unjustified. Having written to Your Excellency on two previous occasions regarding this matter, we strengthen our call for the reversal of their convictions, and their immediate and unconditional release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Anti-riot police stood guard at strategic locations and patrolled Lagos streets under heavy rain Wednesday as residents ignored calls by anti-government groups to stay at home on the third anniversary of Nigeria's annulled 1993 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The security measures came in the wake of threats of demonstrations by pro-domocracy groups in the build-up to the anniversary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The detained millionaire-politician, Moshood Abiola, claimed he won the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is awaiting trial for treasonable felony after proclaiming himself president of Nigeria in June 1994. The military administration of Gen. Sani Abacha has refused to heed calls for Abiola's release and says the trial will go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pro-democracy groups warned Tuesday they would protest as hundreds of sympathizers offered the eighth day Islamic prayers for Abiola's wife, Kudirat. She was shot dead June 4 in Lagos by unidentified men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Campaign For Democracy, one of the anti-government groups, Tuesday cancelled its rallies planned for Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's acting national president, Olugbenga Awosode, told journalists that the association had decided against the national rallies because of developments in the country, especially the death of Kudirat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports from western Nigeria, Abiola's home area and the bastion of opposition to the military administration, also spoke of tight security to forestall protests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police in the area had earlier banned rallies and political meetings, warning that trouble makers would be arrested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum of some 15 intellectuals, politicians and military officers, organized by the United States embassy and the Institute for Economic Affairs, said this would help end the spate of coups in Africa and enhance democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forum discussed &quot;Civil and Military Relations in Democratic Societies: the American Experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonel Dan Henk of the United States Army, who led the discussions, said maintaining a healthy balance between liberty and security in a democracy is a &quot;complex and delicate&quot; issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Democracy is an unfinished business and efforts to maintain a balance between liberty and security will always meet new challenges,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Col. Henk, Director of African Studies at the U.S. Army War College, said Africa should borrow selectively in its efforts to find solutions to its problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He stressed the importance of training, saying the U.S military places emphasis on &quot;military subordination to civil authority&quot;, adding &quot;this is a very fundamental part of our ethics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said no single group of persons in the U.S. has power or control of the military, adding that the military cannot be &quot;used to stage a coup without shattering the constitution which the military owes allegiance to.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum - A group of Pakistani eye surgeons has been touring various parts of Sudan, operating up to 400 patients a day, free of charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pakistani Eye Hospital, as it is called by the common man in Sudan, operates patients in tents installed in any empty space, anywhere.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The head of the group, Amir Yousif told PANA that none of the operations had failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have operated thousands of patients. We have performed major and minor eye operations in Khartoum, Rufa'a, El Obied Kamlinnn, Damazin, Medani, Dongola, Merowe and Halfa...We have established six camps in one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mobile hospital, an affiliate of the &quot;Eyesight Charity Society&quot;, a Saudi-Pakistani charity organization, does not charge its patients any medication fees. &quot;In fact we pay for their medicine and eyeglasses,&quot; said Yousif.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a member of the team, Dr Khaleeg el Rahman, most of the patients suffered from cataract or glucoma, mainly due to excessive heat and dust, although the disease can also occur because of old age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Diabetes also causes cataract..Diabetes is reminiscent of sugar. You in Sudan consume huge quantities of sugar. People do not know the destructive effect of sugar on the eyes..If sugar does not harm you body, it is sure to harm the bodies of you children,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eye specialist said his organization was preparing to establish the first eye bank in Sudan. &quot;Everything is ready, he said, adding that some doctors who had been training abroad have returned and were ready to assume work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra- Ghana turned down Tuesday appeals from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to accept Zolotitsa, the Russian vessel carrying some 400 refugees from Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to the Ghana News Agency in Accra after a meeting with government officials, UNHCR representative in Ghana, Chrysantus Ache, said Ghanaian authorities stuck to their decision not to accept the ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting, which was at the instance of the UNHCR, followed concerns about the fate of the passengers who have been at sea for about two weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister of foreign affairs, Obed Asamoah, who led the government side at the talks, said that acceptance of the ship will trigger social and economic consequences that the country cannot bear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said in as much as Ghana appreciates the plight of the refugees, she would be doing more harm than good to herself, if she accepted the boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asamoah said he would not want to believe that there are Ghanaians on board, adding that some people might be claiming citizenship just to win sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ache, the authorities agreed to a request to assist aid workers, especially medical experts, to have access to the boat, which is believed to be in international waters off the Ghanaian coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his appeal, Ache reaffirmed UNHCR's preparedness to &quot;take full responsibility&quot; for the refugees if the ship was allowed to dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said there were enough resources for as many as 5,000, and appealed that the ship be allowed to dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the UNHCR headquarters in Geneva has issued another appeal to West African nations to permit the ship to dock for humanitarian purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday, navy tugboats for the second time in 48 hours, towed the ship back to sea after it apparently returned to Ghanaian waters off Takoradi harbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Togolese authorities refused to allow it to discharge its passengers last Wednesday, after they provided food and water to the fugitives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States has also appealed to West African countries to allow the ship to dock for humanitarian reasons, and promised to help cater for the refugees in collaboration with U.N. agencies and international relief organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, Ghana bowed to intense diplomatic pressure and took in about 2,000 refugees from Liberia on board an old Nigerian freighter, Bulk Challenge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - South Africa was on Wednesday reeling from the shock disclosure that crime cost the country seven billion dollars last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disclosure emerged from a a survey conducted by the Nedcor Project on Crime, Violence and Investment, funded by the national banking group, Nedcor Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey points out that the seven billion dollars spent on crime last year was equal to 5.6 percent of South Africa's Projected Gross Domestic Product for this year, and 18 percent of the government's national budget.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leader of the survey team, Prof. C. Lee of Witwatersand University, told reporters on Tuesday that steadily increasing crime and diminishing public confidence in the government's ability to combat it were leading to an unstable economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is badly hurting business, reducing confidence and diminishing local investment,&quot; he added, &quot;and we cannot afford it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey covered 300 businesses, 47 shopping centres, 59 business experts and 2,163 individuals. It took more than a year to complete at a cost of 700,000 U.S. dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eighty-two percent of the small businesses and 59 percent of the large companies admitted that crime was a deterrent to further investment in the local economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee pointed out that the annual cost of crime in South Africa was equal to 19 months of net capital inflow into South Africa following the historic 1994 general elections which ushered democratic rule in the former apartheid enclave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also exceeded the projected benefits over ten years in South Africa of the 2004 Olympic Games, should Cape Town win the rights to host the global games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ineffective crime prevention is also highlighted by the report, which says that for every 1,000 crimes committed only 77 criminals are convicted, and only eight are sentenced to more than two years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Crime is costing almost double the amount of money being spent on trying to catch criminals,&quot; Lee said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy safety and security minister, Joe Mathews, told the news briefing that the government acknowledged that the survey was as stark confirmation of the seriousness of the crisis. &quot;The government has no illusions about the scale of the problem we are facing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - National team goalkeeper James Phiri has predicted that Zambia will pull through the Sudan hurdle and qualify to the next stage of the Africa qualifying series for the 1998 World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sudan is a very tough team and the game will be tough, but we shall still qualify.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We cannot afford to lose to them twice especially that we lost in the away game,&quot; said Phiri in an interview at the Hotel Intercontinental in Lusaka yesterday shortly after the team arrived from Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phiri, who acted as the team's skipper in the Sudan match, observed that no excuses could be made over Zambia's 2-0 defeat in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sudan just outplayed us, they are actually a better team than we expected,&quot; said Phiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But national team trainer, Roald Poulsen refused to give any comments on the match nor his plans for the return match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not want to talk on the game because we need time to rest before we start talking. But what I can say is that we shall resume training on Sunday and all players that played in Sudan will not play for their clubs this weekend,&quot; said Poulsen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And John Fashanu, Zambia's soccer agent for management, arrived with the national team yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Congratulations to UNZASU and the student body for preserving the integrity of the history of the University of Zambia as the depository of the last resort of ideals and principles of equality, liberty and fraternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was with a sense of total despair that I received the news of a planned solidarity march to State House by students for the purpose of celebrating the enactment of the MMD constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immoral procession was a betrayal of student ideals and sacrifice for the common good across the world. The Chinese students massacred in cold blood in Tianamen Square for demanding rights such as those taken away from Zambians by the MMD, Steve Biko, civil rights movements of the sixties at universities in America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearer home Ronald Penza, Super SAP Capitalist, sacrificed his government scholarship and worked his way through university by demanding of the UNIP government that they close the French Embassy for selling arms to apartheid South Africa.Betrayal of the ideals of Justice and Fair Play came with his job as an MMD politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Derick Chitala's ideals as a student made him an architect of the Garden House Meeting - his vision only became clouded when he became a Minister in the MMD government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Azwell Banda sacrificed ten years of his life working as an unqualified school teacher and only completed his degree as an old man rather than apologise to KK as was required of him which would have destroyed the standing of UNZA as a custodian of community ideals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Caine Mweemba is living in a servants quarter in order to uphold the history of the student movement in the world as the vanguard in the never ending struggle for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many others whose names are not known but who have sacrificed the hope of a lustrous career because as students they chose to stand for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The duty of the University as the custodian of community ideals cannot be sold for 30 pieces of silver in the manner that the 16 or so Judas Iscariots who marched to State House did. Those students are intelligent enough to appreciate the fact that the Republican Constitution is not an MMD issue. And the best they could have done in their exercise of their constitutional right to free association would have been to join Chawinga and company in the dance at State House on May 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a country such as ours, in which Parliament has been corrupted, we can survive; the judiciary has been emasculated and we stagger on; Francis Ndlovhu is a political stooge who is doing everything possible to destroy the police service but sooner rather than later he will answer for it and the Police Service will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a nation cannot survive the corruption of its University as clearly evidenced by the Rwandan experience where the privileged Tutsi university students rioted against the democratically elected Hutu President in that country's first free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was that unjust action by the students that ignited the tragedy that is Rwanda today, the genocide of 2 million people which included almost the entire student body and effectively sounded the death knell of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was with Rwanda in mind that on Saturday morning, I went to my favourite newspaper vendor. I returned home to view my certificate at it's usual pride of place, a proud Zambian and UNZA graduate. My children are looking after their today and tomorrow against those politicians that would seek to cheapen the proud history of UNZA, by enlisting students to support injustice and division that can only point to the death of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I notice that UNZA and Zambia is safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I salute you all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Paramilitary officers were on Sunday morning clobbered by University of Zambia (UNZA) students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A mob of irate UNZA students stoned several paramilitary officers and detained four others in the wake of confusion which has rocked the Great East Road campus since June 7 when 22 pro-MMD students marched to State House in support of the constitutional amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paramilitary officers were deployed at the rooms of students who had gone to State House, a move which students perceived as &quot;intimidation by government&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba was reported as having assured the students who went to State House protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the paramilitary officers officers were forced out of the residential area and in the confusion a woman officer was severely beaten and disarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several paramilitary officers were severely injured and had to run for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And even after burning the belongings of 9 of the 22 MMD activists, students have vowed that they will not allow those students who went to State House to enter campus again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not going to allow any of them to enter the campus again,&quot; declared a group of students. &quot;If anyone attempts to come, he or she will be burnt to death.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Emmanuel Tembo said in an interview yesterday the MMD cadres had offended all the other students whose good name they had attempted to tarnish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The offence of binding the whole student body to the statement that it was in favour of the constitution has been committed on all students,&quot; Tembo said, &quot;and it is only them who will decide whatever punishment to impose on all those who marched to State House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo also claimed that most of the people who marched to State House were street vendors mobilised by MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Top in the group of the students who marched to State House are UNZA MMD Henry Malikyama who is also a relative of President Chiluba's private secretary Fabian Mumba, Bruno Lungu, George Chilengwe, Daudeni Phiri, Faith Kolala, Victor Tembo, chairperson for UNZA MMD ladies Martha Mwansa, Sandra Sisya (Zelu). Several MMD documents and campaign materials were found in their rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNZASU vice president Joseph Munsanje dismissed the allegations by the pro-MMD group leader Henry Malikyama that students who were against their solidarity march are being used by the opposition and said students were are not divided on the constitution as it has been potrayed in the governmnet owned and controlled media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What MMD should know is that UNZASU has been operating even before the opposition parties came into being and it has its own way of reacting to issues,&quot; Musanje said in an interview yesterday. &quot;The student populace is not in support of the constitution as can be seen by their reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A thirty day ban on all exports of scrap metal was announced by mines deputy minister Ackim Nkole in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press briefing yesterday Nkole said that the ban was effective from yesterday and was aimed at facilitating the &quot;cleaning up&quot; of the scrap metal dealers association's operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No scrap metal inspection certificates will be issued with effect from today,&quot; Nkole said, &quot;there will be no exports of scrap metal for a period of thirty days.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkole said that during the ban period, scrap metal licenses would not be processed and there will be a review of all licenses issued out and scrutiny of applications before issuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkole revealed in an interview that despite several successful arrests in cases of copper thefts there had been no prosecutions which he attributed to an incompetent police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The law provides for stiff penalties. The offender is liable to 15 years imprisonment but no one has been prosecuted despite the many arrests,&quot; Nkole carped. &quot;It is incompetence to send a starving prosecutor to an offender because he will just be given whisky and the case is no more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further called for the re-classification of the copper thefts charge as a capital offence so as to scrap bail which enabled the offenders to manipulate all evidence against them allowing them to go scot free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Scrap Metal Dealers' association was however divided over the ban with some members calling for a grace period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is need for the ministry to allow us about two weeks to clear off our stock and meet some conditions of some contracts we've gone into with our partners abroad,&quot; scrap dealer Kambwili Chishimbwe suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Scrap Metal Dealers Association welcomed the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an interview yesterday the association vice chairman, Chris Kelari, thanked the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has been lenient to us, a 30 day ban is better than forever and we are happy that now the government is working towards formally recognising us,&quot; Kelari said</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NSCZ chairman Patrick Chamunda, indicated that though his office is yet to be briefed on the problems between the two darts groupings, he will call for a meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't as yet got any information of any problems in darts, but if there are any problems, we will surely have to sit down to resolve the issue,&quot; said Chamunda said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Lusaka district darts league fixtures secretary, Teddy Sambaka, insisted that the darts mother body had personalised the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have nothing against the mother body but the problem is that some people within DAZ want to personalise the issue. We are ready to resolve the matter but we may be faced to ask the Sports Council to help us resolve the issue if anything is done on the part of DAZ,&quot; Sambaka said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Tempers flared at the interparty meeting in Kitwe last Friday, as opposition parties and the ruling MMD clashed over recent threats of donor aid cuts, sending the meeting into disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The highly charged meeting attended by the MMD, UNIP, ZDC, National Party and Movement for Democratic Process (MDP) failed to come up with resolutions after 12 hours of heated arguments over recent calls by some opposition parties for a donor aid squeeze against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition parties, led by the National Party, refused to budge when MMD proposed that a communique be jointly signed by all opposition parties condemning recent threats by the donor community of aid cuts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not going to be hoodwinked into legitimising a hostile and dictatorial government by appending our signatures to this trickery,&quot; National Party provincial chairman Simon Kunda charged immediately after MMD delegation leader Kaunda Lembalemba made the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD maintained that unless the communique was signed, they would not accept all the other resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is either you take this resolution by the MMD who in this case are in majority, or we forget about this inter party meeting all altogether,&quot; Lembalemba argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lembalemba further accused the opposition of not adhering to the principles of democracy, among which was tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the opposition was not deterred by Lembalemba's threats and maintained that unless the MMD reasoned with them on the matter, they would not mind forgetting about the meeting as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MMD should learn to reason and not suppress other parties' views, otherwise there is no need for sitting in conference rooms talking to an adamant and disrespectful party like the MMD,&quot; ZDC Copperbelt Provincial senator, James Chilemu, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president, Alfred Zulu, was left with no alternative but to postpone the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD and opposition party cadres kept on jeering and chanting slogans in support of their own stances with the ruling party members accusing their colleagues from the opposition of being unpatriotic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the meeting was adjourned MMD members shouted abuse at the opposition leaders and continued singing and denouncing the donor community for threatening aid cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angry MMD cadres later started singing that since the talks had failed the solution was to fight it out so that the winners would be left to rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MDP president Chama Chakomboka said he was disappointed with the conduct of the MMD, saying the country was quickly drifting into a one party monopoly state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba's government has been accused by Amnesty International, a human rights organisation, of &quot;playing political games&quot; by detaining UNIP leaders on charges of treason which is punishable by death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International, in a facsimile message to The Post on Friday and distributed to various political leaders on Saturday, said the arrest and detention of the eight UNIP leaders, who include vice-president senior chief Inyambo Yeta, might have been politically motivated and for that reason the international community would keep an eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The international community will be closely watching to see what evidence has been collected in support of making these arrests on suspicion of treason,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International demanded that if the UNIP leaders are being detained simply because of political differences they should be released immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If these men are, indeed, being held because of opposing the President politically, Amnesty International would consider them prisoners of conscience and would demand their immediate and unconditional release,&quot; the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International wondered how the eight could be linked to the clandestine Black Mamba which was responsible for a spate of bomb blasts and threats because when their homes were searched by police who were apparently looking for bomb-making materials, guns or incriminating documents, no evidence was reportedly found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Amnesty international's concerns are heightened by lack of concrete evidence to justify these arrests which lends weight to the organisation's fear the real reason for these men's detention is to prevent them from carrying out non-violent political activity in line with their beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Is there enough evidence to hold them without chance of bail at Lusaka Central Prison which has notoriously poor conditions?&quot; wondered the human rights organisation, whose secretariat is in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted, police spokesman, Francis Musonda, declined to talk about the detention saying &quot;it is already in court&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International, however, called for the detainees to receive a fair and prompt trial in accordance with international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said it was also aware that police were seeking to make further arrests and was concerned that there might also be political motives as what happened in 1993 when several UNIP members were wrongfully detained in connection with The Zero Option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Barotse cultural Association at a mass rally by opposition parties on Saturday condemned the detentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chiluba can't respect any traditional leadership because he does not know where he comes from,&quot;charged BCA publicity secretary, Mutungulu Wangu.  &quot;Kaunda never hid his background that is why he respected traditional rulers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition parties have praised the donor community for withholding aid to Zambia and are now calling for frontline states to close their borders to government traffic and bar delegations from attending regional conferences until good governance is upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This agreement was announced at a mammoth rally attended by eight political parties near Kafue round-about on Saturday. The rally, which had police mounting the largest security operation in the political history of the country, saw 700 paramilitary police officers, a hundred of whom were armed, 14 on horseback and two supporting helicopters monitoring the proceedings on the ground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We mounted this operation to protect them and to show anyone with ill intentions that they cannot do so,&quot; Wynter Kabwiku, officer commanding Lusaka Division said, adding: &quot;We have been liaising with the organisers of this rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) did not attend but its Eastern Province Senator, Andrew Banda, who attended in his individual capacity apologised for the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda wished he had traveled to Lusaka earlier to convince other leaders about the importance of unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint opposition statement read by Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, said: &quot;We salute the donor community for finally heeding the calls of the oppressed people of Zambia, that they prefer to live in abject poverty as is the case now than under a donor funded dictatorial oligarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We call upon the front line states to close their borders to Zambian government traffic and ostracise its delegations to regional conferences until the government is seen to be upholding the principles of good governance that brought them into power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition also said they would not honour the newly amended constitution until it was adopted by a constituent assembly and a National Referendum or else the 1996 elections be held under the 1991 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also demanded for the immediate re-registration of voters and that the one done by Nikuv Computers Limited of Israel be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also demanded for an independent electoral commission whose composition should be accepted by all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We challenge the constitutionality of the Public Order (Amendment) Act, 1996 and demand its immediate repeal,&quot; resolved the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also expressed displeasure at the provocative adverts made by government leaders in the public media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also decided that police should not superintend the elections and that no MMD cadre should be recruited in the police service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the beginning of the rally police officers, mostly youthful recruits who were commanded to surround the assemblage met with overpowering resistance prompting their commanders to withdraw them to Kafue Road side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda, disturbed by the police, took it upon himself to talk to the commanding officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the crowd former president Kaunda demanded to know who was selling copper and cobalt for ZCCM since the closure of MEMACO and why President Chiluba was clinging to the Gabon and the Mukwela Rail Disaster reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What does he want to do with those reports? See now another rail disaster has occured in Kapiri Mposhi, we must know what is causing these accidents,&quot; Kaunda demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said under any circumstance he would face and defeat President Chiluba in the elections and that would be when the President would account for the &quot;sins&quot; of his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the leaders present at the rally condemned the detention of the UNIP leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Operations of the Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA) will not be affected by the withdrawal of donor aid, assured its chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitalu said the agency, which has been supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), would be able to sustain its operations from the present funds collected from the sale of companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The programme is sufficiently advanced to be able to sustain the privatisation of state enterprises if the donors were to withdraw their aid now ,&quot; said Chitalu. &quot;But donor aid has been of great help to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitalu also disclosed that the agency was expecting two more trading groups , along the lines of the Shoprite chain, to open up shops in the country. But he could not disclose which country they were coming from. It is, however, believed that the two are South African chains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitalu announced that Choma Milling had been sold to A B Georgitsis and R.L Musenge of Nshima Milling at a price of K1 billion. An initial deposit of K450 million, being 45 per cent of the purchase price, has been paid to the Privatisation Revenue Account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The balance of K550 million, or 55 per cent, will be paid over a period of six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZPA has also sold Kabwe Industrial Fabrics, a 100 per cent state owned enterprise manufacturing a variety of industrial packaging materials, to Tate and Lyle, a UK based multinational corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulungushi Sawmilling and Joinery of Kitwe has been bought by Lusaka's former mayor Fisho Mwale and Siteke Mwale at K300 million. A 20 per cent deposit has been paid while the balance will be paid in a period of three months</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - South African journalists have launched a national and international campaign to forestall the impending closure of South Africa's state funded external shortwave broadcasting station, Channel Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of the committee set up to spear head the campaign, Promise Lekalake, said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg yesterday that the overwhelming majority of journalists in South Africa favour the continuation of the station as it is viewed as a national asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is regretful that an organisation like Channel Africa which was so active in promoting and developing understanding of South Africa's position in Africa has to be the subject of closure,&quot; Lekalake carped.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Lekalake, Channel Africa &quot;reigned supreme during the apartheid era&quot; and wondered why it should be closed now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is sending wrong messages,&quot; Lekalake said. &quot;It boils down to politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, in a press statement sent to The Post , SABC radio chief executive, Govin Reddy, observed that Channel Africa is a comprehensive and authentic African communications forum which serves Africa from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is totally objective and credible and reliable. It is dedicated to the promotion of positive development in Africa and is committed to the enhancement of dialogue and co-operation between all African people as their channel of goodwill,&quot; Reddy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African foreign affairs minister, Alfred Nzo, announced last month that the station would be closed as no provisions for funds had been made in his ministry's budget for 1996/97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Channel Africa was first established in 1966 as Radio RSA but repositioned itself as Channel Africa in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, the station has an estimated 15 million regular listeners and broadcasts in three Southern African languages (Chinyanja, Silozi and Xitsonga), one East African language (Kiswahili) , as well as in English, French and Portuguese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, according to Lekalake, the station employs several foreign journalists, among them Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet is meeting next week to put a seal to the decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Krahn militia, who were resisting an attempt by Liberia's Council of State to arrest Johnson on murder charges, had been holed up in the barracks for the past two and half months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighters refused to board the 13 trucks provided by Ecomog, the West African peacekeeping force, for transportion to their various destinations.  They walked out of the centre in high spirits, singing and clapping.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to the withdrawal, witnessed by United States embassy staff, and the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), Ulimo-J spokesman Madison Wion turned over an assortment of over 50 assault rifles to Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wion said the weapons had been captured from the rival National Patriotic Front of Liberia and Ulimo-J during the recent fighting in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the handing over of the weapons was in compliance with a request from Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) that Ulimo-J hand over all arms in its possession to Ecomog by Tuesday and also withdraw from the training centre by the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wion said, however, that although it had been agreed that all the warring factions withdraw from the safe haven of Monrovioa, Ulimo-J fighters would comply only if Charles Taylor's NPFL withdraws his forces from Kakata, Todee and Bong mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said these areas had been seized from Ulimo-J in contravention of the Abuja (Nigeria) accord which states that all factions must remain in the positions they occupied at its signing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wion said Ulimo-J would return all weapons seized from Ecomog during the fighting in Tubmanburg in December last year as soon as the highway to the town is reopened to enable them return to their headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The withdrawal of Krahn fighters from the Barclay Training Centre coincides with the launching of an operation by Ecomog to make Monrovia a gun-free society.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - A lost fly whisk belonging to detained Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta of the Lozi ethnic group, in western Zambia, has caused uproar among traditionalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fly whisk, a symbol of traditional authority among Lozi chiefs, is feared to have been misplaced or lost in the wake of Yeta's detention last week for alleged treason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The independent weekly newspaper, The Sun, reported Monday that the counselors of traditional chiefs, who constitute the Barotse Kuta, the Royal Court, met last week in the regional headquarters of Mongu to discuss, among others, the fate of the namaya, or fly whisk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By tradition, all Lozi chiefs carry the namaya as the symbol of their power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the counsellors at the meeting, quoted by the newspaper, it is taboo for the fly whisk to be handled by a commoner. It is one of the most respected symbols of chieftainship in the Lozi tradition. A chief without the namaya in hand is not respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yeta, who is the senior chief of Sesheke District in western Zambia, is the son of the Litunga, the paramount chief, Ilute Yeta of Western Province.  He and his father once served in the former government of Kenneth Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inyambo Yeta appeared in court for mention for treason, last week, without his namaya. He wore jeans-like attire. This was in contrast to his usual immaculate two piece suits, a hat complete with the namaya in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now police must explain where Inyambo Yeta's fly whisk is, otherwise we Lozis will sue Chiluba's government for disgracing our tradition,&quot; said Sepiso Muliokela, a Lozi who hawks his wares in one of the city's markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the new constitution, Chiluba has legislated against chiefs' participation in politics unless they resign their posts. He has said that it is not in order for chiefs to be &quot;insulted and humiliated&quot; in the &quot;dirty game of politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most chiefs, including Yeta, have however challenged the law. They say they should decide whether or not to involve themselves in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yeta is deputy leader of the United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former President Kenneth Kaunda. He is being detained with seven other party leaders and supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, he emerged from the court smiling and flashing the two-finger UNIP &quot;victory&quot; sign. It did not appear that he was in the least worried about the &quot;missing&quot; fly whisk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many other Zambian traditional chiefs also carry fly whisks. They are made mainly from the hairy end of a cow's or ox tail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The whisk is occassionally handled by chiefs' retainers to ward off flies or other undesireable insects from a relaxing chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Yeta is locked up in Chimbokaila prison in the capital, Lusaka, while his Lozi traditional counsellors fret and frisk over the &quot;sacred&quot; chiefs fly whisk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best-known fly whisk belonged to Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta and another to Malawian President Hastings Kamuzu Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya's current president, Daniel Arap Moi, carries a small knobkerry.  Kaunda, on his part, does not part with a white handkerchief which he keeps clutched between two fingers of his left hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike Banda and Moi, Kaunda says the cloth has nothing to do with show of &quot;power.&quot; The handkerchief is a symbol of &quot;love and goodwill among the human race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several years before he lost power, Kaunda almost caused a rumpus at his official state house residence in Lusaka when he briefly &quot;lost&quot; the handkerchief. Reporters at the state luncheon and other guests saw an impatient Kaunda pace up and down angrily shouting at his securitymen: &quot;Where is my handkerchief, where is my handkerchief?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had accidentally placed it under an empty plate while he served lunch to his guests, including journalists. He smiled broadly after it was retrieved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambian traditionalists are demanding the release of a their chief detained by the government for alleged treasonable offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Barotse Cultural Association, which maintains close links with the Lozi Royal Establishment in Zambia's western province, demanded Monday the immediate and unconditional release of Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yeta, vice-president of the opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), has been detained with seven others for alleged involvement in a terror campaign by the clandestine &quot;Black Mamba&quot; group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an open to President Frederick Chiluba, the association said the detention was malicious and designed to ruin the chief's standing, particularly among his people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Barotse Cultural Association, having considered the circumstances leading to the unlawful detentions of Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta and seven others, do hereby demand their immediate and unconditional release,&quot; said the association in the letter to Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yeta and the seven others from UNIP, which is led by former President Kenneth Kaunda, were arrested and charged with treason last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are alleged to have participated in a spate of bombings by the Black Mamba. The group launched its campaign of terror after government's adoption of a controversial constitution that bars Kaunda from contetsing Zambia's 1996 presidential elections, on the grounds that he had foreign parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The constitution also bars traditional chiefs from participating in active party politics, unless they abdicate their psotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The association also told Chiluba that it considered the chief a prisoner of conscience whose detention had been politically motivated. It pledged to continue supporting both his political position and chieftainship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A Lozi chief remains one for life as long as that chief does not violate the Lozi customary law. The Barotse Cultural Association and many other concerned ma-Lozi (Lozis), who have closely followed Senior Chief Inyambo's political career and philosophy, shall continue to rally behind him and ensure his success, regardless of what government may do,&quot; the association said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International, said Saturday it would launch a campaign for the release of the detainees whom it said it considered as prisoners of conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message to Kaunda Saturday, which the UNIP leader read at an opposition political parties meeting in the capital, Amnesty accused Chiluba's government of &quot;playing political games&quot; by arresting opponents and said that it would watch developments in the matter &quot;carefully.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leaders of eight opposition parties represented at Saturday's meeting reiterated, in a joint declaration, their opposition to the new constitution and demanded its immediate repeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also repeated the call for a constituent assembly and referendum to adopt the country's supreme law and that this year's general elections be held under the 1991 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties commended the donor community for heeding appeals to deny aid to the Chiluba government and appealed to the Southern African Frontline States to close their borders to government traffic. They also urged neighboring states to bar Zambian government officials from regional meetings and conferences until the government agrees to respect human rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any minister now is ruled out of politics, for at least up to the year 2003, from present calculations, to avoid partisanship,&quot; the News Agency of Nigeria quoted him as saying in his Amaigbo country-home, in eastern Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The administration of Gen. Sani Abacha is implementing a 36- month transition programme to democracy. It is due to be completed October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government had given ministers wishing to join politics to resign by October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore, Ofonagoro said, it would be &quot;futile&quot; for any minister now to nurse political ambitions. He said the measure was designed to ensure an unbiased and credible transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot be an umpire and at same time participate in the celebration of victory,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to commit ourselves to ensure a smooth process of handing over, and this should be seen as call to national service.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana - Ghana has repeated earlier warnings that she will no longer tolerate any ship carrying refugees into her waters, saying any captain who violates the warning will face prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking Sunday to the Ghana News Agency in Accra, deputy minister of foreign affairs, Mohamed Ibn Chambas, said &quot;our position has not changed. We will not accept any refugee ship any more, we have had enough.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Ghanaian port officials have been made aware of this position and will not allow any such ship to dock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chambas was reacting to press reports that negotiations were going on between Ghana and the United Nations on the plight and possible acceptance of refugees on a Russian vessel, Zolotitsa, which has been at sea for the past 12 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chambas said Ghana had not been approached to take the vessel carrying about 400 refugees and warned that the captain will face prosecution if he docked at a Ghanaian port without authorisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vessel, which arrived at the Takoradi anchorage on Friday, was towed out of Ghanaian territorial waters the following day under Navy escort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States has urged countries along the west African coast, especially Togo, Benin and Nigeria, to accept the ship which relief officials said was in poor condition and had run short of food, water and medicine, &quot;for humanitaian reasons&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zolotitsa was sent back to sea on Wednesady by Togolese authorities, after they had given it some assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of Liberians have been making desperate efforts to flee renewed fighting in their country, but West African countries are reluctant to take them, saying it will trigger a mass exodus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, Ghana bowed to intense diplomatic pressure and accepted about 2,000 refugees brought in by a rusty Nigerian freighter, Bulk Challenge, after a 10-day drama at sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a special delegation from Ghana, chairman of the 16- nation Economic Community of West African States, is in Liberia for a new round of negotiations to speed up moves to stop the fighting.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote d'ivoire - The African Development Bank has embarked on a long and tortuous road to local and international respectability, in the process laying the groundwork for longer term changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of this is due to austere measures adopted by the bank's new president, Morrocan Omar Kabbaj and his advisers in this first year of his tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank's corporate governance, nature and style of executive management and credit policies, have all come under intense scrutiny and alterations, with the most visible being the removal of 250 staff early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been four strands to the reform programme: measures to improve bank lending, tighter controls over loan arrears and administrative costs, new organisational structure and efforts to improve institutional governance of the bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Kabbaj surveys results of the re-organisation, he promises &quot;the worst is behind us&quot;, and the bank needs to surge forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This restructuring was not my own idea. But morale is improving and I think staff are emerging from the trauma of re-organisation,&quot; said Kabbaj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, administrative costs, which however still lag behind World Bank standards, have been lowered by 15 percent from a percentage of loan portfolio of 1.3 percent in 1992 to 0.99 percent in 1993 compared with the World Bank's record of 0.6 percent in 1992-93.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The depths to which the bank had sunk and the radical changes being implemented initially depressed staff morale but observers say it has dissipated fears about the survival of the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADB donors from western industrialised countries scrambled, at the bank's annual meeting at the end of May, to put together a 2.6 billion-dollar package to replenish the exhausted coffers of the bank's soft-loan arm -- the African Development Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another psychological boost also came from the newest member -- South Africa -- which promised to become the first African country to contribute to the Fund and expressed &quot;a historic obligation to debunk the all too-pervasive Afro-pessimism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A much relieved Kabbaj then declared the bank would open for business now that donors have pledged to replenish the ADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donors will meet again in the Japanese town of Osaka this month, stretching the long-search for funds for the poorest members of the group comprising 53 African and 24 non-African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Lipton, who represents the United States at the ADB, pledged to push Congress to approve its 200-million-dollar contribution to replenish fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Lipton had earlier said the ADB was dysfunctional, he changed his heart, saying &quot;under Kabbaj it had turned the corner. In a incredibly short period of time, he has made sweeping changes and brought a fresh start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabbaj also plans to impose severe sanctions on bad debtors though he admits it may take a major political initiative to resolve the problem which has been described as &quot;ticklish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arrears will for the first time be considered on the same basis as those of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of delinquents who have fallen into long-term arrears totalling more than 800 million dollars has risen to five from three during the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola and Cameroon are newcomers to the list which also includes Liberia, Sudan and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The five cases are in chronic state which may require political intervention at the highest level,&quot; says Kabbaj.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cases are now scheduled to be discussed when African Heads of State meet early in July in Libreville, Gabon, to debate the ADB'S future prior to the annual Organization of African Unity summit, in neighboring Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ADB has also approved a revised arrears policy with tighter sanctions and a more rigorous application of directives on cancellation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also moved from specific to general provisioning and moves are underway to clean up non-performing loans. Other measures of financial management such as new currency and interest rate policies are scheduled to be discussed by the ADB board later in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of re-organization, the bank has started wide-ranging new training programs aimed first at 70 percent of managers who have risen through the ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Korn Ferry, a UK-based consultancy, will assist the bank with specialised new recruitment to fill all available professional positions by the end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a problem of culture in the bank that will not be corrected overnight. We have to work, in my view, for another 18 months to two years to change that,&quot; Kabbaj said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To tighten accountability and transparency, three more accountants are being attached to the ADB president's office to ensure all financial outflows are made in conformity with bank regulations and procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Some have said Africa is a lost hope. Others have said Africa cannot make it. I say, Africa cannot afford not to make it,&quot; said Aleke Banda, Malawi's governor to the ADB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But perhaps the litmus test in the bank's revival is the sticking issue of institutional governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most African countries are opposed to industrialized states increasing their shareholding, warning &quot;the bank will lose its African identity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This issue comes in the wake of a radical report prepared by a three-man panel comprising retired Asian Development Bank vice president, Gunther Schulz, former Africa director of IMF, Mamadou Toure and ex-senior Kenyan treasurer, Harris Mule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report presents four options for restructuring the bank's capital base, the first of which includes allowing non-African shareholders equal shares with the African owners of the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank officials say implementation of the report's recommendations will be a key factor in determining the size of the forthcoming general capital increase and a key condition in the release of resources for the replenishment of the ADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African shareholders of the bank led by Nigeria, Egypt, Libya and Cote d'Ivoire control two-thirds of its African share capital. The so-called non-regionals own one-third of the capital of the ADB and 50 percent of the capital of the ADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is substantial African opposition to any attempt by non- regional shareholders to increase either managerial control or equity in the bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's finance minister, Anthony Ani, warns against &quot;attempts to steal the bank&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Thirty-six more Nigerian banks have run into trouble, bringing the number of distressed banks in the country to 60, according to a recent corporate finance report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bankers in Lagos said currently some 52 percent of the commercial and merchant banks in the country were insolvent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report on &quot;Financial Indices on Distressed Banks as at December 1995&quot;, said the 60 troubled banks, included 33 merchant banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Central Bank of Nigeria has been involved in some rescue operation, and recently acquired six commercial banks. Last year, the apex bank took over 17 banks and handed them over to new managements as part of the rescue mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said the troubled banks held deposits amounting to 93.5 billion naira (82.5 naira=1 USD). Only 52.6 billion naira or 56 percent of the amount was covered by the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to bankers, claimants of uninsured deposits may not be able to receive compensation if the failed banks go into liquidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least, seven executives of failed Nigerian banks have been sent to prison under a government decree, aimed at sanitizing the financial system.  Some 200 other bank executives are in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said as at December 1995, the troubled banks had loaned some 57 billion naira, mainly to insiders, notably directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only about 3.08 billion naira or 5.4 percent of the loans had been recovered, while another 35.8 billion naira is listed as &quot;non-performing&quot; funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, bankers claimed that another major problem facing the financial houses in Nigeria was the rising crime wave and incessant bank raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only between 10 and 15 percent of the total money in circulation was in the banking system, because citizens no longer considered banks safe enough to keep money, the bankers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military government, however. says its has stepped up anti-crime meassures to arrest the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mines minister, Kelly Walubita, in a recent statement said that the companies had so far invested some two million dollars in exploration, prospecting and mining, mainly in the mineral-rich northern and northwestern parts of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The companies include, Gencor of South Africa, Western Mining of Australia and Phelps Dodge.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - A United Nations official has said that there is need to conduct a study to find out why pregnant African mothers weigh less compared to others in Europe and America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the official opening of the workshop on &quot;trainer of trainers in lactation management&quot; Tuesday, the acting U.N. Childrens Fund representative to Zambia, Marashetty Seenappa, said it was critical for pregnant mothers to gain weight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that a study found that in America pregnant mothers put on 35.6 pounds, in the United Kingdom 24.2 while in Tanzania it was 19.8 and Uganda 17.6 pounds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why the wide viriation? May be it is economical or lack of care but lets not speculate, it is important to find out the reasons behind this,&quot; Seenappa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weight gain, he said, was fundamental to pregnant mothers since breast-feeding guaranteed 300 calories per day for a baby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a senior socio-anthropologist in Zambia has said that 13 percent of the country's babies are exclusively breast-fed between zero to two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funny Kondolo told PANA Tuesday in Lusaka that although about 98 percent of Zambian mothers breast-feed, the infant feeding method is not practiced exclusively for six months, as advised by scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kondolo said that a consultancy team was working on a breast-feeding policy to be submitted July to the Ministry of Health. The policy suggests that employees provide creches at worksites so that mothers could breast-feed their babies during tea and lunch breaks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that if adopted, the policy would compel employers to extend maternity leave from three to four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officially opening the workshop, the ministry of community development and social welfares' assistant secretary, Meselina Hampango, said one of the causes of child death was poor nutrition. she said that this condition was due to poor child feeding practices coupled with general poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the high child mortality rates and infant and under five years mortality rates were 123 and 202 per 1,000 in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-week workshop, which opened Tuesday, is aimed at adopting breast-feeding practices which will increase knowledge in advantages off breast-feeding in relation to child survival and safe motherhood.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs said in a dispatch to PANA Tuesday that the meeting would be hosted by the Canadian minister of international cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. department said the meeting will discuss the situation in Burundi, &quot;in a bid to secure a common approach amongst donors and U.N.  agencies in support of peace negotiations and aid issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Violence started in Rwanda on Oct.1, 1990, when the sons of Tutsi exiles living in Uganda fought their way into Rwanda, in a bid to topple the government of the late President Gen. Juvenal Habyarimana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The violence turned into genocide when Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed in a mysterious plane crash before landing in Kigali. In the revenge killing which followed, Hutus massacred up to a million of people from the Tutsi minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The genocide ended when the Rwandan exiles from Uganda, known as the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), defeated the government army in Kigali. At least two million Hutu were forced to flee into exile, to escape the RPF's advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burundi, violence was sparked off by the assassination of the first Hutu to be democratically elected, Melchior Ndadaye, allegedly by rogue Tutis soldiers, on Oct.21, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death toll since Ndadaye died is estimated at 100,000 people, both Tutsi's and Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the U.N. humanitarian affairs department, the meeting in Geneva will bring together donors, U.N. Agencies and the Organization of African Unity (OAU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The discussions will focus on a possible program of development support for Burundi, the review of contingency planning and consideration of initiatives which might support Burundian leaders in their dialogue by &quot;broadening the constituency for peace in the country.&quot; the U.N. dispatch added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The donors meeting will be held amid signs of aggravating tension between the majority Hutu and minority Tutsi, who control the armed forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This tension, including rumors of a coup d'etat, results from the failure by Burundi's leaders to reach a consensus on ways to end the violence, which has lasted for more than two years and a half since Ndadaye' death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting in Geneva will come barely two weeks after the collapse of the second round of peace negotiations in Mwanza, involving the Hutu-dominated ruling Burundi Democratic Front (FRODEBU) and the country's former Tutsi-dominated sole party, the Union for National Progress (UPRONA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FRODEBU favours the inclusion of Hutu rebels, grouped under the National Committee for the Defence of Democracy or CNDD of former Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma, in the peace negotiations, moderated by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, UPRONA, whose Tutsi soldiers reportedly assassinated Ndadaye, categorically rejects that position, saying this would abrogate the &quot;government convention&quot; the two parties signed in July 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was under that &quot;power-sharing&quot; convention that the current president, Sylivestyre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu, was allowed to step into the shoes of the late Ndadaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That convention calls for the exclusion, from the reigns of power, of all Burundians who have been implicated in acts of violence. Among these is Nyangoma and his CNDD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Nyerere has warned the Burundians to seriously negotiate their differences, if they want to prevent a Rwanda-like blood-bath. At one time, he even said Nyangoma could take over power, in the same way Uganda's Yoweri Museveni stormed to power in January 1986.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KISORO, Uganda - Over 600 Zaireans of Tutsi ethnic group have reportedly crossed into Uganda's south-western Kisoro district, for fear of being attacked by exiled soldiers of the the defeated Rwanda government and the &quot;Interahamwe&quot;, a Hutu militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kisoro district chief administrative officer, Abdallah Kiganda, said Monday that the refugees started arriving last Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees were reportedly coming from eastern Zaire's Jomba area in Rucru zone, along with hundreds of heads of cattle and other property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kiganda said the refugees crossed through the Busanza border post and were camped at Nyakabande, four kilometres from Kisoro town on Ugandan territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday alone, Kiganda said, over 100 refugees with about 174 heads of cattle, crossed through Busanza, about 24 kilometres from the common border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The refugees, mainly people of the Tutsi ethnic group, say the Interahamwe have gone on the rampage since Thursday and have murdered a big number of their relatives,&quot; Kiganda told the PANA correspondent in Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Interahamwe is accused of being behind the killings during the 1994 massacres in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kiganda said the refugees reported that the attackers, armed with spears and pangas, had on Monday morning, murdered the Rucru zone assistant district officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His head was found hanging on a tree near Chengerere, about 10 kilometres from the Uganda side of the border, the official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have already contacted the ministry of local government and the UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) which have sent a team to assess the situation and we are expecting relief items tomorrow (Tuesday)&quot; Kiganda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Kisoro district commissioner, Asudu Lutale, had contacted his counterpart in the neighboring North Kivu province and discussed with him the possibility of allowing the refugees back to their areas of origin under protection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Emeka Ojukwu, erstwhile leader of the defunct Republic of Biafra, stirs the hornet's nest by declaring himself King of the Igbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man had done it before or something similar. That was in 1983, around the time of the gubernatorial and presidential elections. Emeka Ojukwu, erstwhile leader of the short-lived rebel Republic of Biafra, was deeply involved in the political maneuvers of the time as a member of the ruling National Party of Nigeria. Apparently to feather his political nest, Ojkwu, who had his eyes firmly fixed on the senate, took the title of Dike Di Ora Nma of Igboland. The title, which roughly translates into the beloved warrior of Igboland, was conferred on Ojukwu, who returned from over 10 years' self exile in Cote d'Ivoire in 1981, by a group of Igbo traditional rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The title immediately touched off a controversy. Nnamdi Azikiwe, then chairman and presidential candidate of the Nigerian Peoples Party, took on Ojukwu, denouncing his new title for being out of line with the Igbo standard of awarding chieftaincy titles. Zik was readily supported by his political disciples of Igbo origin such as Sam Mbakwe and Jim Nwobodo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the event, Ojukwu stuck to his guns and kept using the title until the novelty wore off. These days he hardly answers Dike Di Ora Nna of Igboland. Nor does he need to, for he has acquired a more treasured title - the Eze Igbo or King of the Igbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But since he took the title, -- reportedly his 90th -- Ojukwu has not known peace, nor has Igboland. The title and the circumstances surrounding its conferment have snowballed into something close to a scandal since May 19, when it was denounced by Oha-na-Eze, arguably the highest power welding body in Igboland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That day separate meetings of the council of elders and General Assembly of Oha-na-Eze, had been called to discuss the death and burial Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president, who died May 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the meetings, held at 7, Park Avenue, Enugu told Theweek that &quot;Ojukwu's leadership maneuvering&quot; dominated discussions. The Eze Igbo chieftancy title conferred on Ojukwu May 4 by Shedrack Mbanefo, an embattled Nri red cap chief, who lays claim to the Adama status of Nri, was hotly debated. Nri community in Njikoka Local Government Area of Anambra State is generally believed to be the origin and head of Igbo culture and tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics of Ojukwu's new title contend that under Igbo custom, no traditional ruler of any of the autonomous communities has the right to confer an all-encompassing chieftancy title on anybody no matter how highly placed. Another argument is that the people who conferred the title on Ojukwu have no authority to do so since &quot;they are merely the palace traditional servants of the traditional ruler of Nri, Eze Obidiegwu Onyesoh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Onyesoh believes that &quot;Ojukwu and Shedrach Mbanefo, Adama of Nri, committed an abomination against the gods of Nri.&quot; To prevent the abomination, Onyesoh had made spirited efforts to prevent Mbanefo from giving the title, and Ojukwu from taking it. His warning to all those invited to the conferment ceremony to stay away and avoid trouble worked, but only temporarily. On that day, May 4, over 100 anti-riot policemen led by a senior officer from Awka, the state capital, prevented the ceremony from holding at Akamkpisi Village Square, Nri. Determined to have the title, Ojukwu simply invited Mbanefo to his Is Uzor Street residence at Independence Layout, Enugu, where the title was eventually conferred on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Oha-na-Eze meeting of May 19 which discussed the unusual development attracted the cream of Igbo society. In attendance were Alex Ekweueme, former Nigerian vice-president; C.C. Onoh, one time governor of Old Anambra State; Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Champion publisher; Pius Okigbo, renowned economist; Jerome Udoji, an Industrialist, Nnia Nwodo, a second republic minister; and Ben Nwabueze, a professor of law and ex-secretary for education during the defunct Interim National Government. Others included Godwin Odenigwe, political adviser to Shehu Shagari, the Second Republic President; Bernard Onuegwunwoke, chairman, Imo State council of traditional rulers, who presided over the meeting; Chris Nwankwo, a former presidential aspirant; and one Aghanya, a colonel in the defunct Biafran army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek learnt that when Onoh, father of Biancah, Ojukwu's wife, raised the Eze Igbo title issue, members unanimously condemned Ojukwu for demanding and taking the title. The consensus was that the title does not exist in Igboland. According to sources, the Oha-na-Eze was told during the meeting that what Mbanefo had wanted to confer on Ojukwu was the title of Ofor Na Afor, but that Ojukwu convinced him to change the title to Eze Igbo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To buttress this allegation, the one who made it was said to have refered the gathering to Ojuwku's letter dated April 16, inviting his friends to grace the chieftancy installation ceremony on May 4 at Nri. After a heated debate on the issue, Onuegwunwoke called for suggestions on how to amicably settle the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aghanya reportedly advised that the matter be forgotten since the title merely exists in the minds of the Ojukwu and the man who conferred it on him.  Aghanya's counsel did not however, make sense to people like Nwodo, Onoh, Ekwueme, Nwabueze and Iwuanyanwu, all of whom recommended that Ojukwu should be sanctioned. They suggested rather sarcastically that since Ojukwu wanted a title at all cost, he should be conferred with the title of Eze Ogbunigwe, meaning &quot;king of mass destruction,&quot; a veiled reference to his activities as a civil war rebel head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the meeting, those who spoke in favour of Ojuwku argued that Eze Igbo has no territory or authority over anybody in Igboland. But they were defeated by those who maintained that in the eyes of outsiders, especially non-Igbo speaking people, Eze Igbo implies King of the Igbo, and that Ojukwu, who nurses presidential ambition, may be tempted to use it for political gains in future. Based on a suggestion by an unidentified person at the meeting, it was agreed that a newspaper advertisement be placed to disown the title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwabueze was asked to place the advert immediately. A suggestion that Ojukwu be stripped of other chieftancy titles earlier conferred on him by Igoba was dropped on popular demand. Those who recommended this sanction referred to Ojukwu's unguarded utterances on both local and national issues to justify their stand. They claimed that Ojukwu was refered to as Eze igbo at the Sultan's palace in Sokoto, during Ojukwu's recent visit to Muhammdadu Maccido, newly appointed sultan of Sokoto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a full page advert in the Daily Champion on May 23, which Ojukwu's supporters claimed was donated by Iwuanyanwu, Oha-na-Eze stated that the title of Eze Igbo does not exist and that no one is recognised as such by the Igbos. The organisation, &quot;noting that a member of the council of elders, Chief Chukwuemeka Odumegwu- Ojukwu, Ikemba of Nnewi, at some ceremony in his Enugu residence has had conferred on himself the title of Eze Igbo, which title is already being used in certain public announcements and publications, hereby state for the information of Nigeria authorities and the general public that the title of Eze Igbo does not exist,&quot; Ojukwu replied Oha-na-Eze four days later, at the third general assembly of his political association, the Nigerian Peoples Movement. At that meeting, held in Enugu, the Ikemba used more than one-and-a-half hours to dress down his opponents. Ojukwu: &quot;Oha-na-Eze has no leadership. Oha-na-Eze has no membership. The person who signed as the secretary-general of Oha-na-Eze in Champion newspaper, who elected him? Who did he defeat to emerge as the secretary-general and how many votes did he get?&quot; Ojukwu, who was visibly angry, told the gathering that Nwabueze failed to win election to represent his people in the constitutional conference and so could not lead them (his listeners) to Abuja. &quot;Together, I and you shall match to Aso Rock.&quot; Ojukwu enthused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to Iwuanyanwu, Ojuwi said that he was not bothered by unfriendly remarks on his person by those who donate newspaper space to run him down. He claimed that Iwuanyanwu had failed to execute all the road contracts awarded him by both the past and present governments in the country. Said Ojukwu: &quot;I will go to Abuja and I will recommend to the authorities to constitute a failed contracts tribunal quickly to try those who have failed to execute contracts given to them when the money had been fully paid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ekwueme was not spared by Ikemba Nnewi, who asked: &quot;What of the one who could not speak at the constitutional conference until I came to stand behind him to say whatever he wants?&quot; Ojukwu was obviously making reference to the constitutional conference days when the confusion generated by one of Ekwueme's speeches on the floor of the conference, Ojukwu came and stood behind him as a sign of solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he has an array of prominent Igbo sons to contend with, Ojukwu, it is believed, sees the contest for Igbo leadership as a straight fight between him and Ekwueme. In fact, Ojukwu's actions in recent times are seen by some people as part of his attempt to wrestle the leadership position from Ekwueme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the Ikemba told Theweek that the former Biafran leader is not comfortable with Ekwueme's domineering presence in Igbo affairs. The sources recalled that during the constitutional conference, Ekwueme was nominated to lead Igbo delegates, including Ojukwu. At the conference, Ekwueme, as Igbo leader, presented the Igbo position on all issues. During the burial, late last year, of Akanu Ibiam, former governor of defunct Eastern Region, despite Ojukwu's closeness with Sani Abacha, the head of state, Ekwueme was once more asked to lead the Igbo dignitaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in matters between the Igbos and other tribes in the country Ekwueme has always been placed first before Ojukwu. At the all-politicians' summit held last year in Lagos, Ojukwu was said to have been miffed that some of his followers did not oppose Ekwueme's position as chairman of the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if to reiterate Ekwueme's supremacy, the Oha-na-Eze meeting of May 19, appointed Ekwueme chairman of Zik's burial committee, with Ojukwu as one of the members of the committee. Sources close to the Ikembas, however, told Theweek that &quot;Ojukwu will attend Zik's burial as Eze Igbo whether they like it or not and not as member of the Oha-na-Eze,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ekwueme on his part, has been reluctant to join issues with Ojukwu.  Approached by Theweek, Ekwueme insisted that the matter was between Ojukwu and Oha-na-Eze and that he would not want to make personal comments on Ojukwu's utterances about him. &quot;Oha-na- Eze has said that the title does not exist and nobody holds such title in Igboland,&quot; said Ekwueme, &quot;What else do you want me to say?'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Run out of town by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, an increasing number of Nigerian drug merchants find a new haven in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musa Bamaiyi, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, must hear this: Hundreds of Nigerian drug traffickers driven out of the country by him and his boys have relocated to neighboring Ghana, from where they sneak in and out of town with the illegal stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TheWeek's investigations in Ghana showed that unable to use the airports anymore, an increasing number of Nigerian drug dealers now export cocaine and heroine to Ghana by road because of the porous nature of the boarders. With a few crisp naira and CFA notes doles out to security operatives and anti-narcotics officials at the borders, each of the drug dealers are allowed to enter Ghana with as much as a kilogram of cocaine or heroine.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On arriving in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, the drug merchants supply their Ghanaian and Nigerian retailers, who then take the drugs to the various joints at Tudu, Keneshie, Legon, Abeka-Lapaz and Nkrumah Circle in Accra, where they see a pinch for an equivalent of N250.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who sell outside Accra, in big towns like Kumasi, Tokoradi, Tamale, and Cape Coast, usually travel with the buses of either the State Transport Corporation or the Ghana Private Transport Union. They make the trips at night, when there are no policemen at the checkpoints to disturb them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the Nigerian drug dealers in Ghana told Theweek that &quot;the business is more lucrative here than in Nigeria because there are less people to settle.&quot; According to him, &quot;here, the policemen are more liberal and they don't ask for much to protect us. Most of them don't even know the true value of our trade. When you give them 50,000 cedis (about 2,500) they get so happy that they can protect you conveniently for a week. Whenever there is going to be a raid in Tudu, for instance, which is like the retail headquarters, we are quickly informed by our contact in the force, so we can avoid the area.  It is not like Nigeria. Here we hardly get burst.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ayo, another Nigerian drug dealer who lives a life of affluence in Accra, owning the latest car models, told Theweek that he was a trainee dealer in Lagos before his friend told him to try Accra about two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that at first, things were fairly hard for him, until he met a big buyer who owns a hotel in Accra. &quot;That man recruited me and sent me to Lagos twice a week to bring in market,&quot; revealed Ayo. &quot;In a year I made enough money to buy a BMW and a Honda Civic. I only had problem once at Seme border when a stubborn woman detective refuse to take kola. She insisted I must be searched. Eventually, I settled her with two thousand dollars and she chilled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ayo, who is now on his own, disclosed that his customers include military officers, wealthy businessmen, government officials and expatriates living in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That is why it is easy for me to make it big, because big guys pay bigger bucks for coke, because they need protection, which I give,&quot; said Ayo.  &quot;I sometimes hawk the stuff from office to office and from one big hotel to the other. When they desperately need it they call me on my mobitel, (mobile phone) and I deliver. Everything is cool.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Emeka, another Nigerian drug dealer, there are now over 300 Nigerians involved in the drug trade in Ghana. A few are wholesalers, while others, usually brothers, friends or recruits of the wholesalers, retail the illegal drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We Nigerians now prefer this end,&quot; Emeka explained. &quot;We don't make a hundred percent profit, sometimes less, but here there is no Bamaiyi to disturb us, so we can change our money to dollars, smuggle it to Nigeria and do something good with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the police headquarters along Kojo Thompson Road in Accra, a senior officer confirmed that Nigerians are involved in the dragon trade in Ghana, but quickly added that it is not only Nigerians who are engaged in the unlawful business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have caught Indians, Britons, Ghanaians and some other nationals here dealing in drugs, so we cannot single them (Nigerians) out even though people complain about them.&quot; said the officer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - A burst of gunfire stills Kudirat Abiola forever and shatters Nigeria's peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If my own child stand between the actualization of June 12, I will kill that boy because I believe so much in it. I will fight to the last pint of my blood. The almighty Allah is my hope for this struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those words uttered on the eve of the second anniversary of the voided presidential election of 1993 were to resonate with a brutal finality on Tuesday, June 4, a few days to the third anniversary. That morning, a burst of gunfire from yet-to-be identified assassins drained the last pint of blood, not from her son, but from Kudirat Abiola, 44, mother of seven and wife to the detained politician, Moshood Abiola.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat's last earthly sojourn began on a fast motion and with unusual occurrences. First, she woke up rather early. Babrinsa Jolaosho, her cook of four years was surprised to find her already seated in her living room so early, going through the dailies, her first chore of the day. Minutes later, she made for the bathroom for a wash during which Mercy Ette, an assistant editor with Newswatch, intent on booking an interview appointment with her came and left, without accomplishing her objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next was her meal. Jolaosho who had dashed to the kitchen soon emerged with a steaming plate of yam and stew, his madam's favourite breakfast. He was mistaken. Kudirat would have none of it. Instead she asked to be given just tea and then not in a cup as Jolaosho knew her to prefer, but in a jug.  In between taking her bath and emptying the jug of what turned out to be her last meal on earth, one or two visitors called which prompted Mark Adesina, her personal assistant who had also arrived the Abiola home to remind her boss of the 9 o'clock appointment she had to keep that morning. She quickly dismissed the visitors and dashed outside, Adesina in tow. Dauda Atanda Salami, her senior driver who had prepared the car and was already behind the wheels, threw the white Mercedes Benz 380 S class with registration number AA 73-ZAR into gear and sped off with Abiola's wife of 23 years to her fatal encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the party set out to keep the appointment, reportedly with Walter Carrington, the American ambassador to Nigeria, the car was flagged down by Celestine Okafor, a journalist on the political desk of the Punch newspapers who had unsuccessfully sought to gain entrance into the compound. Kudirat, her usual urbane and pleasant self, expressed regrets and asked the unrelenting newshound to call back by six o'clock that evening. She then offered Okafor who seemed to be going her way a lift in the car. He agreed and had almost opened the door to sit beside Kudirat when he hesitated. He suddenly remembered an appointment with Tony Momoh, former information minister. He declined the ride. Fate had intervened to save his life. With that interruption over, Dauda screeched into the main road of Toyin Street and passing through Allen Avenue joined the Obafemi Awolowo Way to the Lagos State secretariat. he was urged on by both Kudirat and Adesina who were conscious of the fact that they were already minutes late for the appointment with the diplomat. It was shortly after negotiating the 7-up bend and about to join the Lagos-Ibadan express road that tragedy struck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One account has it that the assailants used two cars, one a white BMW and the other a Peugeot 504 car which overtook Kudriat's car while the BMW provided a rear cover, perhaps to ensure that if the front car missed the target, the occupants of those in the rear would complete the dastardly act.  As it happened, the occupants of the Peugeot car were dead on target. A source at the Alausa police station to which the Mercedes Benz was later towed said that a bullet went through the driver's side via the front light, indicating that Kudirat's car might have been shot from the front. Having thus stopped the driver, they then shot Kudirat at close range. In the confusion, another account says that the Peugeot car first leveled up with Kudirat's limousine before the assailants shot the driver, and then released a volley of shots at Kudirat's temple. With their fiendish mission accomplished in a matter of seconds, the attackers sped in the direction of Lagos before the police and soldiers at the nearby former toll gate about 150 meters away, raced to the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There, the soldiers and policemen met an almost lifeless Kudirat, a deeply wounded Dauda, and an incoherent Adesian, beckoning on passers-by and motorists to come to the aid of the party. The police reportedly commandeered a Toyota Hiace bus to convey the wounded to the Eko Hospital, less than two kilometers away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In no time, the news of the attack spread like bushfire in harmattan, ricocheting through Lagos. Some witnesses of the bloody event telephoned media houses. One of those so informed was Bayo Onanuga, founding editor-in-chief of TheNews. he rushed to the Abiola household and in fact the first to inform the security men at the gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether Kudirat, the fourth amongst her parent's seven children, would survive the attack became the subject of intense prayers and fervent wishes until later in the evening when Mubasiru, Abiola's younger brother and Kola, his eldest son confirmed the worst: in a space of four years, Abiola has lost his second wife, the first being Simbiat who died in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat's condition when she was wheeled into Theatre Two of the Eko Hospital at about 9:50 a.m. was hopeless. That she stayed alive for about three more hours after she had been shot in the head at such a close range was a minor miracle. A team of surgeons suddenly arrived from around Lagos and other consultants, including some of the hospital's medical directors who were attending a seminar within the hospital's premises battled gallantly to save Kudirat to no avail. At about 1.30 p.m. she breathed her last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dauda, the driver, who was said to have been &quot;seriously wounded&quot; and Adesina, the personal assistant, were luckier. They were said to be responding to treatment by press time. Sources say the driver's case worsened considerably by Wednesday afternoon, but by Friday, the driver who received gunshot wounds in the arm seemed to have passed through the critical stage.  Adesina was apparently not wounded by the gun men although he is believed to have received a waist injury when he hurtled from the car into a ditch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The importance of the life and death of Kudirat came starkly home the following day when her remains were interred at about 5.07 p.m. in the well-manicured lawn overlooking her own duplex in the Abiola compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In what was powerfully evocative of a martyred freedom fighter, virtually every metre of the sprawling compound was cramped by the sea of humanity, ranging from ordinary Nigerians and celebrities to members of the diplomatic corps. The burial rites commenced shortly after two o'clock when students of the Moricass Arabic and Islamic School, Agege, encircled the grave side chanting Islamic songs. Their recitations were almost disrupted by the emotional outburst which greeted the arrival of Mumuni and Mohammadu Hadi, two of the deceased's children in Nigeria. The pair were said to have been spirited out of the Abiola's household to an aunt's place as soon as their mother's death was confirmed. They were informed of the incident only an hour before they were brought into the compound - for the burial ceremony.  The wailing had hardly subsided when the first of four groups of students showed up at the burial. First to arrive were those of the Lagos State University and the Yaba College of Technology. Each group chanted songs casting aspersions on those who cut their heroine down in her prime. Each of the four groups were calmed by Musedik Alogba, president of the United Muslim Council. His mediation efforts paid off until one of the students recognised Abdulwahab Folawiyo, the Baba Adinni of Nigeria, in the section reserved for the Islamic leaders gracing the occasion. The students who perceived Folawiyo as an opponent of the struggle to actualize Abiola's mandate insisted that the millionaire had no business attending Kudirat's burial. He had to be spirited out of the house through the family mosque unto the pedestrian gate by the largely disused upper gate of the compound. His white flowing gown had become stained by the grass and sand hauled at one of the foremost Islamic leaders in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lateef Adegbite, secretary-general of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs almost had a similar treatment. The students had mistaken him apparently for Tele Olukoya, Alogba's predecessor and member of the last constitutional conference. He was spared however when his identity became clearer. Bolstered by their seeming victory, the students soon made for the diplomats' seat where they not only sang but also addressed them, asking for the intervention of the ambassadors' home governments in the unending Nigerian political and economic crises which they said had engendered hunger, insecurity and deprivation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the situation nearly got out of hand, leaders of the National Democratic Coalition led by Bola Ige, Abraham Adesanya, Ayo Adebanjo and Wahab Dosunmu who had arrived about 2.00 p.m. sent Ademola Adeniji-Adele, former chairman of the Lagos Island local government to appeal to the students. The situation thereafter became calm but not before Bala Aiyelabola, one of the student leaders addressed the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By 4.25 p.m. when the Eko Hospital ambulance bearing the white and gold casket arrived the compound, crowd control had become virtually impossible.  With further movement by the hearse absolutely impossible, the coffin was lifted off it and taken to the lawn tennis court where the last prayers were said. If the situation inside the court was rowdy, it was even more so at the graveside to which hundreds of people had laid ambush hours before Kudirat's body arrived. At the praying ground, the casket was not opened contrary to normal Islamic practices, apparently for fear of the body being mangled by the ever surging crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And at the graveside, the officiating ministers had to be extra swift removing the corpse from the casket in conformity with Islamic injunctions which prescribe austere, solemn burial for the faithful. Only the body wrapped in immaculate shroud white material was interred. The empty casket was promptly snatched by the students and other urchins who, carrying it shoulder high, rained abusive songs on the government of Sani Abacha, whom they suspected of masterminding Kudirat's death. They soon emptied into Toyin Street and from there to other major streets of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mob's accusation conforms with one of the views prevalent in the NADECO and other pro-democracy camps since last Tuesday. One of such views linked Kudirat's death with that of Alfred Rewane who was shot in his bedroom, October 6, last year. In retrospect, they now praise the foresight of Anthony Enahor, the septuagenarian politician now in exile in the United States. They claim the elder statesman would have been given the &quot;Rewane treatment&quot; if he had not escaped. This view believes that the federal government is bent on totally annihilating the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet there are those willing to absolve the government. They ascribe the murder of the woman activist to forces opposed to the Abacha regime.  According to this speculation, the killers are out to destabilise the polity, by creating unrest among the populace at home and complicating the government's problems with the foreign powers most of whom had never really forgiven the administration for hanging Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others last November. Perhaps, it is an attempt to proclaim its innocence to the world that the government sent a high-powered delegation led by Isaya Bamaiyi, chief of army staff to the burial. Abacha's condolence message which was delivered to the Abiola family by the delegation was broadcast for two days by the NTA last week, just as Zubair Kazaure appeared on the American cable network to deny government involvement in the death of Abiola's wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police, too, added their own bit. They have so far, left no one in doubt as to their ostensible readiness to fish out Kudirat's killers. In addition to a well broadcast statement asking Nigerians to forward information on the killing to telephone numbers which were repeatedly advertised on network television, a panel headed by Archibong Nkana, deputy inspector- general of police, Federal investigation and Intelligence Bureau, was also put in the works. Lately, it announced a N1 million price tag on any useful information that leads to the arrest of the hoodlums. Nkana personally assured the Abiola family of his panel's resolve to fish out the miscreants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another possibility in NADECO's thinking is that the Kudirat assassination and others before it may have been organized by individuals or groups loyal to the government who chose to act on their own in what they consider to be in the interest of the government. A simple logic is believed to account for this possibility: Security reports have reportedly claimed that there would be no end to the Nigerian crisis if hard-liners like Kudirat were not eliminated. Such self-proclaimed friends of government might not have to be ordered specifically before carrying out their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sheer timing, the killers of Kudirat might just be exploiting the current feud within the Abiola family to throw suspicion all around. To the public, the open disagreements within the family, with Kola on one side and Kudirat on the other, over the legal strategies to adopt to free Abiola might have exposed Kudirat's flanks to the assassins. Already, the Nigerian in the United States is reported to have pointed accusing fingers at some sections of the family as being responsible for Kudirat's death. Such thinking was not lost on Kola himself. A source close to the Abiola's first son said he felt &quot;terribly sad&quot; at the death of his stepmother last week. he reportedly lamented that it was precisely to avoid this kind of calamity befalling his father's house especially now that he is in detention, that he has been advocating a less confrontational approach in the struggle to free his father from the clutches of the ruling military government. He was said to have told relations that his opposition to Kudirat was purely on strategies and that their goals were the same. Lola Edewor, Kola's elder half-sister echoed similar sentiments in an interview with Theweek shortly after Kudirat's interment. She urged people to stop looking for cracks in the family where none had existed and affirmed that the family remained one in the struggle to secure freedom for their detained father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Abiolas grieve over their loss, NADECO leaders seem to have another source of worry: the whereabouts of Adesina. Early reports had it that he was in police custody, ostensibly helping in the investigation of the murder. The group had given the impression that it was desperately in search for the personal assistant to the slain Kudirat as he could be the repository of information and documents vital to the continuation of the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprisingly, the police came out to say they were not holding Adesina and proceeded to question the Abiola family on his whereabouts. The following day, THISDAY reported that Adesina had been arrested in a two-story building opposite the Abiola household thus giving the impression that he had gone into hiding. According to the newspaper, the police took him to Eko Hospital to confirm his story that he had been on admission there. Adesina reportedly denied claims of the pro-democracy activists that none of them had seen him since the fateful Tuesday. The hospital staff seemed to have corroborated Adesina's claim that he had been on admission at Eko Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If anything, the Kudirat killing has further polarised the nation and is capable of escalating the burgeoning political crisis in the nation. A pointer to the divisive chagrin of Nigerians was the manner the various mourning delegations were received at the Abiola compound. When the federal government delegation headed by Bamaiyi the chief of army arrived, it was received with jeers and boos and stony faces. The ten minutes the delegation spent was tension soaked. &quot;What do you want here?&quot; A group chorus to Bamaiyi's entourage. &quot;Just release Abiola to come and mourn his wife. We are no more interested in the presidency.&quot; The anxiety heightened to a point that the army chief had to request from his host if the party could depart through an exit different from the one which it came into the tastefully furnished reception room. Efforts were then made to open an alternative exit, the one used exclusively by Abiola himself. The door would not open apparently because of long period of disuse. The delegation had to brave the odd to out the way they came in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Musa Bamaiyi, brother to leader of the government delegation and boss of the National Law Enforcement Agency came in about two hours later, the federal delegation had departed and the crowd more daring. &quot;What is he writing, one woman asked in Yoruba as Mamaiyi started filling the condolence register. Another wondered aloud why the youth couldn't break through the security cordon around the two-star general to snatch the biro with which he was writing. Unruffled Mamaiyi managed to find his way into Kudirat's living room where he was received by Kudirat Aka- Basorun, wife of one of Abiola's counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A different sort of reception awaited leaders of pro-democracy group considered friendly to Abiola cause. Delegations of such groups as the Campaign for Democracy, and the Civil Liberties Organisation were given triumphed welcome. For the CD, Kudirat's death was a clarion call for &quot;the June 12 struggle to be pursued to its logical conclusion at whatever cost.&quot; Ayo Obe the CLO president said of Kudirat that the &quot;torch of hope which you boldly grasped and which is now so cruelly extinguished will soon be rekindled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the acrimony, nearly all Nigerians were agreed in their effusions of the evil nature of the assassination. Bamaiyi, the NDLEA boss called it &quot;a most disturbing incident and too callous.&quot; To Doyin Okupe, a politician, Kudirat was one of the most steadfast women he had ever met in his 44 years and believes her death will affect the struggle in a great way, &quot;unless we want to kid ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laila Dogonyaro, a woman activist who was reportedly devastated by the news of Kudirat's death described it as a &quot;very sad development.&quot; Her one wish was that government would release Abiola to take control of his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the pro-democracy struggle to which Kudirat dedicated her last moments on earth, it was hardly surprising, that the international community felt outraged. The International Roundtable on Nigeria based in the United States situated the assassination within the context of other attacks on prominent Nigerians in recent times, and condemned them as politically inspired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tow days after the killing, the group offered its &quot;deep sympathies&quot; to Abiola and noted that Kudirat's murder is an unwarranted addition &quot;to the already too-heavy burden of the family.&quot; For the Nigerian Democratic Awareness Committee, headed by Edward Oparaoji a US based Nigerian professor, the Nigerian embassy officials in Washington should stop pointing to the Abiola family as being responsible for the death of their matriarch. More than 40 clergymen and community leaders also met under the aegis of the Religion Action Network at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ, Harlem, New York and noted that the Nigerian regime has stripped the people of their &quot;most basic human and civil rights, replacing them with violence, fear and intolerance.&quot; The conference recalled that many opposition leaders in Nigeria have been unjustly imprisoned, forced into exile or murdered. The clerics called &quot;on all people of goodwill to mark the first Sunday of October this year as the &quot;Nigerian Freedom Sunday, a day of prayer for all victims of oppression and dictatorship&quot; such as Kudirat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a broader level, the United States government called for a thorough investigation of what it regarded as the &quot;apparent assassination&quot; of Kudirat, according to Gly Davies, acting spokesman of the US State department. Noting that the incident occurred shortly after her car had passed a police checkpoint, he called on the Nigerian government to &quot;diligently pursue these killers and ensure that they are brought to book.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British foreign office also reacted, calling for &quot;full investigation&quot; in the murder of Kudirat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In her wildest dreams, Kudirat Olayinka Adeyemi, the pretty one-time head girl of Muslim Girls Secondary School, Ijebu-ode could not have imagined that she would command world attention of this magnitude in death at only 44 years. The big transformation came for her in 1993 when Moshood Abiola whom she married in 1973 declared his interest in that year's presidential election. The widely condemned annulment of that election believed to have been won by her husband roused the latent activist streak in her. And from then on, there was no looking back. She acquired the register of her new found love in the process. Much against the advice of friends, relations and some of her in-laws, Kudirat picked the gauntlet and continued with the struggle when her husband was arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And she would not relent even when danger loomed large, Kudirat Alao Aka-Basorun, her bosom friend testifies to her strength of character: &quot;She was a strong woman. Once she was convinced on an issue, almost always, you can't get her to renege.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such was the driving force that propelled the woman who was born on Tuesday, August 29, 1951 detained overnight for the first and last time in her life on Tuesday may 7, 1996 on account of sedition charges and finally died unbowed on Tuesday June 4, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - Reports from Liberia say at least 15 people a day are dying from food shortages and disease in and around the north-estern town of Tubmanburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tubmanburg has been cut off by nearly two months of bloody factional fighting in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), heading a group of relief organisations including the Catholic Relief Service,has scaled down operations in Liberia following increasing insecurity in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LWF said armed men are preventing the few remaining relief workers from carrying out their duties. Most aid agencies and their staff were evacuated from Monrovia when factional fighting erupted there early April, while a United States naval task force of 2000 marines has been stationed off Liberia ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press release issued from the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, following a meeting of 12 non- governmental organisations (NGOs) on May 28, more than 400 vehicles belonging to aid agencies including the United Nations, were looted during the recent fighting. The statement put the value of the vehicles, other equipment and resources at US$ 35 million since early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement issued by the LWF said the NGOs' action is due to the repeated abuse of humanitarian principles and materials. The statement quoted the NGOs as saying it is time to break a cycle of broken promises and stop contributing to the profits of the warring factions and fueling the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agencies, drawn from both church and secular organisations, said they would provide only &quot;targeted minimal life-saving interventions&quot; in order not to unwillingly prolong the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said their decision to limit emergency response, taken late May, would be communicated to the people of Liberia, the warlords, and to the wider international community including the US government, the European Union, the UN and its agencies, the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG and the governments of the Economic community of West African states (ECOWAS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a senior US official has accused troops from the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, of being involved in the looting. The official said recently the troops &quot;are heavily involved, and have been involved since the day they arrived, in ripping off Liberians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;West African governments ought to police ECOMOG better,&quot; he is quoted as saying adding that Nigerian members of the peacekeeping force were particularly at fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official's statement came after State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said recently that Liberian looting &quot;has reached outrageous heights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burns said the United States was asking West African countries to cooperate in the inspection of ships in their ports which they have reason to believe are transporting stolen goods and to facilitate the return of looted property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Monrovia has been emptied,&quot; Burns told reporters, adding that the rival factions vying for control of the country were not the only culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State Department spokesman went on to say that three recent ships were responsible for looting &quot;large quantities of goods&quot; in Monrovia from the United Nations, NGOs and private businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burns further alleged that the Bulk Challenge, after receiving permission to disembark more than 1000 passengers in Ghana, departed for Nigeria with looted property still in its hold. The ship had spent 10 days at sea with the refugees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - A supreme court judge has cautioned Ugandan men against interfering with the democratic rights of their wives or in any way discriminating against them for exercising their right to vote for candidates of individual choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Husbands keep off your hands from your wives and let them enjoy and exercise their newly recognised freedoms,&quot; Supreme Court judge Justice Benjamin Odoki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to reports that a number of women had been battered throughout the country in the aftermath of the recently concluded presidential polls, the judge said it was a criminal offence for husbands to beat their wives for voting candidates of their choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Odoki who was officiating at the launching of Guidebook on Domestic Violence early June said that wife battering, assault or any other form of discrimination against women was prohibited by Uganda's new Constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to press and other reports, a number of women were beaten and invariably intimidated for supporting, actually voting for or celebrating the victory of a candidate their husbands did not favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one incident, Jesca Kasiri of Nawandyo in Iganga district, Eastern Uganda, was allegedly beaten into a coma by her husband, Peter Kolwa, after she revealed to him she had voted for Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mukono district, a middle-aged Karim Lubega of Kikuba Nkima village, is suspected to have beaten his wife, Rose Namubiru, 40, to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a different but related case, a bicycle mechanic in Arua town staked his wife against another man's Uganda Shillings 100,000 (US$1000) over the outcome of the presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These developments prompted the Alert Group for the Uganda Women's Network (UWN) to petition President Museveni and the Chairman of the Interim Electoral Commission (IEC) to intervene and put a stop to the &quot;intimidation and harassment of wives by their husbands&quot; and to treat any such violence as &quot;serious crime&quot; and not &quot;domestic dispute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group further asked the government and the IEC to tell all Ugandans that women's rights are human rights and to re-emphasize the fact that women have rights as citizens of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women also demanded reassurance that the Government will protect them and their property during and after elections. The group said that police should always be called in where there is intimidation, harassment and violence against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Justice Odoki: &quot;Such acts are criminal, unconstitutional, degrading and unacceptable in a free and democratic society like ours. Women have equal democratic rights with men and do not have to consult their husbands on whom to vote for in a public election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitution also prohibits cultures or traditions which are against the dignity, welfare or interest of women or which undermine their status, Justice Odoki said, adding, &quot;the battered women's syndrome could lead to despair and hopelessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that though emphasis has been traditionally placed on physical abuse, there was a need to pay more attention to the psychological consequences of domestic violence as one way of averting such despair and hopelessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guidebook was written by the National Association of Women Judges (NAWJ) as a follow-up to a meeting of the International Association of Women Judges (JAWJ). Held in 1992 in San Diego, United States, the meeting among other highlights resolved to treat domestic violence as a major issue that requires investigation and public awareness in each individual member country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NAWJ was formed in 1994 and has since provided counselling services to spouses, both men and women, and helped in sensitising the general public on gender issues. Next August, the NAWJ will host a regional conference for Africa on domestic violence, marriage and property rights, Justice Mukasa Kikonyogo, a spokesperson of the association said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It now remains to be seen whether men will heed Justice Odoki's caution during the forthcoming parliamentary elections for the 214 &quot;normal constituency seats&quot; scheduled for June 27. These will be followed by local authorities elections at a date yet to be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of many attempts to address one aspect of gender imbalance, the new constitution provides for 39 additional elective district seats specifically for women - one for each of the country's 39 districts. These will be elected on June 20, six days ahead of the normal constituency polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are 86 women candidates for the 39 district seats while a total of 26 women will contest in 24 of the 214 normal constituencies in straight fights with male contestants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In her address, Justice Mukasa Kikonyogo thanked the Government for its continued policy to correct the gender imbalance in the Ugandan society, which she said was largely responsible for domestic violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Eight members of former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP), including its vice president, were charged with treason on June 4 over a string of bombings, a charge which is punishable by death in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have been accused of forming a group calling itself Black Mamba, which has claimed responsibility for recent bomb attacks in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The previously unknown group surfaced in response to a new constitutional amendment which effectively barred Kaunda from running for re-election later this year because his parents were not born in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP vice president Inyambo Yeta, former Finance Minister Rabson Chongo and Kaunda aide Muhabi Lungu appeared with five others -- including three former army officers -- in the Lusaka magistrates court in connection with four counts of treason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda defied a heavy police presence to address a crowd of about 700 UNIP supporters outside the court, accusing President Frederick Chiluba's Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) government of trying to create a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are dealing with little frightened criminals,&quot; the former president said, claiming that the government was trying to block an opposition rally scheduled for the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight men have been accused of involvement in a bomb blast which damaged a wall at State House two weeks ago, planting a bomb at the Intercontinental Hotel in Lusaka and the bombing of the government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper offices in the town of Ndola the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were all arrested on June 2 and 3 and UNIP officials said they expected more of their members to be picked up in the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight UNIP members were not asked to plead and were remanded in custody until a High Court hearing, expected later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from threatening to plunge the country into an unprecedented political uncertainty, the controversial new constitutional amendment already signed into law by the Zambian parliament, has also been attracting unfavourable international attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 2, the United States also threatened to review its Zambian aid programmes following the controversial constitutional amendment, a US State Department communique released by the US embassy in the Zambian capital said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the light of the government of Zambia's action, the United States is reviewing its bilateral relationship, including assistance programmes in Zambia,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US aid includes some 20 million dollars for health matters and legislative reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba recently signed into law the amendment which stipulates that presidential candidates' parents must have been born in Zambia, and effectively barred Kaunda from running in the elections later this year because his parents came from Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, who heads the opposition UNIP, has vowed to break the law if he is not allowed to stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US statement said that the United States deplored the constitutional amendment, which it said limits Zambians' right to choose their president freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added that the amendment was a serious threat to the integrity and credibility of the electoral process and significantly undermined Zambia's democratic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States said it had repeatedly expressed concern over the amendments to the Zambian constitution, and called on Zambia to reverse the changes and take steps to ensure the elections were free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Minister Ronald Penza, quoted by the state-owned Sunday Times of Zambia, criticised the US action, saying it would influence decisions by other donor nations, although he said US aid was insignificant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was unfair of the United States to dictate the pace of democratisation in Zambia, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sacked the government on June 3 in an effort to rescue the country's collapsing economy, and named the respected parliamentary speaker Fernando Van Dunem as the new prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central Bank governor Antonio Gomes Furtado was also dismissed and Dos Santos suspended the currency exchange market, saying that all &quot;strategic&quot; banking operations now had to be authorised by the president alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The system of production is paralysed and the social situation has worsened,&quot; Dos Santos said in a message to the nation that clearly blamed sacked Prime Minister Marcolino Moco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The health and education services have collapsed. It is time to change things and those who have made mistakes must assume the responsibility,&quot; Dos Santos said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying that formerly Marxist Angola must advance step by step to a market economy, the president set as targets the revival of production reduced to nothing -- apart from the oil industry -- by 20 years of civil war, the repair of basic infrastructure and reform of the banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said there must be a single rate of exchange for the national currency, the kwanza, which is officially worth 55,000 to the US dollar but on the black market fetches 240,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the aims are hardly different from those set out in the Economic and Social Plan drawn up in April last year, which the Moco government had totally failed to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos pledged to introduce a realistic wage policy -- the minimum wage is about six US dollars a month -- as well as fight corruption, embezzlement and illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also made a small but important gesture to Jonas Savimbi, leader of the formerly rebel Union for the Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement, by promising to put into effect an amnesty law approved last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi had demanded a solemn proclamation of the amnesty, pardoning those who had taken up arms again over the past five years following a peace accord which failed to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end of the civil war with the Lusaka accords of November 1994 has failed to improve the standard of living of Angola's citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda, with its three million inhabitants, is overpopulated and dilapidated, with open sewers, crumbling streets and virtually no electric power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crime is rife, often involving the police and the army, poverty absolute, and tension high in the shanty suburbs, where police pounce on any sign of revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A German Catholic priest, Konrad Liebscher, was arrested last month for alleged offences against state security after calling on the government to raise wages, before being freed on June 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general of the ruling People's Liberation Movement (MPLA), Lopo do Nascimento, warned in an interview with the Portuguese weekly Visao last week of a military coup if things did not improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new premier, Van Dunem, 61, is a lawyer by training, becoming a career diplomat in 1973 with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which he represented at the United Nations in Geneva from 1978-79.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1979 and 1982 he was Angola's ambassador to Belgium, the Netherlands and the European Community before becoming ambassador to Portugal, the former colonial power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1985 he was named Deputy Foreign minister, then Justice minister and Planning minister before becoming Speaker of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Dunem has been given up to five days to form a new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the UN Security Council on May 8 renewed the mandate of the UN force in Angola for two months, but warned that the lack of cooperation by UNITA rebels could bring about the &quot;collapse&quot; of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In resolution 1055 adopted unanimously, the Security Council renewed the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III) until July 11, but expressed &quot;profound regret&quot; at the slow pace of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the disarmament operation began at the end of November under the peace accord, only 32,800 of the 63,000 UNITA troops have gone to the UN-supervised camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The fifth pan-African Children's Book Fair (PACBF) which opened its doors to the public on May 28 at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) here, ended on May 31, with most participants describing it as successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing participants during PACBF's closing ceremony, Mrs Elizabeth Masiga, the Chief Inspector of (Kenyan) Schools, commended both local and external publishers for &quot;the efforts you put in this exercise to make it a success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Masiga went on to say that the event &quot;is a significant development for our children as it will enhance and nurture the development of a reading habit among children at an early age.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-day fair which attracted more than 1,000 participants, was organised by the Nairobi-based Council for the Promotion of Children's Science Publications in Africa (CHISCI), with assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 19 countries, 12 of which came from Africa were represented at this year's fair. These among others include Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Others were France, Germany, and Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pan-African Children's Book Fair is said to be &quot;the only full fledged regular book fair of international stature in the East and Central African region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various activities took place at the children's fair. One such event was UNESCO's launching of the Science for Africa Project (SAP). The launching of SAP, an activity of the Cultural Division of UNESCO, took the form of a one-and-a-half day seminar addressed by a number of experts from Japan, the Philippines, India and Colombia. The project is meant to encourage science writing of children's books by African authors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another highlight was a unique seminar duped &quot;Libraries Alive&quot;, meant mainly for teachers, parents and librarians. Its purpose was to &quot;develop strategies of making libraries attractive to children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of papers and case studies were presented by experts who work in this field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also featured was a children's reading tent. The children's reading tent gave children an opportunity to see all the books exhibited from Africa and the rest of the world as well as a chance to read as many as they could. The reading tent was visibly a favourite among children's activities, especially because of the dramatized story telling which went on in the tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing participants during the closing ceremony, Mrs Masiga noted that the most important African resource is the human resource of which children make about a half. She noted that &quot;children are a rich reservoir of skills and talents which we must start tapping now by giving children the ability to understand the environment around them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other activities which took place during the fair include a read-to- the-children-competition, a children's environment debate and a fun-with-science workshop which ran throughout the fair to exemplify its theme: Learning Science at an Early Age.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arusha, Tanzania - The first two Rwandans to appear before the UN tribunal trying suspects alleged to have carried out the 1994 ethnic genocide in Rwanda were formally charged here on May 30 and immediately pleaded not guilty to a total of 20 charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former militia leader George Rutaganda, 37, and former municipal leader Jean-Paul Akayesu, 43, appeared before the court in this northern Tanzanian town before their trials were adjourned until September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the May 30 hearings, which lasted less than 45 minutes each, an assistant to the court clerk read out eight charges against Rutaganda and 12 against Akayesu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charges, read in French, included genocide, crimes against humanity and murder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rutaganda, who arrived amid tight security and was escorted by two police officers at the preliminary court set up in a room in the International Conference Centre in Arusha, from time to time smiled tensely, but showed little emotion as the charges were read to him, only shaking his head as he was accused of ordering Hutu militia to &quot;throw the Tutsis in the river.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former businessman, Rutaganda was second vice-president of the national committee of the Interahamwe -- literally &quot;youth section&quot; - which later became the feared Hutu militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is accused of distributing arms to Hutu militiamen who allegedly used them to massacre men, women and children sheltered in a school near the Rwandan capital, Kigali. Rutaganda is further accused of ordering them to kill Tutsis and of himself taking part in the killings in various places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Interahamwe, who were often armed with machetes, lances or cudgels, are accused of the worst atrocities during the 1994 genocide which left at least 500,000 dead among the Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court clerk Andronico Adede suggested the proper trial should begin in mid-August, but defence lawyer Luc de Temmerman told the court that would not give him sufficient time to prepare his defence, and asked for a visa for Rwanda, so that he can collect witness reports and &quot;examine the scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akayesu, who was mayor of Taba in the Gitarama district of central Rwanda, also appeared calm during the hearing and sat straight in his chair and took notes as he listened to the charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is accused of having incited genocide and of participating in murders and interrogation sessions that ended in torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third suspect Clement Kayishema, the former local government chief in Kibuye south-western Rwanda where the massacre of minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates was particularly ferocious and systematic, also appeared before the tribunal on May 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecution at the UN war crimes tribunal here said Clement Kayishema, a doctor by profession, had led a systematic campaign of genocide by allowing the massacre of people who had taken refuge in a church and sports stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema, 42, was the government's top representative in the Kibuye region of south-west Rwanda. It had one of the highest percentages of minority Tutsis of any region in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema did not appear troubled as the damning charges were read out to him, and grinned when the court clerk spoke of him firing the shot at the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by Judge Laity Kama after each charge whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty, he repeated 25 times in a confident voice: &quot;I plead not guilty, your honour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were 252,000 Tutsis in Kibuye before the 1994 civil war, but less than 8,000 afterwards, according to the human rights group, Africa Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another key Rwandan suspect, Colonel Theoneste Bagosara, who is accused of being one of the leading figures in the country's campaign of ethnic slaughter is expected to be moved soon from his Cameroon prison to await trial before the UN war crimes tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonel Bagosara would be transferred within two weeks to the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, where the tribunal is being held, his Belgian lawyer Luc de Temmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least another three Rwandans imprisoned in Cameroon, including Ferdinand Nahimana, one of the founders of the infamous Thousand Hills Radio, - Radio Milles Collines, would also be transferred with Colonel Bagosara to Arusha.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Rev. Njongonkulu Winston Ndungane, the Bishop of Kimberly and Kuruman in the Northern Cape, was elected late on June 4 as the new Archbishop of Cape Town to succeed retiring Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Tutu, 64, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, retires as head of the Anglican Church in Southern Africa next September, although he plans to take his sabbatical leave from church duties from the end of June, only three months away from his 65th birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will continue to serve as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the panel created to probe human rights abuses of South Africa's apartheid era. He is also President of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu was one of the most vocal critics of the former National Party regime's policies of racial separation and was the first black man to head the church, before winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndungane, 55 is the son of an Anglican priest who studied at King's College, London and served as assistant priest in several London parishes before returning to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He became Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman four-and-a-half years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before last week's elective assembly in Bishop's School in Rondebosch, Rev. Njongonkulu Ndungane and Bishop Duncan Buchanan had been proposed as the two candidates for the position of Archbishop of Cape Town and Head of the Province of Southern Africa. Bishop Buchanan is serving in Johannesburg, where Tutu also served as bishop before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church's elective assembly is made up of the three houses of bishops, clergy and laity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides South Africa, the church province includes Lesotho, Namibia,and St. Helena, Niassa and Lebombo in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the week on June 2, Archbishop Desmond Tutu gave a farewell communion service in a huge undercover sports arena here. Packed into the Good Hope Centre to say goodbye to the archbishop were 10,000 congregants, many of whom had been brought in with fleets of buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two thousand choristers led the singing of hymns and psalms in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa, along with an organ, a group of instrumentalists and a marimba band, playing drums and the African xylophone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the centre reached its capacity, officials closed the doors, leaving several hundred would-be communicants pressing angrily against the glass outside. A number of unChristian remarks were passed, but eventually everyone was accommodated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of dancers performed a &quot;liturgical dance&quot; to the tune &quot;Africa is the place of the beating drum,&quot; and a lone ballerina in gypsy costume also danced &quot;God Bless Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Tutu praised God for His sense of humour in making a small man with a flat nose archbishop, and giving him a name which lent itself to graffiti. He cited one example: &quot;I was a Christian, until I put two and two together.&quot; And then mentioned a pop song, one line of which ran: &quot;Don't mess with my tutu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The archbishop also praised what he called God's sense of timing in allowing him to say farewell soon after South Africa became a fully democratic country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were those who were against apartheid. We were in the 'against mode'. Now we have to show much more clearly what we are for. We must change from the 'against mode' into the 'for mode',&quot; he said. &quot;So clearly we need a fresh, a vigorous and certainly a much younger leadership. A leader with a new vision for our church, which has sometimes appeared to be directionless,&quot; the archbishop said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What better time, he asked, to say: &quot;Bye-bye Tutu&quot;?  Tributes were paid to the archbishop and to his wife, Leah, by representatives of the province, by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cape Town, Lawrence Henry, and presents were given by dioceses from around the province, including the sees of Namibia, Lesotho and Niassa and Lebombo in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Istanbul - As 25,000 delegates from government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious groups, women, youth groups and private sector converge in Istanbul, Turkey from June 3 to 14 to discuss human settlement, poverty, population and the environment, sub-Saharan Africa still disturbingly bears the brunt of these amongst many other woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite advances made in human welfare and technology, there is today a growing polarization between rich and poor and a failure of political will to address the silent but nevertheless threatening emergence of those who cannot make ends meet, millions of whom are concentrated is sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this region, poverty is said to be on the increase. On the UN list of the 52 poorest countries in the world, 32 are in sub- Saharan Africa, while 75 per cent of the zone's population of over 500 million people earn less than one US dollar a day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human settlements scenario is said to be appalling, more so in fast growing urban centres. Some sub-Saharan African urban populations are growing at an alarming rate. Zimbabwe's urban population was expected to grow from 1.2 million in 1975 to 4.5 million by the year 2000 and to peak to 20.2 million by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Centre for Human Settlement (UNCHS), Habitat, Global Report on Human Settlements, Statistical Annex, (Draft) 1995 further shows that Nigeria which had an urban population of 14.6 million people in 1975 is expected to be home to some 146.9 million by 2025. Sudan which had an urban population of 3 million people will have to house, feed, transport and employ 27 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The population of most sub-Saharan African towns is growing at an average of over 5 per cent per annum. Ethiopia's population, for instance, is said to be growing at 5.53 per cent and Malawi's at 5.88 per cent. The continent's urban population, estimated at 104 million in 1975 is expected to swell up to 804.2 million by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Often, immigrants in search of better living standards or in flight from conflicts swell up African towns and cities whose infrastructures are static.  This leads to acute overcrowding, the straining of such facilities as water, electricity, means of transport and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also leads to environmental degradation which HABITAT II, also referred to as The City Summit is poised to discuss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task ahead of HABITAT II is ardous and unenviable. What makes the work of the UN body even more difficult is lack of a positive track record of the hosts which could help salvage its image and imbue in sub-Saharan African people trust that this time round, the international forum will come up with viable and sustainable resolutions for their region's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HABITAT II, whose two themes are Adequate shelter for all and Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world was preceded by HABITAT I in 1976, in Vancouver, Canada. But it appears the meeting came out with resolutions which seem to have been swept under the carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the Vancouver summit, the problem of human shelter has deteriorated even further. A United Nations report ahead of the Istanbul conference said that about 100 million people worldwide, mostly women, are today homeless and up to 600 million are poorly and unhealthly housed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matters have become worse for sub-Saharan Africa. A 1992 World Bank study reports that 220 million people south of the Sahara live in absolute poverty. It adds that 18 of the world's 20 poorest countries are in this region and that due to war, drought, famine and desertification, food production has dropped to a level 20 per cent below the 1970 level while the population has trebled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skeptics wonder whether this time the HABITAT II meeting will reverse this woeful trend. Many issues are poised to be points of discussion at the Istanbul summit. In fact the Istanbul agenda is said to be so expansive that the summit appears to be attempting to solve all of humanity's problems in one sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the HABITAT Agenda, the Istanbul summit will discuss and make recommendations in relation to &quot;the right to adequate housing, which includes access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services,&quot; which the UN publication cites as essential to a person's physical, psychological, social and economic well being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will also discuss &quot;sustainable development of human settlements which combines economic development, social development and environmental protection, with the full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms; including the right to development, and offers means of achieving a world of greater stability and peace, built on ethical and spiritual vision.&quot; How and whether this can be achieved in the near future remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Running up to the Istanbul meeting have been a chain of other international conferences which, among other issues, aimed to alleviate the suffering of the poor. From The Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000, adopted in 1988 through the 1989 World Conference on Education for All to the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in 1995, little has been said of the gains made by the poor of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, the situation has continued to worsen instead of improving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development duped the Earth Summit, which was held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 and where Agenda 21 was produced, &quot;the international communities agreed on a framework for the sustainable development of human settlements&quot; according to the HABITAT Agenda. How much sub-Saharan African has benefited is still not clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this conference, the United States of America reportedly pledged to donate US dollars 125 million towards environmental protection. The Third World, on the other hand, was asked to raise a further 500 million dollars towards the same project. Today, little is known of these noble proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say that all these conferences &quot;have begun to deliver a more holistic, informed and humane message about our global problems and about the cooperative and creative solutions they require.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So be it. However, the Istanbul meeting should aim to translate &quot;the messages about our global problems&quot; into action to solve these real problems, more so in regard to the world's most impoverished region -- the sub-Saharan region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Secretary-General of Habitat II, Dr. Wally N'Dow put it, &quot;Habitat II is more than a conference. It is a recognition...an awakening...that time is running out; that if we want to save the future we have no choice other than to find answers today...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting Juma Assiago, of youth for HABITAT II (Kenya), one may ask; &quot;Will the coming conference be a real step forward in building a different and better sub-Saharan Africa?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Former Ugandan Head of State General Tito Okello Lutwa died at Nsambya Hospital here on June 5. He was 85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was first admitted to Nsambya in sub-urban Kampala last February, complaining of heart problems. He was flown to West Germany for specialised treatment in late March. Upon his recovery he stayed with his sons in London only to relapse again when he returned to Kampala in May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tito Okello became Uganda's Head of State in 1985 after staging a coup against former President Milton Obote whose constant preoccupation with intrigues, General Okello simply detested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was passed over for promotion as Commander of the Uganda Army in the mid-sixties because Obote was aware that General Okello was against the violent uprooting of the kingdoms ordered by Obote in 1966. Obote appointed Colonel Idi Amin to be his commander, bypassing Okello who was senior to Amin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the overthrow of Milton Obote in 1985, General Tito Okello's short lived military junta attempted to negotiate peace with Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA), whose guerrillas had reached the outskirts of Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya agreed to broker peace between the Ugandan combatants in Nairobi, but Museveni changed his mind after the Nairobi accord. His victorious forces entered Kampala in January 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okello went into exile in Dar es Salaam until 1992 when he took advantage of a general amnesty extended to him and others by President Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government built him a mansion and offered the general generous retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until his death, he was advisor to Museveni on the North, particularly on Acholi issues. It is General Okello who advised Museveni not to launch an all out offensive against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony but instead to use the carrot- approach simultaneously, so as to gradually win over the North including Lango district, former President Milton Obote's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Museveni was the first to send messages of condolence to the family and relatives of General Okello who would be accorded full military honours during his burial scheduled for June 7 in his Kitgum district in the North.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lisbon - Members of the family of the late United States President John Kennedy are expected to travel to Luanda soon to discuss the setting up of a Catholic University in Angola, as well as other aid projects, the Portuguese daily Journal de Noticias reported here on May 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting the US Consul in Luanda Daniel Chase, the daily said the Citizen Energy Corporation, headed by Michael Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of the assassinated president, was in contact with the Angolan government and the Catholic church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 17-member mission was expected in Luanda on May 30 to hold talks with Angola's ministers for Oil, Agriculture and Communications and Transport, as well as with the country's Roman Catholic Archbishop Alexandre do Nascimento, the report said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The establishment of the university would be one of the few major projects the Catholic church intends to establish in the war-torn former Portuguese colony once the ongoing peace process is realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last December, the Catholic bishop of Lubango, Monsignor Manuel Franklin da Costa, announced here during a visit to Portugal that the Catholic church in Angola was preparing to relaunch a radio station, and possibly a newspaper, 20 years after Angola's independence from Portuguese rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monsignor Da Costa said then that Radio Ecclesia would resume broadcasts from January, starting around the capital city, Luanda, with coverage to extend across the war-ravaged nation from March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very important that Radio Ecclesia go on air and provide news with total impartiality ... to help Angolans draw their own conclusions on what is happening in the country,&quot; the bishop stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before 1975, when Angola was still a Portuguese colony, the radio used to operate 24 hours a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop also announced then that another fixture of colonial times, the Apostolado newspaper, may also reappear in March, but it would be a monthly, and not a daily as before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are now rebuilding everything that was destroyed in the war,&quot; the bishop said, referring to the civil war between the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope to be able to do this because it is important for the Angolan people,&quot; Monsignor Da Costa stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop's revelations came amidst mounting fears in Angola that the ceasefire between the warring factions was collapsing as a result of suspicious and conflicting reports on the situation in the country, which would have called the UN-brokered peace into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it is not clear whether both the church radio station and newspaper are operational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - The World Council of Churches (WCC) intends to raise US dollars 8 million for emergency and other related refugee activities in Africa this year, the organisation's Executive Secretary for Migration, Patrick Taran, has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with APS onJune 6, the WCC official said the amount will be &quot;outside the normal WCC budget for its refugee activities on the continent, which runs at US$ 2 million, annually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We also intend to raise another US$ 3 million for the WCC sponsored refugee activities in the Sudan,&quot; Taran further said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC Secretary for Migration was briefing APS on the organisation's contribution at the May 30 to 31 international conference here, on the problems of refugees and other displaced persons in the former Soviet Union countries, referred to as Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This was the first time that (the Geneva-based) WCC joined other church-related bodies to make its stand on a vital issue such as the problem of refugees and other displaced persons,&quot; said Taran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other bodies that joined the WCC in making the statement for the conference included the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), International Catholic Migration Commission, Hungarian Interchurch Aid, Caritas Internationalis, the World Young Women's Christian Association and the Conference of European Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We strongly support the emphasis given to prevention of involuntary human displacement...We urge that particular attention be given to the special needs of uprooted women and children in the implementation of the programme of action,&quot; said the WCC statement, signed by Taran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international conference, which brought together more than 60 countries represented by governmental, non-governmental organisations and church-related delegates such as the WCC, was organised jointly by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Organizations for Migration and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Africa, participants represented Kenya, Zambia, Angola, Morocco, Algeria, South Africa and Madagascar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WCC statement, some 9 million people have been displaced in the CIS countries since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Geneva conference was the first full-scale effort by international organisations, the CIS countries and other states to formulate a concerted plan of action for dealing with movements of people described by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata as &quot;of astounding scale and complexity,&quot; said the WCC statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that humanitarian, pastoral and legal action taken by Christians and church-related organisations to attend to refugees, displaced, migrants and uprooted people has often preceded action by governments and inter-governmental agencies, the statement noted that the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, saw church-related organizations become increasingly concerned with the population movements within and to the republics of CIS and neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Geneva meeting also highlighted the commitment by international Christian organisations to continue supporting uprooted people in the CIS region through programmes for training social workers, personnel exchanges, provision of material assistance and other activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC and its related church bodies welcomed the CIS conference and &quot;the efforts to elaborate common principles, policy and operational framework for the entire region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The migration phenomenon must be identified as distinct from such issues as drugs, crime and terrorism; these exist and must be combated irrespective of migration, the WCC statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is home to an estimated 6 million refugees out of the world total of 16 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of the estimated 30 million internally displaced persons worldwide, 50 per cent are said to be in African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the south-western city of Ibadan on June 5 to protest the assassination of Kudiratu Abiola, the senior wife of jailed Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Abiola, 44, died on June 4 in Eko Hospital, a private clinic in Ikeja in the north of Lagos near where she lived, shortly after unknown gunmen opened fire on her car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to witnesses, five people in a car opened fire on her Mercedes as she was on her way to a meeting with a senior Western diplomat in Victoria, a residential area of the capital, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protestors, mostly students, chanted slogans critical of the military regime and demanded the release of Moshood Abiola and acceptance of the June 1993 presidential election results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola has been in detention on treason charges since June 1994 for declaring himself president on the first anniversary of the election which he claimed to have won, but which was annulled by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protest march started from Ibadan University and headed towards the headquarters of the Oyo state military governor, Colonel Ike Nwosu but although there were no signs of trouble, police intervened and broke up the march, making several arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibadan, a major city in south-western Nigeria is only a few kilometres from the town of Abeokuta where the late Kudiratu was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All was said to be calm also in Lagos where Kudiratu Abiola was to be buried later in the day, with many representatives of the diplomatic corps in Nigeria attending the burial ceremony, diplomatic sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Abiola's violent death sent shock waves across the country, sparking a wave of condemnations at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The senior wife of the Muslim opposition leader and millionaire newspaper tycoon was also one of the main figures of the Nigerian opposition group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Married to Chief Abiola in 1973, she was said to be his favourite wife among the 15 or so he is reputed to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since her husband's imprisonment, Abiola's wife and sons had been looking after his business interests, including the national daily newspaper Concord headed by another wife, Doyin Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of her husband's most ardent defenders during the past few years, Kudiratu Abiola fought for his cause, publicly calling for recognition that he won the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month Kudiratu Abiola and two printers had appeared in court charged with conspiracy and making false statements. They pleaded not guilty and her trial was due to start on July 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her family said in a statement signed by eldest son Kola Abiola that &quot;the way and manner of her death is to say the least bizarre and shocking.  The family implores the authorities to do everything within their powers to bring the culprits to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition umbrella Campaign for Democracy group said in a communique that &quot;we do not have to look too far for her assassins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said her struggle to get her husband released had set her on a collision course with the military government, and called for an independent commission to investigate the attack and &quot;bring her killers to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the only way we can resist the temptation to conclude that she was assassinated by the military junta which has illegally held her husband captive for two years now,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charges apparently arose from interviews she gave to Nigerian and foreign media in which she called for her husband's release from prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian police chief said in a statement they had &quot;directed a full-scale investigation&quot; into Abiola's assassination and pledged that&quot;no stone will be left unturned in unravelling the perpetrators of this heinous crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first reactions from outside Nigeria was that of South African President Nelson Mandela, who expressed shock and disbelief at what had happened in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar reactions were registered from Washington, London and Paris, with the respective authorities calling on the Nigerian government to ensure that the killers of Kudiratu Abiola were brought to book.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The Delegation of the European Commission has announced that over the next five years the indicative volume of resources on which programming can be based will be 370 million dollars (294 million ECU) consisting entirely of grants. This was announced by the Charge d' Affairs, Mr. Henry Prankered, during his meeting with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi on May 22.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press release obtained from the European Union Delegation of the European Commission to Ethiopia, another miles tone in relations between Ethiopia and the European commission is reached with the announcement of the signing of the agreement revising the IV LOME Convention in Mauritius in November 1995. This convention will govern the use of the grant funds of 370 million dollars for Ethiopia up to the year 2,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increase in resources, from 214 MECU for the period 1990- 1995, bears concerted witness to the European Commission's desire to maintain the privileged relationship with Ethiopia and contrasts with the general contraction of both bilateral and multilateral aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is anticipated that there will be a programming mission to visit Ethiopia to discuss the use of these funds which will be made available in two branches of 70% and 30%. In addition to the above grant funds there are also funds available to Ethiopia through the Regional Indicative Program as well as through additional financing instruments such as food Aid, Social Rehabilitation Program, STABEX and to support institutional and administrative reforms. Furthermore loan funds are available through the European Investment Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days after celebrating Europe Day (May 9), the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Delegation in Ethiopia, the Charge d'Affaires handed over a note from Prof. Pinheiro, Commissioner for External Relations to ACP states, to the Prime Minister indicating the volume of resources which can be expected in the framework of the Lome Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foundation of the Lome Convention, which links 70 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific to the European Union, was laid in the Treaty of Rome. In 1975 the European Community signed the first Lome Convention: During the past twenty years, the Lome convention has provided African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states with a partnership characterised by security and reliability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Officials from the Investment Office of Ethiopia yesterday discussed with representatives of the business community and members of the House of People's Representatives standing committee for economic affairs the amended investment proclamation of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new Investment Proclamation is a completely revised and expanded form of the original investment decree 15/84 which was considered as vague, not explicit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining the rational behind introducing the new proclamation, the head of the Investment Office of Ethiopia, Ato Tadesse Haile, said that the previous version was prepared hastily and thus had many weaknesses which created problems in its implementation. The new Investment Proclamation No .  . ./96, he said, was a revised and expanded version and is intended to better serve the interests of the society and encourage investors in particular.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ato Tadesse, the drafting of this proclamation involved serious and extensive research and study and valuable lessons had been drawn from problems encountered in the implementation process of the previous proclamation 15/84 as well as the fruitful experiences of foreign countries, especially those of South East Asia and Africa as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nothing that the new Investment Proclamation will help in the successful execution of the government's five-year plan of peace democracy and development, Ato Tadesse said that it has a great deal of incentive to offer and guarantees aspiring investors, both foreign and domestic, firm security.  He said such details have been clearly and distinctly included, adding this is a marked departure from the Proclamation 15/84 which was &quot;not transparent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new proclamation includes various basic sectors in the production and social areas like education and health, which were not included in the previous Proclamation 15/84 that focused on &quot;limited sectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the occasion, representatives of the business community posed several questions and reservations on the new proclamation, including on such sectors as minimum capital requirement for foreign investors, which they said should be lowered to 200,000 dollars from 300,000 dollars stipulated by the new proclamation. Ato Tadesse said that this was not a worrying matter as most applications from foreign investors up to now have not complained, adding that the minimum capitals presented were even many times bigger than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also demanded that such general expressions as &quot;other relevant information&quot; found in several articles of the new proclamation be avoided as they are &quot;highly subjective&quot; and create favourable conditions for bureaucratic redtape. They also requested that such activities dealing with those incentives to be given to investors and on ways of land allocation be listed clearly and in detail. They also recommended that at least one, representative from the private sector be given membership of the investment board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law stipulates that the credit institutions would be share companies to be set up only by Ethiopians and could provide loans either in cash or kind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The licensing and monitoring credit institutions law was necessitated out of the need to incorporate small credit service into the country's fiscal and financial policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A study carried out by the National Bank of Ethiopia and submitted to the house indicated that state and private banks at present serve mostly the business community in major towns and as a result people in the low income groups are suffering at the hands of usurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An expert from the National Bank said small scale business credit agencies differ from big banks in that their credit amount is decided by the bank and mostly they operate while making losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The house has also looked into a bill amending the code establishing the federal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a three-day legal workshop organised for members of parliament was opened by House Speaker Dawit Yohannes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The house, he said, has the responsibility of legislating and following up the proper interpretation of laws as of gathering public opinion and seeking ways for a joint development endeavours. In this regard, the workshop would greatly help MPs to discharge their duties properly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Ghanaian authorities are getting increasingly worried over what they deem to be the local media's destructive agenda to derail the gains being made in this West African nation's investment drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their concern stems from what they deem as an orchestrated attempt by the media, particularly the independent press, to stifle investment initiatives taken by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is because the image being projected does not reflect the truth and only goes to reinforce a perception, which we are constantly bemoaning,&quot; says Kwesi Ahwoi, Chief Executive of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre, a government body charged with investment promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Otherwise why should a section of our media scream 'coup d'etat' in banner headlines when they know very well that they do not want one to occur - you know investors do not put their monies in coup prone areas,&quot; stresses Ahwoi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds; &quot;To them (journalists) if there is no bad news about the government and key leading political figures, then there is nothing to write about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwesi Ahwoi is not alone in such condemnation. Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has often complained bitterly about the supposed anti-government stance of the media, particularly the independent press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plain truth is, the government feels the media have not been an ally in the authorities' desire to bring investment to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have played out to the propaganda of the West,&quot; retorts Kwesi Ahwoi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Ghana embarked on an Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) in 1983, the nation's major ambition has been to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. But this has not materialized to any appreciable level. The investors are not coming as expected, concedes Ahwoi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Ghana succeeded in attracting were only trickies of inflows averaging US$ 35 million of direct foreign investment from 1990 to 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of this, the country embarked on an aggressive and clearly focused image building campaign as a prelude to the investment generation and aggressive investment promotion activities. Between 1994 and March 1996, Ghana featured consistently in the International Herald Tribune, the Euromony Financial Times, Paris Match, Afrique Golfe, USA Today, Business Direction (Singapore) as well as other international journals. Even the Cable News Network (CNN) carried out an effective expose on Ghana as an emerging investment location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Rawlings' personal and direct involvement in the investment drive had also been very beneficial to the country, in that, some investors called in to find out more about the opportunities available after the President's visit to the United States, Singapore and Malaysia last year.  After the intensive image building campaign, Ghana reaped benefits of US$ 150 million from direct foreign investment in 1995 compared to only US$ 35 million average per annum for the preceding years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahwoi says with this seemingly breakthrough, Ghana has succeeded in emerging as a politically and socially stable country with a steady and predictable macroeconomic regime characterized by consistent and emerging transparent and predictable business regulations and procedures. &quot;What is left now is to sustain this position and image, and the local media acting as feeders to the international media have a far greater responsibility and role to secure this,&quot; he stresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The promotion centre head together with other government officials think the Ghanaian media have a different agenda which appears not to be in line with the country's collective interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the President of the Ghana Journalists Association, Mr. Kabral Blay-Amihere thinks otherwise. &quot;If anything, the government should be proud of our performance in calling to attention certain abnormalities in the running of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reckons that if the government thinks that media practitioners should close their eyes to all the happenings around them and offer the government unalloyed support, then journalists would be doing a disservice to the nation. After all, the media are expected to play a vanguard role which is being fulfilled accordingly, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwesi Essuman, a veteran journalist, concedes that there may be certain excesses by some journalists, but on the whole, he thinks that his colleagues have really put the Ghanaian authorities on their toes, hence the concern being expressed by government officials. &quot;In the absence of any credible opposition in Parliament, the lot fell on journalists and we have done very well,&quot; he observes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, following a boycott of the Parliamentary elections by the opposition in 1992, the need for a credible opposition seems to have eluded Ghanaians and the media seemingly took it upon themselves to play that role through occasional scrutiny of government policies - a role that has driven the two institutions apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most Ghanaians however agree that but for the media, the country could have been run as a one-party state. They agree there have been certain excesses, but these they contend, had come about because of the government's inflexibility and insensitivity to a number of issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, Ghana is at crossroads, where every opportunity that avails itself should be used to stimulate critical discussions, appraisals and decisive action in the drive forward into sustainable nationhood. And this can only be done in a give and take atmosphere, where the government would not subject itself to its line of thoughts alone, but also be guided by constructive criticism which is a basic ingredient for any democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The shea butter tree grows wild in much of the savannah woodlands of the Sudan-Sahelian region of Africa. In West Africa, the shea butter tree is well established as a cash crop. In East Africa, by contrast, the British colonizers ignored it entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now a Ugandan non-governmental organisation (NGO) is teaching local women in the northern part of the country how to process food and cosmetic oil from this neglected wilderness resource. The intention is to generate household incomes and save the environment at the same time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women in Otuke county of Lira district, northern Uganda, are the main beneficiaries of an oil crop project that should boost household incomes considerably in this otherwise neglected area. Otuke in the north-eastern corner of Lira district is a marginal area even in the context of northern Uganda. Households here are among the poorest in the country, having few opportunities to improve their standard of living and often facing real difficulties in meeting basic daily needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time as the project boosts household incomes the local environment in Otuke will be conserved because the people see the need to do so. The source of the oil is a wild tree called Butyrospernum paradoxum more commonly called the shea butter tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the aegis of the shea project of the Cooperative Office for Voluntary Organisations of Uganda (COVOL-Uganda), the shea nut is harvested from the wild where it grows in great abundance in the whole of Otuke county and indeed, the vast savannah region beyond. This area, measuring up to millions of hectares of savannah woodland, extends into southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shea butter is well known in West Africa where it is a long established oil crop. By contrast in East Africa, it is hardly known, perhaps because the British colonial administrators saw no need to encourage its cultivation when there were other oil crops like sesame, groundnut, coconut, and cotton -- the traditional vegetable sources of oil for the manufacture of soaps and cooking oils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later the British encouraged the importation of huge amounts of palm oil from plantations in the Far East. Today, Kenya alone annually imports $200 million worth of vegetable oils, much of which the country could produce itself if the authorities cared to set up the right environment for oil production locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main oil crop for the women of northern Uganda is sesame (simsim) which is both a source of protein for domestic consumption with only a little amount ending up as oil for the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For domestic consumption in Otuke county, the sesame is ground to afine paste and mixed into soups. It is excellent food for children and adults alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to its potential as domestic cooking oil, shea butter is also in high demand as a cosmetic product. Much of the production of shea butter from Ghana goes to Bodyshop, the main retailer of natural beauty products in Great Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Eliot T. Masters, coordinator of the shea butter project in Lira district is very keen on its environment protection component. &quot;It is an integrated long term effort to reinforce a local economy based upon conservation of savannah woodland, in collaboration with the people and the many community based NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We see the primary goal of the project as prevention of environmental degradation before it occurs.&quot; The emphasis is on sustaining the ecological balance in the marginal Lango countryside,adds Masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says this is possible because the need for sustainability of the project is inculcated in the women and other participants at the outset. And this is backed by a series of incentive factors. &quot;It takes 15 years for the shea butter tree to reach productivity stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who wish to grow it are free to do so. However, most women have chosen to harvest the nut from the wilderness while at the same time conserving the woodlands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A highly motivated rural development worker, Masters says the project will remain &quot;fundamentally linked to female incomes and household food security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes it is important to reduce the demands on female time and labour since rural women have other numerous time consuming or labour demanding chores in their daily routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simple mechanical oil presses developed at the University of Technology in Kumasi, Ghana have been introduced in Otuke to help boost productivity.  Two West African experts are helping the women of Otuke to familiarize themselves with the oil extruder presses from Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masters is confident that the COVOL project will meet its target of producing 30 tonnes of oil within 18 months. At least 20 tonnes of this will be sent to Ghana for onward export to England. COVOL has a working arrangement with a company in Ghana that sells shea butter to Bodyshop and they are keen to encourage further shea butter output from Eastern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Shea Butter Project will initially run for three years. Several thousand dollars have been secured as funding for the project, with most of the money coming from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Kampala based Grants Management Unit, Action Programme for the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masters is constantly looking for new outlets for COVOL's products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is in contact with refugee agencies in northern Uganda with a view to selling them a substantial amount of their output for the nutritional uses of refugees in Uganda and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the likelihood that the large number of Sudanese refugees in camps in Uganda will spontaneously set out to produce shea butter oil themselves since the required raw materials are vastly available all over northern Uganda and southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local conservation and development of shea butter will be reinforced by; technical improvement of shea processing to maximize efficiency of women's labour; extension services addressing the needs of local farmers; environmental education through extension services and local micro-enterprise development with a small loans scheme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - A thirty day ban on all exports of scrap metal was announced by mines deputy minister Ackim Nkole in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press briefing yesterday Nkole said that the ban was effective from yesterday and was aimed at facilitating the &quot;cleaning up&quot; of the scrap metal dealers association's operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No scrap metal inspection certificates will be issued with effect from today,&quot; Nkole said, &quot;there will be no exports of scrap metal for a period of thirty days.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkole said that during the ban period, scrap metal licenses would not be processed and there will be a review of all licenses issued out and scrutiny of applications before issuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkole revealed in an interview that despite several successful arrests in cases of copper thefts there had been no prosecutions which he attributed to an incompetent police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The law provides for stiff penalties. The offender is liable to 15 years imprisonment but no one has been prosecuted despite the many arrests,&quot; Nkole carped. &quot;It is incompetence to send a starving prosecutor to an offender because he will just be given whisky and the case is no more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further called for the re-classification of the copper thefts charge as a capital offence so as to scrap bail which enabled the offenders to manipulate all evidence against them allowing them to go scot free.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Scrap Metal Dealers' association was however divided over the ban with some members calling for a grace period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is need for the ministry to allow us about two weeks to clear off our stock and meet some conditions of some contracts we've gone into with our partners abroad,&quot; scrap dealer Kambwili Chishimbwe suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Scrap Metal Dealers Association welcomed the move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an interview yesterday the association vice chairman, Chris Kelari, thanked the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has been lenient to us, a 30 day ban is better than forever and we are happy that now the government is working towards formally recognising us,&quot; Kelari said</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I haven't as yet got any information of any problems in darts, but if there are any problems, we will surely have to sit down to resolve the issue,&quot; said Chamunda said in an interview in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have nothing against the mother body but the problem is that some people within DAZ want to personalise the issue.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Tempers flared at the interparty meeting in Kitwe last Friday, as opposition parties and the ruling MMD clashed over recent threats of donor aid cuts, sending the meeting into disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The highly charged meeting attended by the MMD, UNIP, ZDC, National Party and Movement for Democratic Process (MDP) failed to come up with resolutions after 12 hours of heated arguments over recent calls by some opposition parties for a donor aid squeeze against the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition parties, led by the National Party, refused to budge when MMD proposed that a communique be jointly signed by all opposition parties condemning recent threats by the donor community of aid cuts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not going to be hoodwinked into legitimising a hostile and dictatorial government by appending our signatures to this trickery,&quot; National Party provincial chairman Simon Kunda charged immediately after MMD delegation leader Kaunda Lembalemba made the proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD maintained that unless the communique was signed, they would not accept all the other resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is either you take this resolution by the MMD who in this case are in majority, or we forget about this inter party meeting all altogether,&quot; Lembalemba argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lembalemba further accused the opposition of not adhering to the principles of democracy, among which was tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the opposition was not deterred by Lembalemba's threats and maintained that unless the MMD reasoned with them on the matter, they would not mind forgetting about the meeting as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MMD should learn to reason and not suppress other parties' views, otherwise there is no need for sitting in conference rooms talking to an adamant and disrespectful party like the MMD,&quot; ZDC Copperbelt Provincial senator, James Chilemu, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) president, Alfred Zulu, was left with no alternative but to postpone the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD and opposition party cadres kept on jeering and chanting slogans in support of their own stances with the ruling party members accusing their colleagues from the opposition of being unpatriotic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the meeting was adjourned MMD members shouted abuse at the opposition leaders and continued singing and denouncing the donor community for threatening aid cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angry MMD cadres later started singing that since the talks had failed the solution was to fight it out so that the winners would be left to rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MDP president Chama Chakomboka said he was disappointed with the conduct of the MMD, saying the country was quickly drifting into a one party monopoly state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba's government has been accused by Amnesty International, a human rights organisation, of &quot;playing political games&quot; by detaining UNIP leaders on charges of treason which is punishable by death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International, in a facsimile message to The Post on Friday and distributed to various political leaders on Saturday, said the arrest and detention of the eight UNIP leaders, who include vice-president senior chief Inyambo Yeta, might have been politically motivated and for that reason the international community would keep an eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The international community will be closely watching to see what evidence has been collected in support of making these arrests on suspicion of treason,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International demanded that if the UNIP leaders are being detained simply because of political differences they should be released immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If these men are, indeed, being held because of opposing the President politically, Amnesty International would consider them prisoners of conscience and would demand their immediate and unconditional release,&quot; the statement read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International wondered how the eight could be linked to the clandestine Black Mamba which was responsible for a spate of bomb blasts and threats because when their homes were searched by police who were apparently looking for bomb-making materials, guns or incriminating documents, no evidence was reportedly found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Amnesty international's concerns are heightened by lack of concrete evidence to justify these arrests which lends weight to the organisation's fear the real reason for these men's detention is to prevent them from carrying out non-violent political activity in line with their beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Is there enough evidence to hold them without chance of bail at Lusaka Central Prison which has notoriously poor conditions?&quot; wondered the human rights organisation, whose secretariat is in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted, police spokesman, Francis Musonda, declined to talk about the detention saying &quot;it is already in court&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International, however, called for the detainees to receive a fair and prompt trial in accordance with international standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said it was also aware that police were seeking to make further arrests and was concerned that there might also be political motives as what happened in 1993 when several UNIP members were wrongfully detained in connection with The Zero Option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Barotse cultural Association at a mass rally by opposition parties on Saturday condemned the detentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chiluba can't respect any traditional leadership because he does not know where he comes from,&quot; charged BCA publicity secretary, Mutungulu Wangu.  &quot;Kaunda never hid his background that is why he respected traditional rulers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition parties have praised the donor community for withholding aid to Zambia and are now calling for frontline states to close their borders to government traffic and bar delegations from attending regional conferences until good governance is upheld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This agreement was announced at a mammoth rally attended by eight political parties near Kafue round-about on Saturday. The rally, which had police mounting the largest security operation in the political history of the country, saw 700 paramilitary police officers, a hundred of whom were armed, 14 on horseback and two supporting helicopters monitoring the proceedings on the ground.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We mounted this operation to protect them and to show anyone with ill intentions that they cannot do so,&quot; Wynter Kabwiku, officer commanding Lusaka Division said, adding: &quot;We have been liaising with the organisers of this rally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) did not attend but its Eastern Province Senator, Andrew Banda, who attended in his individual capacity apologised for the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda wished he had traveled to Lusaka earlier to convince other leaders about the importance of unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint opposition statement read by Liberal Progressive Front chairman, Rodger Chongwe, said: &quot;We salute the donor community for finally heeding the calls of the oppressed people of Zambia, that they prefer to live in abject poverty as is the case now than under a donor funded dictatorial oligarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We call upon the front line states to close their borders to Zambian government traffic and ostracise its delegations to regional conferences until the government is seen to be upholding the principles of good governance that brought them into power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition also said they would not honour the newly amended constitution until it was adopted by a constituent assembly and a National Referendum or else the 1996 elections be held under the 1991 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also demanded for the immediate re-registration of voters and that the one done by Nikuv Computers Limited of Israel be ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also demanded for an independent electoral commission whose composition should be accepted by all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We challenge the constitutionality of the Public Order (Amendment) Act, 1996 and demand its immediate repeal,&quot; resolved the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also expressed displeasure at the provocative adverts made by government leaders in the public media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also decided that police should not superintend the elections and that no MMD cadre should be recruited in the police service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the beginning of the rally police officers, mostly youthful recruits who were commanded to surround the assemblage met with overpowering resistance prompting their commanders to withdraw them to Kafue Road side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda, disturbed by the police, took it upon himself to talk to the commanding officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the crowd former president Kaunda demanded to know who was selling copper and cobalt for ZCCM since the closure of MEMACO and why President Chiluba was clinging to the Gabon and the Mukwela Rail Disaster reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What does he want to do with those reports? See now another rail disaster has occurred in Kapiri Mposhi, we must know what is causing these accidents,&quot; Kaunda demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said under any circumstance he would face and defeat President Chiluba in the elections and that would be when the President would account for the &quot;sins&quot; of his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the leaders present at the rally condemned the detention of the UNIP leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Operations of the Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA) will not be affected by the withdrawal of donor aid, assured its chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitalu said the agency, which has been supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), would be able to sustain its operations from the present funds collected from the sale of companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The programme is sufficiently advanced to be able to sustain the privatisation of state enterprises if the donors were to withdraw their aid now ,&quot; said Chitalu. &quot;But donor aid has been of great help to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitalu also disclosed that the agency was expecting two more trading groups , along the lines of the Shoprite chain, to open up shops in the country. But he could not disclose which country they were coming from. It is, however, believed that the two are South African chains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitalu announced that Choma Milling had been sold to A B Georgitsis and R.L Musenge of Nshima Milling at a price of K1 billion. An initial deposit of K450 million, being 45 per cent of the purchase price, has been paid to the Privatisation Revenue Account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The balance of K550 million, or 55 per cent, will be paid over a period of six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZPA has also sold Kabwe Industrial Fabrics, a 100 per cent state owned enterprise manufacturing a variety of industrial packaging materials, to Tate and Lyle, a UK based multinational corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulungushi Sawmilling and Joinery of Kitwe has been bought by Lusaka's former mayor Fisho Mwale and Siteke Mwale at K300 million. A 20 per cent deposit has been paid while the balance will be paid in a period of three months</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President lied to the country's cooperating partners that he was not going to assent the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the more MMD leaders tried to justify the clause requiring one's parents to have been born in Zambia to qualify for presidency the more their deceit that the clause was not aimed at UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda was laid bare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD members of parliament and cadres celebrated when the Bill was passed that former president Kaunda has been blocked. &quot;Kaunda alala, Kaunda alala...,&quot; was the MMD slogan in, and outside Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba has, in many ways, argued that Kaunda has had his fair chance of ruling Zambia and should be stopped, clearly indicating that the presidential clause, although affecting many other citizens, was primarily targeted at Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the presidential clause is not the only unacceptable thing about President Chiluba's constitution. There are many other clauses, including the mode of adoption, that still require consensus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - South African journalists have launched a national and international campaign to forestall the impending closure of South Africa's state funded external shortwave broadcasting station, Channel Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of the committee set up to spear head the campaign, Promise Lekalake, said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg yesterday that the overwhelming majority of journalists in South Africa favour the continuation of the station as it is viewed as a national asset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is regretful that an organisation like Channel Africa which was so active in promoting and developing understanding of South Africa's position in Africa has to be the subject of closure,&quot; Lekalake carped.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Lekalake, Channel Africa &quot;reigned supreme during the apartheid era&quot; and wondered why it should be closed now.  &quot;It is sending wrong messages,&quot; Lekalake said. &quot;It boils down to politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, in a press statement sent to The Post , SABC radio chief executive, Govin Reddy, observed that Channel Africa is a comprehensive and authentic African communications forum which serves Africa from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is totally objective and credible and reliable. It is dedicated to the promotion of positive development in Africa and is committed to the enhancement of dialogue and co-operation between all African people as their channel of goodwill,&quot; Reddy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African foreign affairs minister, Alfred Nzo, announced last month that the station would be closed as no provisions for funds had been made in his ministry's budget for 1996/97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Channel Africa was first established in 1966 as Radio RSA but repositioned itself as Channel Africa in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, the station has an estimated 15 million regular listeners and broadcasts in three Southern African languages (Chinyanja, Silozi and Xitsonga), one East African language (Kiswahili) , as well as in English, French and Portuguese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, according to Lekalake, the station employs several foreign journalists, among them Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cabinet is meeting next week to put a seal to the decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plain clothes policemen, some wearing National Airports Corporation identity tags were seen milling around the airport premises especially the main terminal building in which the explosion occurred.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Friday afternoon the debris had not yet been cleared and the toilet in which the explosion occurred was still barricaded and guarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Superintendent Ordon Banda, a police bomb disposal expert died in the explosion last Thursday after tampering with the device.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda was one of the officers who had been sent to Angola to participate in the peace-keeping mission following a cease fire in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He had just returned from a peace-keeping operation in Angola where he was for about one year,&quot; said his father, Makalipeni Banda, in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda, 45 , joined the police force in 1970 and is survived by a wife Florence, and five children. Burial takes place tomorrow.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The Chiefs of Staff of state members of the OAU central organ, met in early June at Africa Hall in what Secretary General Salim described as an 'eloquent illustration' of their commitment to fight 'the scourge of conflicts and instability in Africa and to promote peace and understanding on the continent.' Noting that it was the first of such gatherings, Dr. Salim reflected that since its inception in 1963, the founding fathers of the OAU, regarded peace as a 'sine que non for development and human progress.'</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the coming to an end of the Cold War that induced Africa to 're-think' as Dr. Salim put it, its place in the new world order. In July 1990, African heads of state met at their twenty- sixth session in Addis Ababa and adopted a new declaration. The 'fundamental changes taking place in the world and Africa's response' declaration, saw African leaders committing themselves to close cooperation to bring about peace and resolution of conflicts within Africa. In doing so Dr. Salim said, African leaders reconciled themselves to the reality that Africa would only be credible in the eyes of the African people and of the International Community when it took the lead in resolving its own problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - On returning from a working tour in Europe, Dr. Taye Woldesemiate, President of the Ethiopian Teachers Association (ETA) was arrested on arrival at Bole International Airport last Thursday. Dr. Taye had, during his tour, talked about human rights conditions in Ethiopia. He is at present being detained at the Central Investigation Bureau's prison according to the ETA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 4, the association drafted a letter to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. The letter appealed for 'urgent action against violation of ETA's Constitutional rights'. ETA noted that to date, it has written a total of 1098 letters to various government offices, including to the TGE's president and prime minister. None of these have received a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ETA's appeal to the prime minister centered on the 'repeated detention of teachers' elected representatives by government officials', 'illegal take over of ETA offices and facilities...', 'violation of the right to assemble' and 'the freezing of the bank account of teachers' welfare fund.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter referred to other grievances such as the search of Dr. Taye's home and office as well as his father's home, last March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Association put forward four demands, to the prime minister.  Included was the unconditional release of its president, Dr. Taye.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Reliable estimates indicate that one in every 5 children under the age of fifteen in Ethiopia lives under extremely difficult circumstances. Such children are victims of a variety of factors including abject poverty, rapid urbanization, drought and famine, and armed conflicts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">These children are constantly exposed to physical danger, exploitation, and all forms of abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which the Ethiopian Government has ratified, defines children's rights and services to which they are entitled as survival, protection, development and participation in social activities. It provides a set of universally accepted standards for their well-being and provides a legal framework which society can use to measure their progress in the protection, survival and development of the children.  The Convention pays special attention to children in especially difficult circumstances and calls for concerted action by governments and inter-governmental agencies to address the problems facing these highly vulnerable groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia is yet to formulate legislation to protect the rights of the child. We hope our legislators have the rights of the child legislation in their high priority list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime the police, and the kebele representatives should be educated on the rights of the child. Here in Addis, we have seen street children given harsh treatment by the police. We raise our voice against this abuse. We appeal to all concerned, especially to Region 14 and the Police Commissioner, to address this issue as soon as possible.</SPAN></P>

The newsletter reads that on April 1996, one hundred and three journalists were imprisoned around the world; Ethiopia and China hold 17 each.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These statistics are said to be based on infringements of the right to inform and be informed. The newsletter states that &quot; In 1995, fifty-one journalists were killed in the course of their work or because of their opinion (compared to 103 in 1994 and 59 in 1993). Three-quarters died on the African continent, mostly in Algeria. At least 386 journalists were imprisoned for at least 48 hours in 1995 because of their profession or their opinions, mainly in Asia (China, Burma, Vietnam), Africa (Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire) and North Africa and the Middle East (Syria, Algeria, Tunisia).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Congratulations to UNZASU and the student body for preserving the integrity of the history of the University of Zambia as the depository of the last resort of ideals and principles of equality, liberty and fraternity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was with a sense of total despair that I received the news of a planned solidarity march to State House by students for the purpose of celebrating the enactment of the MMD constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immoral procession was a betrayal of student ideals and sacrifice for the common good across the world. The Chinese students massacred in cold blood in Tianamen Square for demanding rights such as those taken away from Zambians by the MMD, Steve Biko, civil rights movements of the sixties at universities in America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearer home Ronald Penza, Super SAP Capitalist, sacrificed his government scholarship and worked his way through university by demanding of the UNIP government that they close the French Embassy for selling arms to apartheid South Africa.Betrayal of the ideals of Justice and Fair Play came with his job as an MMD politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Derick Chitala's ideals as a student made him an architect of the Garden House Meeting - his vision only became clouded when he became a Minister in the MMD government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Azwell Banda sacrificed ten years of his life working as an unqualified school teacher and only completed his degree as an old man rather than apologise to KK as was required of him which would have destroyed the standing of UNZA as a custodian of community ideals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Caine Mweemba is living in a servants quarter in order to uphold the history of the student movement in the world as the vanguard in the never ending struggle for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many others whose names are not known but who have sacrificed the hope of a lustrous career because as students they chose to stand for justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The duty of the University as the custodian of community ideals cannot be sold for 30 pieces of silver in the manner that the 16 or so Judas Iscariots who marched to State House did. Those students are intelligent enough to appreciate the fact that the Republican Constitution is not an MMD issue. And the best they could have done in their exercise of their constitutional right to free association would have been to join Chawinga and company in the dance at State House on May 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a country such as ours, in which Parliament has been corrupted, we can survive; the judiciary has been emasculated and we stagger on; Francis Ndlovhu is a political stooge who is doing everything possible to destroy the police service but sooner rather than later he will answer for it and the Police Service will continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a nation cannot survive the corruption of its University as clearly evidenced by the Rwandan experience where the privileged Tutsi university students rioted against the democratically elected Hutu President in that country's first free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was that unjust action by the students that ignited the tragedy that is Rwanda today, the genocide of 2 million people which included almost the entire student body and effectively sounded the death knell of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was with Rwanda in mind that on Saturday morning, I went to my favourite newspaper vendor. I returned home to view my certificate at it's usual pride of place, a proud Zambian and UNZA graduate. My children are looking after their today and tomorrow against those politicians that would seek to cheapen the proud history of UNZA, by enlisting students to support injustice and division that can only point to the death of a nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I notice that UNZA and Zambia is safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I salute you all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Paramilitary officers were on Sunday morning clobbered by University of Zambia (UNZA) students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A mob of irate UNZA students stoned several paramilitary officers and detained four others in the wake of confusion which has rocked the Great East Road campus since June 7 when 22 pro-MMD students marched to State House in support of the constitutional amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The paramilitary officers were deployed at the rooms of students who had gone to State House, a move which students perceived as &quot;intimidation by government&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba was reported as having assured the students who went to State House protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the paramilitary officers officers were forced out of the residential area and in the confusion a woman officer was severely beaten and disarmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several paramilitary officers were severely injured and had to run for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And even after burning the belongings of 9 of the 22 MMD activists, students have vowed that they will not allow those students who went to State House to enter campus again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not going to allow any of them to enter the campus again,&quot; declared a group of students. &quot;If anyone attempts to come, he or she will be burnt to death.&quot; president Emmanuel Tembo said in an interview yesterday the MMD cadres had offended all the other students whose good name they had attempted to tarnish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The offence of binding the whole student body to the statement that it was in favour of the constitution has been committed on all students,&quot; Tembo said, &quot;and it is only them who will decide whatever punishment to impose on all those who marched to State House.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tembo also claimed that most of the people who marched to State House were street vendors mobilised by MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Top in the group of the students who marched to State House are UNZA MMD Henry Malikyama who is also a relative of President Chiluba's private secretary Fabian Mumba, Bruno Lungu, George Chilengwe, Daudeni Phiri, Faith Kolala, Victor Tembo, chairperson for UNZA MMD ladies Martha Mwansa, Sandra Sisya (Zelu). Several MMD documents and campaign materials were found in their rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNZASU vice president Joseph Munsanje dismissed the allegations by the pro-MMD group leader Henry Malikyama that students who were against their solidarity march are being used by the opposition and said students were are not divided on the constitution as it has been portrayed in the government owned and controlled media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What MMD should know is that UNZASU has been operating even before the opposition parties came into being and it has its own way of reacting to issues,&quot; Musanje said in an interview yesterday. &quot;The student populace is not in support of the constitution as can be seen by their reaction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The waiter at the Time Square Cafe in Yeoville is a little startled when Sean Fourie and Paul Hanmer suddenly lean across the jumble of crumbs and crockery on the table and hug one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both pianists have recently completed their first major jazz recording projects. In Hanmer's case, it was the album Unofficial Language, with Peter Sklair and Ian Herman; in Fourie's, a leaderless collaboration, Jaci Dazz, with Valencia Ferlito and a whole bunch of others -- probably South Africa's first homegrown acid jazz album.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're about half-way through the interview, in an intense patch of discussion, and the two players are emphasising how, despite growing up separately, their lives in jazz have brought them inexorably to more or less the same place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which is two thirtysomethings sitting over coffee cups, contemplating an uncertain musical future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourie is big, blonde and cherubic, with the kind of easy looks that belong on the rugby- field, not crouched over a piano. Hanmer is slim, dark and ascetic, with the intensity of a tight-coiled spring. Yet the two have a lot in common -- starting with around two decades each in music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanmer, in Crawford in the Cape, followed his three sisters to piano lessons: &quot;I'd heard the youngest playing Bach, and I really got into that music, alongside the jazz, classical and big-band records that my parents loved to play. But when I started lessons, it wasn't so easy. The guys I went to school with would be hanging around on the corner as I sneaked past, whistling and jeering: 'Ya! Mozart!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The boys on the corner weren't the only obstacle. Hanmer gigged in amateur and later professional bands -- with The Sapphires, Taliep Peterson and others -- and began studying for a BMus degree. He quit as an escape from family pressures. &quot;My dad wanted me to switch to teaching, so that I'd have something to fall back on. But by then, I was so committed to music that I didn't want a fall- back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourie breaks in: &quot;Whereas my dad wouldn't let me have anything to fall back on. If I was going to go for music, I had to make it.&quot; Dad, of course, is highly respected guitarist Johnny Fourie. &quot;So,&quot; says Fourie, &quot;I never really had a choice. Dad would come in late and play John Coltrane till 5am when I was just waking up to go to school. I lived and breathed music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> School for Fourie stopped in standard six, after an incident involving an apoplectic, cricket-bat wielding, Afrikaans teacher. &quot;I wasn't going to take that kind of treatment, and my dad backed me up. So I stayed home and practised, with the sons of his friends. But we weren't serious yet: sometimes we'd break off practice just to rush out and play cowboys and indians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A series of teen and 20s bands -- Fragile Express, Adverse Edition -- ended for Fourie with chart success for a song called The Scheme of Things, which went to number one on Radio 5. He confesses that his stage name at that point was Sean Fury, and we all commiserate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both pianists want to kick against the musical barriers which South African history has set up. When Hanmer landed in Johannesburg in 1987, &quot;I initially saw it as a relaxed and open place. Then I found out about how segregated jazz music was -- not just in the obvious way, but segregated from resources and from exposure.&quot; Fourie agrees: &quot;We've been kept down, and we've been kept apart.&quot; Hanmer: &quot;The system divides you even from yourself.&quot; Cue for hug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both albums represent a rejection of the lowest-common-denominator approach of the South African music industry. Unofficial Language, says Hanmer, is &quot;a gesture to the unacknowledged many, to the culture that's been buried&quot;. Is it political music? &quot;No. In an unassuming way, we're just making music that could only have been born here. But at the same time, it's modern music. The record companies still have an anthropologist's view of the place, which only leaves room in jazz for the historic or the quaint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Fourie adds: &quot;People here are doing really hip, world-class things with three-chord structures, but they're not getting the support to take those ideas in new directions. On Jaci Dazz we took a listenable, commercial, new feel, but over that everybody improvised to express their own individual voices. Each song had an organic growth into its own completeness, without a record executive telling us what to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a dream for the future? For both, it's writing a movie soundtrack.  For Hanmer, the appeal lies in &quot;the discipline of writing to an image on deadline&quot;. Fourie breaks in impishly: &quot;And you get to put the most far-out sounds in, and the audience has to listen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Istanbul - They are calling it the &quot;brown agenda&quot; -- the search for ways through the murky soup of poverty, homelessness, pollution and deprivation afflicting the world's ever- expanding cities. It is a priority for the United Nations city summit, Habitat II, which opened in Istanbul on June 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scale and depth of the global urban crisis, says the official conference report, is far greater than previously thought. And it is steadily worsening as huge urbanisation takes place throughout Africa, Asia and Latin America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wally N'Dow, head of the conference, said: &quot;A low-grade civil war is being fought every day in the world's urban centres. Big numbers are risking their lives every day. Many cities are collapsing. We must wake up to the fact that it is no longer business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Urbanisation is bringing about one of the most significant transformations in history. The problems are staggering.&quot; There are now more than 600-million people officially homeless or living in life-threatening urban conditions. More than a billion lack sanitation and a further 250-million have no easy access to safe water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;The overwhelming speed at which the world is urbanising leaves little time to adapt. We are witnessing daily urban catastrophes. Youth is going to seed. Drugs are rampant in cities. Crime and terrorism are increasing. We risk a complete breakdown in cities. People feel alienated everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governments, local authorities and citizen groups were told in Istanbul that declining resources, growing competition, food scarcity and environmental problems will set the agenda for cities in the next 50 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most urban centres in the developing world will face extreme water shortages within 15 years, threatening life and health, N'Dow warned. &quot;More than one billion people cannot get clean drinking water. Dirty water causes 80% of diseases in the developing world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN report says one of the main reasons for the rapid deterioration in world cities in the past decade is structural adjustment programmes imposed by the International Monetary Fund. These, it is said, have increased poverty, homelessness and unemployment in more than 50 countries, including some of the poorest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Structural adjustment programmes were devised in the 1980s after the international debt crisis. They have demanded that developing countries privatise and deregulate industries, cut public spending and reduce or eliminate health and education subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says: &quot;In most countries undergoing structural adjustment, large numbers of people have lost what had been relatively stable jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One of the effects in the south has been to cut public spending and to reduce budgetary deficits. The cuts are usually in sectors not considered as priority or core productive sectors, which in many cases included human settlements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the blame is put on the rich for much of what N'Dow calls &quot;the emerging anarchy&quot; in the world's cities. He criticised the United States and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries for not accepting that people have a right to adequate housing and blamed liberalisation of trade and the activities of multinational corporations for accelerating urbanisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The world's aid agencies and development banks mostly give low priority to what is being called the brown agenda of sanitation, housing, air pollution and waste, which adversely affect the poor most,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report paints an alarming picture of growing crime accompanying urbanisation. &quot;The process of urbanisation goes hand in hand with a rise in urban violence that outstrips the growth of cities,&quot; said a UN adviser on urban poverty in a parallel report presented to the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'Violence is the product of a society characterised by inequality and social exclusion. The offender has often been stimulated by a social environment dominated by consumerism, competition and by the mass media, which propagate and legitimise violence,&quot; said Franz Vanderschuren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to studies in the US, watching violence encourages aggressive behaviour, increases violence and desensitises viewers. Research suggests that by the time a child leaves a US school, she or he will have seen 100 000 violent acts and 16 000 murders on TV. The annual cost of urban decay due to violence in the US is estimated at $50-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Highlighting the fact that urban decay has been accelerating while the numbers of young people in cities has been growing rapidly, the report says that about two-thirds of the rapidly growing urban population in Africa is now made up of the nought to 25 age group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It warns of the social and political risks in having very large numbers of &quot;unoccupied and very frustrated&quot; young people. One of the contributors to the report says that cities are increasingly prone to politicised urban violence, fundamentalist or mafiosi activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN was told that at least once every five years 60% of people living in cities with more than 100 000 people are victims of crime. Most urban crime is committed by the young against property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says that between 30% and 60% of all housing in most developing country cities is now illegal, with more than 75% of homes in cities such as the Kenyan capital Nairobi, and the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, built without permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN's city summit was not recommending giving more power to governments or new money to alleviate the problems of urbanisation, but a shift in decision-making to citizen groups and local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's a call for partnerships,&quot; said N'Dow. But not many heads of state attended the conference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Scepticism about lending to the poor is not confined to the corridors of banking. Few people believe that the poor, with virtually no jobs or income, no banking history or collateral, and no track record of repayment, could develop successful enterprises, pay back loans, and generate enough loan volume to be able to build successful institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Ecumenical Development Co-operative Society (EDCS) has succeeded where many others have failed: it boasts a 90% recovery rate after 21 years of operation and loan loss provision of 20% of outstanding balances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arguably one of the world's most successful lending organisations that targets the poor, and one of the only institutions in the sector with an average loan size of US$250 000, EDCS is soon to open its doors in South Africa, with Zanele Mbeki, former head of the Women's Development Bank in South Africa and wife of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, on its international board.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a fact-finding trip, Gert van Maanen, EDCS general manager, met South African players, including Cas Coovadia of the Community Bank, Zanele Mbeki and the Reverend Peter Story. They agreed a reference group should be set up.  The next step will be to recruit the EDCS branch manager in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past 15 years, numerous organisations such as the EDCS, the Grameen Bank, Accion International, BankoSol and Bank Rakyat have revolutionised the concept of lending to the poor. Loan sizes vary from a few dollars in the case of Grameen (average loan size of $75) to $250 000 in the case of EDCS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The common thread is that the loans are repaid; the institutions are viable, and the sector is growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How can these institutions lend profitably to the poor, despite the absence of almost all the four &quot;C's&quot; traditionally required by the commercial banking sector: collateral, capital, character and capacity?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The EDCS was founded in 1975 to mobilise financial credit and resources from the First World to aid development of the third world. It is not an aid agency -- it mobilises the institutional savings of the churches and the individual savings of church members and invests them in selected business ventures that have the potential to repay these loans with interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority of the bank's clients are groups, mostly co-operatives, rather than individuals. The bank finances productive investments that lead to sustainable income-generating activities (a viable business plan is a pre- requisite).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The success of the bank (90% repayment rate over the past 20 years) is related to its policy of financing activities defined by its members (the urban and rural poor) and not schemes drawn up by overseas consultants or international donor agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The activities must be within the reach of the borrowers and in line with their skills and experiences. Although collateral is seldom required, the borrowers are expected to raise a percentage of the loan amount (up to 20%) as proof of their commitment. The bank insists on ownership of the business venture by the borrowers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EDCS emphasises the participation of women up to management level, believing that the commitment of marginalised women to the success of a business venture goes far deeper than that of their men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interest rate charged by EDCS is related to its cost of capital and operations. The bank charges a flat rate of 9%, comprising 2% cost of capital; 3% operating costs; and 4% loan-loss provision. The loan period is generally between five and seven years (up to a maximum of 10 years) with either one or two years' grace period for the enterprise to gain economic strength. The flexible repayment period enables the bank to allow for cases of drought or loss of harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today EDCS works with more than 250 project partners in 65 countries worldwide. The minimum loan is $50 000 and the maximum is $1- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 50% of EDCS loans have gone to agriculture or agri-related business and a growing percentage to financial intermediaries (similar to, although not including, the Community Bank of South Africa), which then on-lend the EDCS loan to their own members in smaller amounts. Since the bank opened its doors in 1975, it has disbursed nearly 120- million guilders ($62-million).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Confidence index drops. The 0,4% drop in last month's business confidence index compiled by the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), came as no surprise, given the economic slowdown and negative implications of the interest-rate hike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sacob said the worsening business sentiment was being reinforced by a &quot;perceived inability of government to show sufficient leadership in respect of key policy issues&quot;. Sacob has cut its economic forecast for the year by a half percentage point to 3,1%, but does not expect the weaker rand to impact too severely on inflation. Its forecast for the year is little changed from the original 8% year's average.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Johnnies Industrial Corporation is teaming up with United States-based Conrad International Hotels Corporation to pursue a casino licence application for a R1,5-billion mega-gaming complex planned on 19 hectares of land adjacent to Gallagher Estate's conference centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russel Jackson, general manager of Johnnic's commercial property division, said the company had negotiated an option to acquire 51% of Riccia Property Holdings, owner of Gallagher Estate, conditional on obtaining a licence. &quot;In partnership with black business interests and Conrad International, we plan to establish an international hotel, entertainment and exhibition complex on the enlarged site,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *ABSA gets cold feet - AMALGAMATED Banks of South Africa has put on ice plans to tap the London capital market, crucial to its offshore expansion plans. Spokesman Alec Hogg said the decision stemmed from the rand's plunge and the negative perception of South Africa, which had been spurred by &quot;certain immature and ignorant statements on the SA economy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *BB rating for SA - London-based credit rating agency IBCA has left South Africa's long-term foreign currency rating as BB, a non- investment rating. The IBCA said the rating applied to senior and unsecured long-term government debt securities, and acted as a ceiling to IBCA ratings for other South African issuers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foreign currency rating compared with that of Mexico's and was better than the rating for Romania, IBCA said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The privatisation of Mossgas will enter the final lap this month when the deadline for interested buyers passes on June 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government and the merchant banks handling the sale hope to find a buyer by October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">While they sift through the offers, they will pin an order of priority to sale price, jobs, foreign exchange savings and other sale &quot;criteria&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite the expense of hiring merchant banks and advisers to steer the sale there remain some government officials close to the process who are not keen for Mossgas to be sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They want Mossgas to become part of a national oil company, Sanoco, which would also include Engen, Sasol Oil and Mossgas's sister company, state exploration group Soekor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Sanoco backers, who reside in the finance and trade and industry departments, have touched on the plans with the companies involved, there has so far been no open debate about the merits of a national oil company. It was never stated as policy by Minerals and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sasol said last month it had &quot;had dialogue&quot; with government about Sanoco.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Government is finally realising that actions speak louder than words. Within two weeks South Africa should not only have a growth plan in place but also firm proposals for the restructuring of state assets -- three years after the African National Congress made privatisation official policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is due to present his long-awaited growth plan, as foreshadowed at the intergovernmental conference in February. Three days later, ministers will meet labour representatives to thrash out a detailed policy for state sell-offs. With the basic guidelines in place, they will consider each industry and how best to go about transforming individual companies. At the same time, the government will announce its team of advisers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The going may not be easy, however. Cosatu is sticking to its guns, says representative Nowetu Mpati. &quot;We are completely against privatisation, and remain so until we see the data to convince us that it can be done without significant job losses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But other union representatives believe a softening of Cosatu's stance is possible. &quot;We can no longer afford to put ideology before the good of the country. Even Cosatu must understand that,&quot; said one official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increased openness has contributed to this view. &quot;The new approach of consultation and transparency has gone a long way to clearing the air. It is no longer a question of them and us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the new pragmatism, the issue of job losses still looms large.  Says Colin Smith, privatisation co-ordinator and bi-lateral task-team negotiator for Fedsal: &quot;We fully support a case-by-case approach to privatisation; we cannot take a blanket decision to sell off every state asset. But we have to use partnerships, joint ventures and retraining to minimise, if not totally avoid, any job cuts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This view is echoed by Professor Ben Turok, an ANC MP. &quot;Just because we believe in free- market principles does not mean we should privatise willy-nilly. The British experience is a perfect example of the dangers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many state institutions are grossly inefficient and misdirecting resources. We have to make sure the taxpayer is not subsidising inefficient use of resources and some form of privatisation could help to get them back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But worries about possible job losses are valid and all the more reason for taking a case-by-case approach and acting on sound economic principles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Louise Tager, head of Transnet, is not convinced privatisation is the answer. &quot;Where does it say that the state cannot run a business successfully? We are trying to sort things out internally, improving efficiencies and productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Certainly, some parts could be sold off, but wholesale privatisation is not a good idea. The country cannot afford it. For every job lost, up to six people lose their support system; we have to be careful not to exacerbate the already serious unemployment problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With most of the companies earmarked for restructuring in growth industries such as telecommunications, tourism and airlines, fears of job losses may be overplayed, says an analyst. So far, government has taken an ad hoc approach, forging ahead with little consultation and even less focus. But getting the unions on side will take more than just rhetoric and reassurances. It's up to the government to set out its objectives and make them work.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Cup of Nations title holders managed only one goal during the game played in front of 60,000 soccer fans at Blantyre's Chichiri stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Neil Tovey, who earned a record 37th cap yesterday, headed a strong defence with the local team holding the ball for 55 per cent of the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Africans, ranked 20th in the world, were expected to win the game against the 113th-ranked Malawians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But they will face pressure to perform when they play Malawi during the second leg of the preliminary round at Johannesburg's FNB stadium on June 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Bafana Bafana qualify for the preliminary round of the World Cup, they will have to play eight matches in Africa against the likes of Ghana and Nigeria. The World Cup takes place in France in two years' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SY LERMAN reports from Blantyre that South African coach Clive Barker said after the match: &quot;We should have buried them. We should have had at least four goals and made the second leg a formality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game's solitary goal was scored in the 21st minute by midfielder Eric Tinkler after man-of-the-match John &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu had mesmerised the Malawian defence with a deft dummy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - UNIP chairman Malimba Masheke yesterday said his party was planning a combination of mass demonstrations, rallies and court action to fight government attempts to link UNIP to the shadowy Black Mamba organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to organise the people because no one can rule if the people don't want him to rule,&quot; Masheke said at a press briefing at Freedom House yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masheke reiterated that the Black Mamba scare was an MMD creation designed to facilitate the declaration of a state of emergency in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Black Mamba is being linked to UNIP because Chiluba wants to use it to declare a state of emergency,&quot; Masheke said. &quot;We are top UNIP members and it can't be UNIP if we don't know about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masheke said UNIP had information that 31 of its members including all central committee members were due to be picked up in the continued police swoop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masheke also announced that opposition parties including the Zambia Democratic Congress, Liberal Progressive Front, National Party, National Democratic Alliance and others are due to share the platform this Saturday at which there will be major pronouncements on last month's inter party talks which were boycotted by MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party chairman Edward Shamwana in a separate interview regretted the arrests of the UNIP leaders and said it was sad that the opposition could not be allowed to operate freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This seems like a ploy to frighten the opposition so that it can be less vigorous in campaigning for issues,&quot; Shamwana said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Police, in a move seen as an attempt to paralyse the country's leading opposition party, yesterday continued to arrest senior leaders of UNIP - linking them to the 'Black Mamba'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amongst those arrested by yesterday is the party's vice-president, senior chief Inyambo Yeta, central committee member, former finance minister Rabson Chongo, and former president Kenneth Kaunda's special assistant, Muhabi Lungu, former Zambia Air Force officer, Capt Phangula Banda and former diplomat in Japan, George Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know that this is a deliberate plan by the MMD government to link all criminal activities like the Black Mamba to UNIP and especially to its president. We believe firmly that these criminal activities are contrived by the same accusers,&quot; said Muhabi Lungu on Sunday night, adding: &quot;The intention is to create so much distrust in the nation so as to find a pretext for declaring a state of emergency.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Barotse Cutural Association has condemned the detention of senior chief Inyambo and described the action as &quot;a dastardly and cowardly act calculated to bring Lozi Cultural heritage into ridicule and contempt.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This move is unprecedented since colonial days because a Lozi chief has never been detained. The BCA believes that the only reason why the senior chief has been detained is because he is a Lozi. The government should realise that senior chief Inyambo is not only the UNIP vice-president but also a very highly respected Lozi senior chief,&quot; the statement signed by BCA national chairman Batuke Imenda and his secretary Mutete Kashimani reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police Inspector General Francis Ndhlovu announced at a press briefing in Lusaka on Sunday that police had targeted about twenty people suspected to be responsible for the recent bombings and bomb threats by the Black Mamba over the constitution amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know them. We have some more names of people we want to arrest and it is better for them to surrender to the police,&quot; Ndhlovu warned at a press briefing on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Nicholas Zulu's wife Catherine, said the search at their home did not yield anything though they had charged her husband with treason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What treason are they talking about? They are just behaving like the Gestapo because there was nothing they found to implicate my husband,&quot; a visibly shocked Catherine, whose husband was arrested on Sunday, cried in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Inyambo's wife, Moonde, also said that the search did not yield anything though the police locked up her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They came home around 04:00 hours and had a warrant which said they were looking for illegal firearms and seditious material. After they failed to find anything they drove him to his office at Freedom House where they also searched but did not find anything,&quot; narrated Moonde in an interview yesterday. &quot;They later said they have charged him with a conspiracy to commit a felony. We don't even know what this felony is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Civic Education Association chairperson, Lucy Sichone, charged that the arrests were an act of provocation by the government on UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The arrests are completely unjustified and may lead into violence. All they are trying to do is to push UNIP into a situation where they will have no option but to erupt,&quot; Sichone charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five arrested yesterday bring the number to nine UNIP members who have so far been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others arrested include retired Brigadier General Joseph Chintomfwa, who also worked as director of Military Intelligence Services (MIS), ex-intelligence officer and UNIP secretary for defence, Patrick Goma, retired senior police officer and now Kenneth Kaunda's aide in charge of physical security, Morris Kaulung'ombe and another retired army officer Brigadier General Nicholas Zulu, who also worked as general manager for Mulungushi textiles in Kabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The list of detainees is expected to soar with amongst those targeted for arrest being UNIP Malambo Member of Parliament and son to Kenneth Kaunda, retired Major Wezi Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yesterday afternoon most of those arrested were not at the places of their detention as officers indicated the detainees had been taken to force headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Chilenje officers said Kaulung'ombe who had been detained there was taken to force headquarters just before 14hrs. At Emmasdale officers claimed gen Zulu had also been moved to the police headquarters while at Matero police officer G. Milupi referred all queries to Forece head quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot help you at my level and rank. Ask the inspector general or force public relations officer Francis Musonda,&quot; Milupi said. He could not indicate whether gen Chimtomfwa was in the cells or not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The forestry department in Petauke has within the last three weeks confiscated 15 cubic metres of illegal timber worth approximately K4.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The timber is all Mukwa, an expensive indigenous hardwood used in furniture production.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Due to illegal commercial cutting, Mukwa is a threatened species in Zambia,&quot; district forest officer Deuteronomy Kasaro disclosed in an interview last Friday. &quot;With the present cutting there will be no Mukwa left in Petauke District for commercial use within five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the forestry department's capacity to combat illegal mukwa cutting is highly impaired by lack of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't even have a vehicle but for three weeks we borrowed a truck from MS-Zambia (the Danish Association for International Cooperation), and we gained a lot from that,&quot; Kasaro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Kasaro, most of the illegal cutting is done by groups of individuals coming from other parts of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They camp in the bush where they find the Mukwa trees and cut them. The timber is usually transported to Lusaka by truck and from there sent out of the country, mainly to South Africa we are told,&quot; Kasaro said. &quot;The pit-sawers themselves do not earn much but the businessmen behind get a high profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Intentions by the USA government to review its bilateral and multilateral relationship, including assistance programmes, with Zambia are long overdue, charged Lucy Sichone in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sichone, chairperson of the Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA), claimed in an interview yesterday that the USA and other donors released funding for the Mwanakatwe Constitution Review Commission on condition that submissions would be taken back to the people for consensus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The action has been long overdue in view of the blatant breach of the arrangements agreed in the contract. The Americans should set a stage for other donors,&quot; Sichone said. &quot;They should not only stop the balance of payments support but all other form of aid to bring this government back to dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace(CCJP) chairman Fr Joe Komakoma observed that &quot;donor aid was always tied to good governance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If they feel that their conditions are not being fulfilled they are right to withhold the aid,&quot; Komakoma said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation for Democratic Process (FODEP) president Bishop John Mambo appealed to the donors to assist in resolving the constitutional impasse before things get out of hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Donors have the capacity to do that without waiting for a situation where they are going to be bringing aid in form of bandages and ambulances when there is confusion,&quot; Mambo advised in an interview yesterday, adding: &quot;They can use all the available means possible to bring the government back to the negotiating table on the constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba's security men last Friday accused two Post Copperbelt correspondents of being members of the Black Mamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two correspondents, covering the Copperbelt Agricultural Show in Kitwe, were removed from where a group of journalists from the government owned and controlled Times of Zambia and Daily Mail were gathered, claiming they were a security risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One security officer identified as Paggy Kalawela charged at Elias Kamanga and Brian Malama grabbing a camera and accused them of being part of the Black Mamba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You guys from The Post have launched a serious campaign against President Chiluba. My instructions are that you should not get any closer to the President,&quot; Kalawela said in the presence of several other reporters from Times of Zambia and Daily Mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two journalists were then pushed out of the stand President Chiluba was touring and Kalawela placed police to guard the entrance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have instructions to obey and we will do just that. We have been instructed to scrutinise all reporters covering this function and as far as we are concerned you are a security risk,&quot; Kalawela charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But when asked why Post journalists were being discriminated, home affairs minister Chitalu Sampa, who witnessed the scene, denied there were any such instructions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have no idea whatsoever of such orders, though security men have the right to block those they deem as security risks from nearing the President,&quot; Sampa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scene was described as &quot;unfortunate&quot; by former information minister Stan Kristafor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think members of the press can be a security risk,&quot; Kristafor said. &quot; I hope they don't link The Post to the Black Mamba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government yesterday claimed they had information of a campaign to be launched by The Post and some opposition parties to discredit President Chiluba and make the country ungovernable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Federal Republic of Germany embassy in Lusaka is waiting for 'an appropriate' responce from Bonn on measures to take against Zambia over the wish of the people that a clause be inserted in the Constitution which will restrict the Presidency to citizens of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charge de Affairs at the Embassy, Axel Zeidler, disclosed in Lusaka today that the embassy had sent a report to Bonn recommendation that some measures be taken against the Zambian people following the enactment of a law restricting the Presidency to Zambian citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is unfortunate that government did not listen to the concerns raised by donors over this matter,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information and Broadcasting Minister, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, said Government was aware of the German position and that they were still studying the statement and would issue a comprehensive statement at an appropriate time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Saturday the United States said it is reviewing its bilateral and multilateral relationship with Zambia, which will include development aid cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US State department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, says the move has been prompted by the passing into law the Constitutional Amendments which restrict the presidency to Zambians whose ancestry was also Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These amendments seriously threaten the intergrity and credibility of the electoral process and significantly undermine Zambia's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In light of the Government of Zambia's action, the United States is reviewing its bilateral and multilateral relationship, including assistance programmes in Zambia,&quot; Mr Burns warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained tht the warm relations between his country and Zambia, and the partnership in Zambia's development, were based on the shared commitment to democracy and economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have repeatedly made known to the Government of Zambia our deep concerns over these amendments and other recent actions that threaten Zambia's new democractic system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The United States urges the Government of Zambia to reverse its decision on the Constitutional amendments, to renew its commitment to democracy, and to take immediate steps to ensure that this year's elections are free and fair,&quot; Mr Burns said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But reacting to the statement, Finance Minister Ronald Penza regretted the stand adopted by the US government explaining that even before President Frederick Chiluba signed the Constitutional Amendment bill he had held wide consultations with representatives of donor countries, including that of the US.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Penza observed that the amendments introduced in the constitution had originated from the people and it was, therefore, regrettable that the US government was unable to respect genuine wishes of the Zambian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Penza expressed hope that the radical stand of the US government will not be copied by other western governments now helping Zambia with funding for development programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition United National Independence Party president, Kenneth Kaunda, reacted with glee at the news that the US government was about to cut aid to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Kaunda, who has been among those calling for sanctions against the Zambian government, said in Lusaka that he hoped other donor countries will follow the example set by the US government and introduce similar measures too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others calling for cuts have been Zambia Democratic Congress President Dean Mung'omba and Liberal Progressive Front leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Government will only react to the threatened US State Department sanctions after it is formally informed of the decision, President Frederick Chiluba said on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mr Chiluba hoped that the United States of America, a leading country in the world, will use its enormous clout constructively especially with regard to the Washington based Bretton Woods Institutions which are the biggest source of financial support for Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He maintained, quite firmly however, that the Zambian government is there through a popular mandate from the people of Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It has an unquestionable mandate. And parliament in accordance with the Constitution of Zambia has the exclusive preserve to legislate for Zambia.  There has been no impropriety in the enactment of the Constitution Amendment Bill which was a matter of putting into law the legitimate wishes of the Zambian people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adding that those Zambians who hold contrary views have all the opportunity later in the year to put their case sto the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the only acceptable way in any democracy to proceed if the law of the jungle is to be avoided,&quot; He added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President pointed out that Zambia has since 1991 struggled to repair a severely shattered economy and Zambians have made enormous sacrifices and thanks to the very substantial support from the international donor community we have made some progress which, if sustained, will provide a sound base for sustainable economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba noted that Zambians are at a critical turning point and that help from the donor community is definitely crucial if the achievements of the last four years are not to be eroded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he stressed that the responsibility of developing Zambia is of Zambians and other countries in the international community can only help supplement these efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia will for some foreseeable future continue to have substantial resource gaps which will be difficult to bridge from the low and slow internal accumulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The most appropriate reaction for Zambians to threats of curtailment of foreign aid is for us to increase our resolve to work harder. The farming community has set the tone and the performance should improve in the next crop season. There should also be more extensive use of irrigation to reduce dependence on rainfed agriculture,&quot; Mr Chiluba observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He declared that Zambia's committment to democracy and good governance is irrevocable. It is the only way to safeguard Zambia's future and is not a gimmick for obtaining aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that Zambians are peace loving people and we can boast of a proud record of harmony in diversity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two hundred Zambian women have registered with the National Women's Lobby Group so that it can help them contest the coming presidential, parliamentary and local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Non-Governmental Organisations Cordinating Committee Chairperson, Susan Jere, disclosed this in Lusaka last night when she appeared at the forum organised by the recently revived Zambia Media Women's Association (ZAMWA) at Pamodzi Hotel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Jere explained that it was important for organisations like Women's Lobby to throw their weight behind women candidates because at the moment Zambian women are at a great disadvantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on the theme 'Women in Politics,' Mrs Jere lamented that women politicians were greatly handicapped by a lack of resources and proper education noting that in some cases women activists failed to advance in their chosen careers because the electoral process required them to be adept at speaking English, which is the official language in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women politicians, she added, had no resources with which to match those of men opponents adding that Zambian politicks have been marred by corruption as candidates have to give gifts to voters if they hoped to be elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Jere also moaned over the party structures which stiffled women adding that in these organisations most officials were 'gender insensitive'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She urged women to start organising for the coming elections so that at the end of the day they too can have their representatives who can fight for their own rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Jere, who resigned from the organisation so that she could go full time into politics, has joined the Zambia Democratic Congress and she is hoping to contest the Chawama parliamentary constitutency seat in Lusaka which is presently held by Foreign Affairs Minister, Lt-General Christon Tembo, on a Movement for Multi-Party Democracy ticket.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Three of Zambia's biggest hopes for track and field medals at this year's Olympic Games in Atlanta blazed to impressive performances in four different countries in the last few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Samuel Matete, Godfrey Siamusiye and Ngozi Mwanamwambwa raced to some awesome times in various competitions in the United States, Canada, Slovakia and France.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leading the charge was Matete who skipped past opponents to win the 400 meters hurdles in France on Monday with a time of 48.42 seconds. Matete beat Bryan Bronson, United States, 48.44; Winthrop Graham, Jamaica, 49.43; Eronildo De Araujo, Brazil, 49.56; Ken Harnden, Zimbabwe, 49.72; and Dusan Kovacs, Hungary, 49.89.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matete's victory in France's St. Denis International Meet was 060 faster than the time he ran on Wednesday in Slovakia when he won the IAAF Slovnaft International Meet in Bratislava, Slovakia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back in the United States, long-distance specialist Godfrey Siamusiye led University of Arkansas to its fifth consecutive men's team win during the NCAA Track and Field Championships on Saturday and Sunday in Eugene, Oregon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Siamusiye won the 10,000 meters race and finished second in the 5,000 meters. In one of the most impressive races on the NCAA circuit, Siamusiye edged teammate Jason Bunston at the finish to win the men's 10,000 in a thrilling race that featured three lead changes on the final lap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day later on Sunday, Siamusiye and Bunston finished second and third in the 5000, behind Colorado's Alan Culpepper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across North America in Canada, another Zambian star was working hard on the track. Mwanamwambwa was participating in the Jerome International track classic in Abbortsford, British Columbia. Mwanamwambwa, a graduate student in the United States, came third in the 400 meters race with a time of 54.21 behind Cathy Rattery-Williams of Jamaica, 52.04 and Elena Rusina of Russia, 53.45.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Lusaka Stock Exchange (LuSE) has recorded a low turnover for the months of April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is, however, showing increased participation from small investors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chilanga Cement Stock Price has dropped further and the company's shares are now trading at K50, as compared to K65 last year in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the LuSE May report says this drop in share price is not reflective of the general performance of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report insists that the downward pressure on the Chilanga share price is more of the result of cash trapped by first time shareholders trying to off load their shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These tend to be small volume investors. To assist these investors, the LuSE has written to all Chilanga share holders individually, providing them with information on how to manage their investments and use the stock exchange,&quot; read the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report also reveals that up to 540 million shares may be offered for sale by the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund on behalf of the government through a public floatation around September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The price earnings (PE) ratio would be 7.17 with a dividend yield of 7.75 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) share price has moved up in the last few weeks to K1,900 per share. The market capitalisation of ZCCM is now the highest on LuSE at K169,663 million followed by Zambia Sugar at K108,539 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Chiluba's assurance last Friday on the Copperbelt that the price of mealie meal will soon drop by half has been dismissed as mere politicking without any rational basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the Copperbelt Agricultural Show President Chiluba assured that the price of mealie meal will be reduced by almost 50 per cent to K7,000 for a 25 kg bag.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President pointed to the forecast bumper harvest as the basis for the mealie meal price reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But millers and farmers see things differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On what grounds can the price of mealie-meal come down so much?&quot; asked National Milling Company managing director, Mwansa Mutanuka, in an interview in Kitwe on Friday. &quot;This assertion is not backed by any positive factors in the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutanuka advised the government against interfering with mealie meal prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; I would love the government to let prices control themselves so that we don't run away from our commitment to a free market,&quot; Mutanuka advised.  &quot;You don't expect a miller to sell for less than he spends. That is not good economics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government was also advised to assess the ramifications of low mealie meal prices on farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If millers have to reduce their prices, farmers will moan. This is not a one way thing,&quot; Mutanuka said, asking: &quot;How does the government expect us to bring the price of mealie-meal down when it has not leveled the playing field regarding outside competitors who bring their mealie meal into the country at very cheap prices?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia National Farmers Union president, Ben Kapita, warned that tampering with mealie meal prices, for any political expediencies, will reduce maize production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The nation can then expect low maize production for the next season because farmers will not be able to recover their costs,&quot; Kapita warned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Hundreds of chanting UNIP cadres and sympathisers yesterday besieged the Supreme and Magistrates Courts grounds to wait for their eight leaders facing treason charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was euphoria as the cadres adorned in white head bands on which the message &quot;No Kaunda No election&quot;, was inscribed, ran all over the place, singing anti-Chiluba songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big banners carrying different messages were hang out for motorists and passers-by on Independence Avenue to read. Some of the messages read, &quot;ZCTU- Do you still trust this traitor Chiluba? Chiluba has sold Zambia to Nikuv, Chiluba can never be more Zambian than KK, UNIP- Kubwela Mukuteka ( UNIP is coming back to rule again)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workers from the Supreme and High Courts and the nearby offices abandoned their offices to witness the myriad of activities taking place outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As women cadres danced in jubilation and in praise of UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda, who was present at the scene, while the youths poured scorn on Chiluba, police recruits were brought in blue Land Rovers to contain the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the cadres put up their 'V' sign chanting &quot;We Want Peace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the situation became tense and more cadres poured in from different parts of Lusaka, a bus load of policemen appeared and the police were this time deployed at critical points mainly surrounding the court of the senior principal magistrate where the accused were to appear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the over 100 police recruits all with shot batons did not have it easy from the UNIP cadres, who constantly taunted them for &quot;being used by the Chiluba government instead of serving the nation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ba buju lelo muzaciwona. Ni ndewo naimwe chifukwa mwanyanya (Today you the police and us will fight. We are tired of your partisanship),&quot; cadres shouted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also not a pleasant day for journalists from the government-owned media who were harassed and told to leave the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Your masters will not allow you to report objectively,&quot; shouts came from the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A ZNBC cameraman was dragged and pushed around as he tried to cover the jubilating cadres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporter Della Phiri stood her ground and explained to UNIP Information and publicity secretary Bweendo Mulengela that she was simply doing her job.  Her resistance paid off and she managed to get her story but without her cameraman who ran off and took refuge in the High Court building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More ululations deafened the atmosphere when the suspects who included UNIP vice-president, senior chief Inyambo Yeta and two retired generals, Joseph Chitomfwa and Nicholas Zulu appeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And expelled Mongu National Party member of parliament Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika (Aka) 'proudly' walked with the eight accused persons through the police cordon right into the court room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If this is treason,&quot; Aka said, &quot;then the only exception to treason in Zambia is cowardice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police, including Lusaka police boss Wynter Kabwiku, who tried to bar supporters from entering the court were pushed aside by the surging crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as the court proceedings started, there was deafening noise both inside and outside the courts, forcing principal resident magistrate Francis Nsokolo to plead for silence from the jeering public.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) has officially lodged a protest to FIFA over the Saudi Arabian club's failure to release defender Elijah Litana on pretext that he was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have written to FIFA to protest at the conduct of the Saudi Arabian club because we feel they cheated that Litana was injured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are now awaiting the response from FIFA but we are confident that Litana will be released to play in the return match against Sudan,&quot; FAZ secretary general Hermann Mpashi said yesterday at a press conference at his Anchor House office yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mpashi charged that he had spoken to Litana before Zambia's departure to Sudan and was stunned when he was told later that the player was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had spoken to him (Litana) and he assured me that he was coming but I was surprised that his club officials phoned later to inform us that he was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But the rumours we got were that his club was engaged in a Cup Final and hence they could not afford to release him,&quot; said Mpashi moaning: &quot;It is actually dishonesty on our Arab partners that we have to face such problems in getting our players for international duties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We actually got the order last week from FIFA, asking us to stop any dealings with John Fashanu concerning the transfer of players. And we are yet to send FIFA a feedback on the issue,&quot; said a FAZ insider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But FAZ general secretary, Hermann Mpashi, when approached could neither confirm nor deny the allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot as at now say if we have got the information or not, but the best I can say is that come tomorrow (today) for a press conference,&quot; said Mpashi who is expected to release the contents of the FIFA fax message this afternoon at his Anchor House offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But FAZ treasurer Musa Kasonka, who insisted only Mpashi could give full details, explained that FAZ had no deal with the Nigerian-born Fashanu on the transfer of players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only person who can talk on that is Mpashi but what you must understand is that Fashanu is only our agent as far as arranging international friendly matches and also looking for sponsors of our national team, he has never been our soccer agent,&quot; insisted Kasonka in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FIFA move to stop Fashanu selling Zambian players comes only two weeks after the Dennis Lota Commission of Inquiry, headed by Tom Mtine recommended that Fashanu must not be involved in the transfer of players.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Presideint Frederick Chiluba yesterday complained that the national sovereignty of African states will always be compromised due to dependence on donor aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the official opening of the Rotary 9 th District Conference at Lusaka's Mulungushi international Conference Centre yesterday, President Chiluba said Africa as a Continent cannot continue to rely on charity and indeed aid because however benevolent the donors may be, conditions will always compromise the recipients.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;National sovereignty and independence of action will always be compromised if we are seen as perpetual beggars and recipients of foreign aid. We should not be objects of charity but masters of our own destiny,&quot; President Chiluba said. &quot; We in the Third World are poor because we have allowed ourselves to be objects of charity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba's remarks come in the wake of the United States government's intentions to review the bilateral and multilateral relationship with Zambia, following the impasse that President Chiluba's controversial constitution has created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba further called for closer co-operation amongst Rotarians to alleviate poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Enough time has been wasted in ideological experiments,&quot; President Chiluba carped. &quot;We must break out of this vicious cycle if we, as a people, are to make an impact on the global economic scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And representative for president of Rotary International, Dr Edward Spiff from Nigeria, said Rotary was an idea deeply rooted in humanity and responding to personal needs immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Rotary is no longer just a fellowship,&quot; Spiff said. &quot;World peace will only be achieved if the members of Rotary worldwide come together.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - After decades of decline in wildlife populations, Africans are trying a different approach to conservation. The strategy -- involving community management and commercial use of wildlife -- is controversial, but Africans are making it work. This is the message that a delegation of Africans will deliver during a tour to Washington, DC, New York City, and Ottawa, June 18-27, 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR></SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Africans -- experts in conservation and community development from Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe -- will explain how rural communities are reviving traditional techniques involving local management and comunity benefit from wild animals. The proceeds from tourism and animal products create incentives that help sustain both threatened animal species and impoverished human communities, by providing funds to construct schools or clinics, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seminar tour coincides with a march on Capitol Hill by animal rights activists who oppose this African strategy. Many Americans who care about animals do not realize how much African communities sacrifice in terms of lost crops, water sources, and human lives in order to share their land with wildlife. The Africans are seeking opportunities to provide balance to the debate about African wildlife by explaining their indigenous approach to resolving human/animal conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the Africans will explain the need for U.S. policy regulating foreign species to be developed in consultation with the countries in which the species exist. Many species listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, for example, occur in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long-term success of the African strategy for sustaining wildlife depends on access to international markets for wildlife products such as ivory. Sustaining a demand for products within Africa requires a global understanding of how regulated trade benefits both the conservation of wildlife and the development of human communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African strategies will be discussed at seminars June 18 and June 21 in Washington, June 25 in New York City, and June 27 in Ottawa. Seminar hosts include the World Resources Institute, the World Bank, the World Wildlife Fund, the Forum of African Voluntary Development Organizations, The UN Development Programme, the International Conservation Union, and the Canadian Wildlife Federation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">TheWeek (Lagos) June 7, 1996 by Emmanuel Ado</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">907 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - When last month, Habib Yakubu, executive chairman, Kaduna State Board of Internal Revenue, vowed to surpass the target of N1,205,709,330, set for the board by the government this year, not many people took him serious.  Not even the fact that in 1995, he was able to increase internally generated revenue from a mere N200 million in 1994 to N793,266.699.38 could impress cynics, who insist that the target of one billion is rather over-ambitious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even before he outlined his strategy, traders of the Kaduna central market and other interest groups, notably the rich in Kaduna, were up in arms against the board. Their major argument was that government could not justify the collection of taxes in view of its failure to provide social social services. The government has, however, deflated the argument with a swift rehabilitation of roads in Kaduna and the provisions of potable water.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reportedly leading the opposition against the state government is Sunday Danladi Okogwu, brother-in-law of former president Ibrahim Babangida. He is alleged to have described Kaduna State tax policies as colonial and oppressive. Okogwu's position has expectedly pitched him against the state government. Sources told Theweek that Lawal Jaafaru Isa, Kaduna State administrator, was furious when he was briefed about Okogwu's indebtedness to the state government, through alleged false declaration of his income in the last six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between Isa and Okogwu there is no love lost. Late last year Okogwu reportedly slighted Isa by presenting him with a gold watch in public. Though Isa returned the watch, he has not forgotten the public embarrassment. But Government House sources insist that Okogwu's travails in the hands of the revenue board has nothing to do with the watch episode. Theweek reliably gathered that government picked on him as a scapegoat, a reward for his being the most outspoken critic of the internal revenue board's activities. The thinking is that he might be part of a concerted effort by tax evaders to instigate the people against the government. For the government, panic set in when traders at the central market threatened to close shops unless the government reduced taxes. In reality, the state government has not increased taxes, it has only blocked leakages and become more aggressive towards revenue collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unknown to the Okogwu is the fact that the government had since last year resolved to drag suspected tax dodgers before the Miscellaneous Offenses Tribunal. Shehu Idris, the emir of Zaria, strengthened governments resolve by paying N1 million as personal income tax. An elated Isa in a letter to Idris commended him for being &quot;the only one to pay N1 million as personal income tax despite the existence of more wealthy individuals in the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the emir's gesture, the government's response to the stiff opposition of Kaduna's rich men was swift. First, it caused a list of tax evaders to be published. The list could pass for a who-is-who in Nigeria.  Second, the government contracted an accounting firm to produce a register of all taxable entities in the state. The government hopes to increase its monthly revenue from N30 million to N70 million by the end of the exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case between Okogwu and the Board of Internal Revenue will to a large extent determine whether the Kaduna State government would be able to recover the over N600 million being owed it by its wealthy subjects. Already the board has written Okogwu, asking him to voluntarily provide details of his business activities in Nigeria and abroad, including certified final accounts of his businesses. He was further advised to appoint a &quot;competent tax consultant who will liaise between you and the tax authorities at the federal, state and local government levels including appeals against assessment.&quot; Okogwu's case might be a bad one, going by Yakubu's statement that Okogwu made false declaration to the board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Yakubu, the war against the rich can be justified on two grounds: the rich complain most about lack of social services; while only a fraction of them pay tax, meaning that it is public servants that bear the tax burden. It was learnt that between January and November, last year, the government realised N102 million through pay-as-you earn while it realised a paltry N3.9 million through direct assessment of self employed people. Worse, companies hardly pay to the state government deductions from staff salaries.  One company is said to be owing the government N32 million, being deductions for six years. Can the government prove its case against the rich men of Kaduna? The answer is a resounding yes, going by the report of a special tax audit committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - A Port Harcourt-based contracting firm tackles Shell Petroleum Company for allegedly failing to abide by the terms of a contract over a boat detained by the Nigerian Navy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are not the best of times for Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria. Worried by a seeming refusal to pay agreed damages for a detained barge hired from Samesokey Company Nigeria Limited by Willbros (WA) Incorporated for Shell Petroleum, a N48 million suit has been slammed on the multi-national oil company by Manfred Sappy, chief executive of Samesokey Company. Only last two weeks, a Port Harcourt High Court presided over by T.K. Osu had ordered the general manager (East), Shell Petroleum and the Rivers State Commissioner of Police to produce H.S. Al-Lamki, an expatriate staff of Shell or risk being jailed for contempt of court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sledge-hammer is also hanging over Adams Okoene and C. Henderson, engineering and human resources managers respectively of the oil giant. The duo were joined in the suit as co-defendants for their role in negotiating for an out-of-court settlement which failed. Al-Lamki had promised to prevail on Shell to pay the contractors for the period of detention of the barge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek investigation revealed that N48 million is being demanded by Samesokey as total loss, damages and inconveniences incurred during the period of seizure of &quot;African Oil Barge,&quot; a self-propelled boat belonging to the company on lease to Will bros (WA) Incorporated, contractor to Shell Petroleum. The contract history dates back to January 25, 1994, when a major oil leakage occurred at Nembe Creek IV Manifold. Willbros was mobilised by Shell to carry out repair works on the site and the Samesokey barge was used to evacuate sludge (mixture of crude oil and mud) to Nember Creek I flow station. The sludge could not be evacuated into the Nembe Creek. It was subsequently diverted to the Bonny Terminal Sludge Pit C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business went awry for Willbros when the self-propelled boat was arrested by Owems, a sub-lieutenant with the Nigerian Navy, NNS Okemini, on February 18, 1994. The company was accused of carrying petroleum products along the sensitive Bonny Terminal without proper documentation and authorisation. All attempts to release the boat failed as the Nigerian Customs Service subsequently impounded the boat for &quot;a suspected case of illegal dealing in petroleum product.&quot; This was contained in a letter addressed to Shell Petroleum dated August 15, 1994 and signed by J.O Alobo, an assistant legal adviser for the Nigerian Customs Service, Area I, Port Harcourt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another letter dated June 20, 1994, J.A. Kalu-Igboa, a commander in the Nigerian Navy, NNS Okemini, Port Harcourt, warned Shell Petroleum and its contractors that &quot;no petroleum products, no matter how little or how degraded, can be moved between points without prior approval from this Base which is the sole representative of the Task Force in this locality.&quot; After many weeks of seizure, the barge was release having attracted penalties from he two regulating bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acknowledging the seizure and recommending full compensation to the contractor for losses and inconveniences, I.O Ahize of the legal department of Shell Petroleum in an internal memo to Shell management (ECPE Department) dated October 20, 1994, noted: &quot;The absence of relevant documents coupled with Bonny being a major crude oil terminal/ocean port would have raised the suspicions of the authorities, thus leading to arrest and detention of the barge..&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahize recommended full payment to the contractor, Willbros, who, in turn, would settle Samesokey. But this did not go down well with Shell management. For many months the oil company refused to pay the contractor.  Snappy told Theweek in an interview that &quot;after several weeks of negotiations, the managing director of Willbros met with Shell management and they agreed to pay me my money covering the period of detention of my boat.&quot; Manfred was disillusioned when the promise to pay was not honoured. He went to court and sued Shell for N48 million in damages in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After several weeks of protracted court hearings, Sappy was advised by some top management staff of Shell to withdraw the case for an out-of-court settlement negotiated by Adams Okoene, Sappy went into a closed-door meeting with Okoene, Al-Lamki, and Henderson. The two parties (representing their companies) agreed that Shell would pay on the condition that the suit be withdrawn from the court by the plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True to the terms of the mutual agreement, Sappy proceeded to the court with his lawyers and formally withdrew the case on September13, 1995. But Shell allegedly refused to pay. The lawyers of Shell refused to comment on the matter when Theweek visited the legal department. One of the lawyers who pleaded anonymity, told Theweek that &quot;facts are sacred and the courts will determine the case.&quot; The battle-line seems to have been drawn.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alimany Sankoh, erstwhile spokesman of Sierra Leone's Rebel United Front, who abandoned the rebellion last January, tells Theweek why the war in the West African country may not end soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek: What motivated you to join the RUF? Sankoh: At first we were opposed to the war completely since its inception, we of the People's Democratic league even called for cessation of hostilities and negotiations to return the country to normalcy even when the military took over. But it came to a time when we received reports that foreign troops and mercenaries were being recruited to fight on behalf of the Freetown government and they were using banned weapons against the people of Sierra Leone, so we in PDL, entered on the side of the RUF in defence of our land and our civil population in the country. The rebels are Sierra Leoneans and every Sierra Leone'an life is equal to us. We cannot afford to sit down and watch mercenaries being deployed to destroy our people. We have to rise and fight to defend them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What was it like working with Foday Sanko?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was like working with former Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. Foday Sankoh believes that power lies in the barrel of the gun, so the only way he can become president of Sierra Leone is through the gun. He has vowed since the inception of the war not to talk peace or respect peace until his mission is accomplished. outrightly, he is a dictator. he doesn't allow others' opinion.  Whosoever challenges his views faces death. He is a demi-god to his supporters. Working with him was always a master-servant relationship. he believes that everybody should bow down before him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why and How did you escape to Ivory Coast?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I was the political and foreign relations official for the RUF. So I was in Abidjan trying to inform the world about the situation in Sierra Leone.  There, I met a friend of NPFL's Charles Taylor, Addae Sebo, a Ghanaian exile in London, who is also a freelance journalist, writing for NPFL. He came to me and requested that he wanted to go into RUF territory to cover stories for publication in newspapers and magazines. At the time, some expatriates were captured and were in the RUF camp. We needed publicity to tell the world our side of the story. So I sent Sebo to the camp to cover the story against the wishes of most of the other RUF officials. Sebo's claim to represent International Alert (NGO) embarrassed Sankoh and even the white captives that were there, because the only NGO Foday Sankoh approved then was the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Sebo went in, we had already handed over seven nuns captured by us, to the Roman Catholic Bishop in Mukeni, western Sierra Leone. We had also made it clear that the remaining ten foreign captives would be handed over to the Red Cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I then sent another communication to Foday Sankoh that the captives were to start making the journey from Foday Sankoh's headquarters to the Guinean border, on foot. When they reached the border towns, the RUF secretary for agriculture, who was Fajiah Musa, now deputy PRO, aligned with Addae Sebo. On the day of the handing over, Foday Sankoh radioed me that I should announce that the foreign nationals had been handed over to the Red Cross. So I called the BBC and announced that we had handed them over on humanitarian grounds without collecting ransom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On hearing my interview with the BBC, Addae Sebo radioed Foday Sankoh saying I was trying to overthrow Foday. That was the beginning of the problem. When I learnt of a plot by Foday Sankoh and his boys to kill me, I decided to return, and not to go into the RUF camp anymore. So I called a meeting and about 319 of my boys in the RUF escaped to Guinea from the camp.  On 31st of January 1996, we parted ways with the RUF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who are the main Supporters of the RUF?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I was there, there was no country supporting RUF. But before my PDL aligned with them it was Charles Taylor who was providing arms and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do they get their supply of arms, ammunition and food?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through ambushes, and sale of diamond to the business people in Guinea, they are able to get ammunition. For food, they have farms and they capture some from anywhere. There is a lot of yam, banana, plantain etc. in the bush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now in Ghana, what are you up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have now organised ourselves into the PDL to champion the course of peace and true democratic movement in Sierra Leone. It was the PDL that had stated the need for peace since 1991. We are still capable of bringing all the warring parties to accept peace. We don't want the Somalian or Liberian experience to be a replica in our country. We encourage only genuine peace brokers to be involved, not those who are out to just make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The present parliament in Sierra Leone is not democratic. It does not represent the entire Sierra Leone. Constitutionally, it should have 112 members but now it has only 68. So what happens to the other constituencies?  Are they not part of Sierra Leone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Do you see this war coming to an end soon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No! The involvement of the mercenaries show that the war will last for more years to come. Because South African mercenaries are receiving half a million dollars every month from the government salaries. And they have been given the whole of Komo district to mine diamond free. Only to kill Sierra Leoneans in their own land. Indirectly, our sovereignty has been handed over to them by the Freetown government. So these people will prolong the war for its economic ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the Nigerian and Guinean soldiers they will like the war to continue so that they can loot and take booties to their countries, such as cars, diamonds, electronics. International Alert is also there working to prolong the war. They are a Mafia group who are being used against African people. They were party to the Rwanda genocide, Burundi and Liberia. They are now in Sierra Leone to continue their exploits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the minister of foreign affairs in Kabbe's government is an anti-peace element. While he was working as adviser to Samuel Doe in Liberia, he advised Doe not to talk peace, but to continue to fight these foreign mercenaries in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN also is not doing enough for the peace process in Sierra Leone.  It is a shame that the UN is afraid to condemn the presence of the foreign mercenaries and troops in Sierra Leone. Last November, the UN organised a donor conference in New York to solicit for funds for the election in Sierra Leone, but up till now no conference on peace in Sierra Leone has been held by the UN. And it has failed to give protection to Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The policy of silence pursued by the British government towards the conflict in sierra Leone is disappointing and frustrating. They have done nothing to help the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do you prescribe for peace in Sierra Leone?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only way peace can come is that all foreign troops and mercenaries must leave and be replaced by the UN monitoring group or peace keeping force.  And the international community should help all the genuine Sierra Leonean groups fighting for peace in Sierra Leone. That International Alert and other foreign peace brokers who are just out to make money must leave. South African mercenaries have planted about five million mines in the soil of four million people and no country has ever come out to challenge or question their activities in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How do you fund your PDL?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through voluntary contributions. Presently, the Canadian government has allocated 3 million-dollars to help the democratic process in Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Gambia. Since the PDL believes in democracy, and we intend to get power through the democratic process, we have applied to the Commonwealth to give us our own share of the allocation, since it is for all democratic groups in these countries. It is not for the government alone. We, the PDL, has a clear manifesto. No other political group, not even the SLPP has. And the last election in Sierra Leone was greatly supported by the PDL. We hope that justice will prevail in the allocation of the funds so that all of us will get our share.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The Abacha war on corruption turns full circle to focus the searchlight on the cabinet. Those in the first line of fire are the presidents own cronies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Jeremiah Useni, minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, it was relationship as usual as he sought to table the request of his cabinet colleagues before Sani Abacha, the head of state. Earlier at an informal discussion among some of the ministers, Useni had been unanimously chosen, apparently because of his cozy association with the boss, as the right man to go and lobby the head of state to release the capital grants for the second quarter of the year early enough so that the ministries could execute their projects on schedule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now before Abacha, Useni got far less than he was accustomed to. Instead of the head of state attending to his request personally as was the case in the past, he told the FCT minister to direct his inquiry to Anthony Ani, Useni's colleague in the finance ministry, as he was the appropriate officer to handle such matters. Useni hobbled over to the finance ministry where a greater shock awaited him. As soon as he got into the finance minister's office, Ani greeted him with, &quot;Ah! thank God you're here, I have been meaning to get across to you.&quot; He told Useni that he was under a presidential instruction to write a memo to him to account for all the monies released to the FCT for capital projects in the last quarter, as well as, for the transfer of some ministries from Lagos to Abuja. Could he please oblige?  Useni was aghast, particularly at the bit about the transfer money which Theweek learnt was just a mere N1.5 million. He scuttled back to Abacha where his confusion was to be compounded further. When he inquired of the head of state whether it was indeed true that he had ordered Ani to write to him to render the accounts of the FCT, Abacha was generally vague. He said he could not now recollect whether he had given such an instruction, but then he added rather ominously, &quot;what is wrong in asking you to account for the monies you have received?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It dawned on Useni that this was more or less a confirmation of what he had heard earlier. Before the fateful encounter between him and the head of state, Theweek learnt that certain directors in the ministry had petitioned Abacha, alleging, among other things, that the FCT minister was diverting funds meant for the federal capital to the development of Langtang, his home base. Somehow, the minister got hold of the petition and decided on a course of reprisals against the petitioners. The outcome was a retrenchment of all those connected with the petition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this was said to have filtered through to Abacha was greatly displeased by the action of his crony and subordinate. Following this development, sources say, the head of state held a meeting with close confidants in the government on how to deal with the FCT minister and some of his colleagues who may have infringed the financial guidelines in this year's budget for executing capital projects. It is believed that it was part of the decisions at that meeting that led to the presidential instruction to the finance minister to ensure that the ministers account for the capital projects funds they had received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their second encounter, the head of state was in turn jolted by the FCT minister. Useni was said to have told him that he believed that Abacha gave specific instructions to Ani to query him based on what he had heard before now. He related in detail the high-level meeting at which the decision might have been taken. His information was so accurate that the head of state became convinced that someone who was privy to the discussions must have squealed. As soon as Useni departed, Abacha ordered a discrete inquiry to know the source of the leak. Sources say he was utterly amazed to learn that all indications pointed to M. Jubrin, a lieutenant-colonel and his aide-de-camp, as the mole. Abacha was furious. His immediate reaction, according to sources, was to retire Jubrin from the army. But after series of appeals to reconsider the issue based on the ADC's past services, he relented. As a source put it, Jubrin was not only removed as ADC to the head of state, he was &quot;banished&quot; to Pakistan as defense attachi to the Nigerian embassy there, to be replaced by one Aminu, a major.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former ADC was apparently caught in the web of dual loyalty. Sources say that if indeed he was the mole, he would have found it pretty difficult to keep what he overhead about Useni to himself. Useni is said not only to have helped Jubin to own a house in the federal capital territory, he has all along acted as his godfather in the military, rendering every kind of assistance to him. On the other hand, the former ADC was so enamoured of Abacha that he is believed to have been penciled down as the next military administrator of Kano State by the head of state. As it turned out, he unwittingly became the first casualty of Abacha's desire to turn the searchlight of accountability inward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information available to Theweek suggests that the administration's anti-corruption crusade was the brainchild of the presidential Economic Intelligence Monitoring United headed by Sam Aluko, a retired professor of economics and social critic. Quite early in the life of the administration, the unit was said to have suggested the rather novel idea of using special tribunals to fight corruption to achieve multiple goals - both political and economic. The unit is reputed to have recommended for special tribunals on failed banks, failed contracts, and failed parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's argument was that a crackdown on corruption at this point was such a popular measure that would appeal instantly to the broad masses of Nigerians and thus help to garner immeasurable political support for the administration. At another level, the unit argued that if the crusade was prosecuted to the letter, it would yield a bounteous harvest for individuals and the treasury to such an extent that such unexpected funds could help kick-start the prostrate economy. As a sop to all this, the unit said that whatever the government did to stir the economy would be in vain until there was a return to some form of probity and financial sanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed that it is these powerful arguments that swayed Abacha from previously chosen course not to exhume the past. Still, the head of state decided to play it cautiously. While the economic intelligence unit recommended that the war should begin with a band and simultaneously on all fronts, Abacha preferred to make a probing foray with the special tribunal on failed banks. The success of it, both at the political and economic level, was said to have astonished the head of state himself. Ordinary Nigerians did not only embrace the war, they seem to love the discomfiture of the high and mighty who are generally seen as those who have pillaged the economy. For the first time, the administration seemed to have hit on a weapon not only to guarantee it public support in the face of domestic and international opposition, but one that was re-directing the public's attention from the lingering political crisis to economic issues of financial sanity, and accountability. It is this success that has presumably encouraged the administration to venture afield into trying to set up tribunals on failed contracts and parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the same, the economic intelligence unit has long before now pointed to an area capable of undermining public support for the crusade - accountability in the government itself. In the unit's reasoning, if the war of probity was not extended to the cabinet, it would erode the confidence, and by extension the support, of the public. It was the unit that was said to have drawn up the guidelines on capital projects on expenditure that were incorporated in the 1996 budget. Theweek learnt that at the high-level meeting on Useni and his colleagues, a member of the unit who was present argued for the strict enforcement of the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was confirmed by last week that the ministries of national planning and finance have swung into action. Some ministers who went to solicit the release of the capital votes for their ministries this quarter were turned back. They were told that the votes would not be released until they had obtained from the military of National Planning certificates of compliance with the financial guidelines for their previous expenditures. To make the message sink, those ministries that have obtained clearance certificates have been rewarded with allocations to the tune of some N25 billion, while withholding abut N23 billion naira due to the defaulting ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek learnt that some ministries might find it difficult to scale the clearance hurdle. To issue a clearance certificate, officials of the national planning ministry are expected to conduct a physical inspection of projects and to certify that they had been undertaken according to specifications.  Sources at the ministry said last week that such a tour conducted recently by its officials revealed that some of the defaulting ministries and agencies acted clearly in breach of the financial procedures. Their default ranged from outright misappropriation through improper use of funds to what former vice president Augustus Aikhomu would call misapplication of funds. It is suspected that Useni's ministry of the federal capital territory and the Ministry of Works and Housing under Abdul Kareem Adisa may be among the distressed ministries caught in the clearance web.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha seems to have picked on Useni deliberately to start the war for inner cleansing; to send a powerful signal to his cabinet that the searchlight would not discriminate in those it beams upon. Says a source close to Aso Rock: &quot;The head of state is sending a signal to his ministers and Nigerians that this thing has nothing to do with friendship or cronyism.  It is a way of bolstering public confidence in what he's doing. No good general will go to war with his flanks wide open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed that the inner cleansing would be counter-productive in the long run. Sources say that the strategy of the administration is to drop erring ministers who after a deadline fail to pass the test of financial prudence being administered by the national planning ministry. it is even said that the administration is planning that ministers with serious cases of misappropriation of funds may have to stand trial. By press time, it was unclear whether such cases would have to go to the now famous special tribunals for failed chief executives of government departments. In official circles in Abuja, insinuation was that Useni's recent inspection of projects in federal capital territory was a kind of valedictory tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving the closeness of the head of state and the FCT minister, his exit from the cabinet is by no means certain. What seems clear, however, is that the Abacha administration may soon undertake the long speculated cabinet change. Insiders say the change will be wide-ranging and may not necessarily have to do with probity alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of those likely to be dropped is Uba Ahmed, the controversial labour and productivity minister. In Abacha's court, Ahmed's cup appears not only to be full, but overflowing. Despite the gale of controversy that had dogged his every action, Ahmed seems to have reached the last post only lately. The immediate cause of his worry was the conference &quot;labour and transition&quot; organised by the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, in Kaduna, May 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to abort the conference, the minister sent a report to the presidency claiming that the labour leaders were going to use the seminar to discredit the administration's transition programme. What irked the presidency most was that Ja'afaru Isa, the military administrator, was part of the conference. He was queried. At any rate, when the conference held, the communiqui was a fulsome endorsement of the political programme. The presidency was, therefore, as perplexed as Isa was angry at what he was as Ahmed's perfidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even so, the minister was not through yet. A day after the conference, he reportedly instigated security agents to arrest Adams Oshionmole, a labour leader and one of the principal architects of the pro-government seminar. Isa became even angrier when upon inquiry, he was informed that the order for Oshionmole's arrest did not come &quot;from above&quot; but was masterminded by the labour minister. Isa's was not the only sensitive corn that Ahmed stepped upon. He equally got Mohammed Wase, the administrator of Kano, who is a close friend of Oshionmole, very angry. According to sources, Wase's effort to get the labour leader released displeased Ahmed who decided to act. he was said to have mobilised eminent persons to go and complain to the administrator's father who is the emir of Wase. Ahmed's charge was the action of the emir's son was capable of jeopardising his ministerial job. Ahmed who is believed to be in the same age bracket with the administrator's father has lived almost all his life in Jos, and has been quite close to the emir. The administrator who saw Ahmed as exploiting his relationship with the emir was livid. As he saw it, the minister had gone too far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between them, the two administrators are said to have been making numerous contacts to get the presidency to drop Ahmed from the cabinet. The pair need not to have worried themselves over Ahmed's continued tenure as minister. Even before the Oshinmole episode, Aso Rock had become suspicious about the agenda of the labour minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matters came to a head in April when the minister unilaterally fired Usman Jalingo as the sole administrator of the National Union of Petroleum Energy and Gas, NUPENG, workers. When he wrote a letter sometime last year asking for approval from the government to sack Jalingo, he was turned down.  When he persisted in arguing for the need to remove the NUPENG administrator, the government resorted to dilatory tactics in the hope that the matter would die naturally. He was asked to discuss it with Ahmed Gusau, the sole administrator of the NLC, and report back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was all Ahmed needed. Although it was far from clear whether he discussed the matter with Gusau and the outcome of that discussion, the minister proceeded with Jalingo's sack apparently without reference again to the government. Jalingo's reaction became an embarrassment to all sides. He refused to quit for Ali Ciroma, the minister's nominee for the NUPENG job.  When Jalingo adamantly refused to hand over to his successor, the minister had to order his arrest, a situation that heightened the embarrassment for the government. The presidency was said to have been displeased with what it regarded as the shabby treatment of Jalingo. In its view, Jalingo should have been treated more decently if only for the fact that he came to NUPENG at a critical time and managed to restore normalcy to the restive oil workers union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At about the same time, Ahmed was engaged in series of battles on other fronts. One of his war sectors was the union members themselves with whom he had been waging a running battle over the merger of their unions. A typical case, illustrative of the minister's alleged penchant for manipulation, was the merger of four unions to form the Steel and Engineering Workers Union of Nigeria, SEWUN. The federating unions were those of Iron and Steel Worker; and Dockyard Workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of Ahmed's alleged meddling to ensure that Bilyaminu Rimi, supposedly a close associate of the labour minister, got elected as president of the new union, the close aaociate of the labour minister, got elected as president of the new union, the merger exercise had to be postponed three times - on March 8 and 18, and again on April 11. The first postponement resulted from the purported inability of the minister to attend the merger conference. On the second occasion, Gusau, the NLC administrator said he was not given money to host it. The third time, no reason was given. After the first two postponements, some of the union members were compelled to petition the minister, march 22, alleging government's attempt to impose Rimi on them.  Said the petitioners: &quot;It is clear that the government is very much interested in seeing Comrade Rimi, the president of the former Iron and Steel Workers Union of Nigeria ISWUN, becoming the president of SEWUN, thereby intimidating the other presidents and other financial members that are more qualified from contesting. &quot;Pleading to be left alone to elect leaders of their choice, the unionist raised an alarm that &quot;instructions have been given to the security agents to arrest and detain every member/officer opposed to his (Rimi's) candidature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was the very charge that Salihu Mohammed laid at Ahmed's door when he resigned in a huff. The personal assistant to the minister accused his former boss of planning &quot;mass arrests of unionists and to pitch the government against labour.&quot; What seems to rile the presidency was that in kicking off these controversies, starting with the sacking of Ason Bur as NLC's sole administrator last year, the minister is not acting to implement government's agenda. The suspicion in Aso Rock is that he is merely creating an enabling environment for his own candidate from Kano State to emerge as NLC's president in furtherance of his own future political activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who see the issue in that light easily point to the manner he apparently tried to demonize Oshiomole, and thereafter getting him arrested after failing in that subterfuge. For one thing, Oshiomole because of his pro-Abacha activities, has virtually been the government-anointed candidate for the NLC's presidency even before the dissolution of Paschal Bafyau's executive in 1994. For another, his showing at the Kaduna labour conference where he played a visible role in ensuring that the communiqui adopted a pro-government position should have been enough proof of his establishment credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the minister was summoned to Aso Rock in April amid the swirling problems in the labour sector, the speculation was that he was about to be fired. Theweek obtained different accounts of what transpired. One account says that Ahmed, convinced that he would be sacked, offered to resign. His request to be allowed to go was rejected by the head of state who saw such a resignation as an indirect vote of no confidence on the administration.  Another has it that Abacha was in fact dissuaded from sacking him, along with Gusau,, by lobbyists. Those who advised against the sack were said to have pressured the head of state to exercise patience until he was ready to change his cabinet. As for Gusau, the NLC sole administrator, the restraining hand was that he should be allowed to complete the merger of the industrial unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources told Theweek that Abacha was exasperated with Ahmed for tow main reasons. He and Gusau are said to have been unable to account for the votes given to the labour ministry and the NLC, just like some of their colleagues in other government departments. Again, the pair were equally unable to refute the widespread allegations of causing disaffection in the ranks of labour without promoting government interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahmed is not alone in his predicament. The long-awaited cabinet shake-up is said to be taking the head of state such an unusually long time because of the need to change many of its members who are now believed to have turned into liabilities rather than assets. One of those that might be dropped is Wole Oyelese, a special duties minister. he came into garrulous visibility last year when he noisily fired Mohammed Saleh, the acting Director-General of the Centre for Democratic Studies, Abuja, on January 17 and set up a panel headed by Catherine Okon to probe the institution. In quick response, Gidado Idris, the secretary to the federal government, countermanded the minister.  He quashed Saleh's suspension, disbanded the probe panel and withdrew its members back to the presidency where Oyelese had apparently pinched them without proper authorisation. As if to empahsise the disdain with which he held the minister's action, Idris left the signing of the letter to a subordinate, S.K. Okpara, a director-general in the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, the minister, huffing and puffing, bristled: &quot;I do not take orders from the SFG because I am responsible to him. I am only responsible to the head of state and accountable to the people of this country.&quot; Saying that &quot;my ministry is not under the SFG,&quot; Oyelese boasted that, &quot;Saleh remains suspended until the terms of reference of the probe panel are resolved and its recommendations passed to the federal government for final resolution.&quot; It was almost comical. As the minister was blowing this hot air, the panel members were already back to the presidency where the secretary wanted them. The presidency had to come to the rescue of the combatants with the face-saving policy of no victor, no vanquished by dissolving the CDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerians were to hear from Oyelese again during the local government elections in March. Working ostensibly to prevent opponents of the administration from participating in the elections, the special duties minister was everywhere in Oyo, his home state, meddling with the screening of candidates. In no time, he ran into a brickwall in the form of Omololu.  Because of Oyelese's unabashed interest in sponsoring a candidate for the chairmanship of his own Egbeda local government council, both government officials literally came to fistcuffs. Nothing could have undermined the transition programme - already the subject of intense suspicion both at home and abroad - more than this trading in insults and accusations. As David Attah, chief press secretary to the head of state described the feud, it was an &quot;embarrassment to the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oyelese's unabashed pursuit of his political self-interest was only symptomatic. His two other colleagues in the special duties train followed in his beaten path. In Imo State, Laz Unaogu strove to protect the interest of his political godfather, Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, publisher of the Champion group of newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the guise of stopping opponents of the government from coming to power many ministers allegedly used their paraphernalia of office to pursue their own political interest in varying degrees. Among those widely believed to have played politics with their office and thus casting a shroud of credibility over the entire transition programme included Muhammadu Gambo-Jimeta in Adamawa State and Tom Ikimi in Edo State. After the elections, the head of state was so unhappy with the politician-ministers that he swore to clear them from office before the next round of elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still it is not clear which of the criteria would weigh most in Abacha's decision on who stays and who goes. Said to be on top of the hierarchy of influencing factors is probity and accountability, to be followed by competence and the ability to stay out of controversies. If Abacha follows his score-card to the letter, ministers like Ikimi of external affairs; Walter Ofonagoro of information; Jim Nwobodo of Sports; and of course Oyelese, Unaogu and M.T.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now those seats seem impregnably safe are Ani, Abacha's collaborator on his many economic wars, and Dan Etete of petroleum resources - and perhaps, a few others.

His war on corruption, the rave of the moment. With Yusuph Olaniyonu, Amos Esele and Sani Yaro</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - In his usual frank manner, Anthony Aniagolu, former Supreme Court justice and chairman of the defunct Constituent Assembly, uses a public function to berate the corrupt Nigerian leadership and to call for a change of values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only the organisers know why they invited him. For ever since the annulment of the June 12,1993 presidential election and the subsequent discarding of the 1989 constitution which he toiled to write with his colleagues in the Constituent Assembly, Anthony Aniagolu, retired justice of the Supreme Court and chairman of the defunct Constituent Assembly, has never hidden his loss of faith in the Nigerian leadership and its brand of politics. Whenever he gets an opportunity to speak on the socio-economic and political problems of the country, he does not fail to rebuke both the military and the political class for the mess into which they have thrown the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Aniaglolu, one such opportunity came May 23 during the third general assembly of Nigerian People's Movement, held sat the Cinema Hall of the Hotel Presidential, Enugu. In his address as chairman of the occasion, the renowned jurist rained abuses and innuendo on the leaders of the country, leaving everyone in attendance with much food for thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his opening remarks, Aniagolu made it clear that he had &quot;no belief in the Nigerian brand of politics in which deceit and dishonesty appear to prevail.&quot; He said that he accepted to attend the event because &quot;I am committed to honesty, fair play and immutable justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aniagolu regaled his audience with the story of &quot;Lunaria,&quot; a plant fondly called honesty because of its round, translucent pods. The former Supreme Court justice said that Nigerian leaders are supposed to be like the translucent pods of Lunaria by being as exactly as they look outwardly. He stated that honesty is an essential ingredient of friendship and that for friendship to subsist among people, individuals or couples, there must be honesty. Honesty is equally necessary, according to him, between countries, between towns and villages, between ethnic groups and between God and man. He noted that honesty breeds peace and happiness as against dishonesty, which begets deceit, suspicion and confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aniagolu lamented that even though the Almighty God, by endowing the country with wealth and riches, has made it the number one nation in Africa, prolonged period of military rule has made the country to sink from the exalted position of giant of Africa to the pitiable level of one of the 22 poorest countries in the world. He regretted that under military, the economy of Nigeria has touched the rock bottom of degradation, its reputation as a nation has sunk to the lowest ebb ever while its currency cannot be quoted anywhere in the world. He submitted that under military rule, Nigeria cannot achieve much in terms of its economy, political prestige, the happiness of its people, spiritual emancipation, education advancement, international cooperation and a high level of gross national product. The country's saviour, he pointed out, lies in democracy, justice, equity and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aniagolu stressed that Nigeria must turn its back on the soldiers and face the legal draftsman for solace. He advised the military to lay down their &quot;political guns&quot; and take up their &quot;constitutional guns&quot; in defence of the territorial integrity of the nation and the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the politicians, the retired justice accused them of shortsightedness since they do not seem to see that their only trade is in jeopardy. He asked rhetorically whether they do not see that they are fast losing all credibility both with the military and with the rest of the people of Nigeria. &quot;Do they think that the people of Nigeria are so gullible that they can deceive them all the time?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ex-constituent Assembly chairman enjoined the politicians to leave the path of deceit, unjust enrichment, greed and avarice, lies, double dealings and double talk, chicanery, and stealing from the public treasury.  He advocated that they return to the road of honesty and to Almighty God. He offered the same suggestion to the military, whom he accused of &quot;having stolen the people's monies and vandalised their treasury.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Aniagolu, unless both the military and the civilian leaders change their attitude and values for the better, Nigeria can never be saved by what he called the corrupt dealings and criminal conglomerates that have afflicted her to this day. He wandered what it profits a politician who has made all the money and wealth for himself by looting the public treasury, only to end up as an object of ridicule before the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aniagolu is consoled by the fact that such politicians after making the money, are searched to the bones, &quot;quarantined&quot; and subjected to all sorts of indignities whenever they get to the international airports of many countries outside Nigeria, while ordinary folks from other countries are welcome without any fuses. In a fit of rage, the retired justice warned all the dubious and corrupt leaders in Nigeria to realise the folly of their evil ways or suffer, not only disgrace before man but also eternal damnation by God. He insisted that whether Nigerians were talking of solidarity of one ethnic group or the inter-relationship of different ethnic groups in the country, honesty should be allowed to link all the people together in peace and honesty. Aniagolu's conclusion: The time has come in the context of Nigerian affairs, when the people must take stock and ask themselves whether they shall continue to be weighed down by military dictatorship and civilian misrule.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Some thirty religious leaders gathered in New York in late May to pledge themselves to the task of restoring freedom and democracy in Nigiera. These leaders have appealed to their community to proclaim a &quot;Nigeria Freedom Sunday&quot; on October 3, 1996 to focus attention on the situation in Nigeria. Below Africa News Online has reprinted the full text of their declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Declaration of Conscience on Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We Ministers of Faith gathered at the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem, New York, on May 28, 1996 today declare our commitment to the restoration of freedom and democracy in Nigeria. Once a beacon of hope and pride for African peoples throughout the world, this African nation has been brought low by the brutality and injustice of a military dictatorship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian regime has stripped away the peoples' most basic human and civil rights, replacing them with violence, fear and intolerance. Many religious, political, trade union and community leaders have been unjustly imprisoned, forced into exile or murdered. The nation's hospitals and universities, once the pride of Africa, are in ruins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A democratic election was annulled in 1993 and the winner, Moshood Abiola, has been jailed for nearly two years. Multi- national corporations exploit Nigeria's vast human and mineral wealth, extracting billions of dollars in profits while Nigerian children go hungry. The Christian Association of Nigeria lamented last year that, &quot;Our hopes for amelioration have been dashed to pieces,&quot; and that the suffering of the people demands &quot;nothing short of divine intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call on all people of good will to mark the 36th anniversary of Nigerian independence as &quot;Nigerian Freedom Sunday,&quot; on October 3, 1996, a day of prayer for the victims of oppression and dictatorship and for the return of freedom and democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The following statement is from the International Roundtable on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Roundtable on Nigeria (IRTON) condemns the assassination of Mrs. Kudirat Abiola. Mrs. Abiola was shot along with her driver in an ambush in Lagos yesterday. She was rushed to the Eko Hospital but efforts to save her were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IRTON would like to offer its deepest sympathies to Chief M. K. O.  Abiola and the Abiola family. Mrs. Abiola's murder adds to the already too-heavy burdens of the family. Chief Abiola, the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party, saw his victory in free and fair elections in June 1993 annulled, and he has been incarcerated since June of 1994 for trying to claim his mandate. Mrs. Abiola's tireless efforts to have her husband released brought constant harassment from officials of the Abacha regime. In May, she was arrested and was to appear in court in June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increasing violence in Nigeria is the result of the breakdown of the rule of law in Nigeria. Responsibility for this breakdown and the crisis lies directly with the regime of General Sani Abacha. The recent spate of political attacks, which include the shooting of Alex Ibru, publisher of the Guardian, and the murder of Alfred Rewane, a key financial supporter of the Social Democratic Party, are alarming indicators of Nigeria's continuing slide into violence. Even as the Provisional Ruling Council claims to be presiding over a transition to democracy, the country's leading voices remain stifled in jail, leaders of the independent press have been detained or forced underground for trying to publicize the truth, and the judicial system remains handcuffed by decrees granting immunity to members of the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha regime must ensure that those responsible for this crime are brought to justice, and that justice must be open and meet international standards of due process. At the same time the persons responsible for the attacks on Alex Ibru, Alfred Rewane and all other human rights abuses must also be brought to account. This is the only way the rule of law will be re-established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IRTON calls upon the international community to put its rhetoric to practice and increase diplomatic and political pressure on the Nigerian government. Unless action is taken soon, Nigeria's descent into political violence will no longer be a question of if, but of when. The Clinton administration has referred to freezing the assets of members of the military junta, targeted sanctions on the oil industry, a cultural boycott and a boycott of Nigerian oil. We call upon the Clinton administration to implement an activist, preventative policy now, before the body count increases.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is a press release from the Association of Nigerians Abroad (ANA) on June 5, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Association of Nigerians Abroad (ANA) has learnt of the assassination of Mrs. Kudirat Abiola, the wife of the jailed winner of Nigeria's last presidential elections. Unless it is irrefutably ascertained otherwise, we in ANA are of the opinion that the military regime of General Sani Abacha bears complicity in this assassination a week away from June 12, the third anniversary of the annulled presidential elections which Kudirat's husband won. Indeed the dividing line between the so-called &quot;hoodlums&quot; and the Nigerian military has become increasingly thin by the day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several atrocities have been committed, and continue to be committed by the regime. Her assassination follows the pattern of the cold-blood assassinations of Chief Riwanu a 73 year old veteran politician in his residence and attempted assassination of Mr Alex Ibru an ex-Minister of Information and a newspaper publisher in February, still in hospital in London. Indeed this week's murder of Mrs Kudirat Abiola was preceded a week ago by the murder of two naval officers in Lagos, and the armed storming of Bauchi prison on the 31st of May, where Gani Fawehinmi the lawyer that defended Mr Ken Saro-Wiwa is held without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANA has said on numerous occasions that the current Nigerian military regime is a lawless and brutal regime used to pathological lying to buy credibility from gullible international and local organisations. That the regime has absolutely no regard for local and international laws has been repeatedly demonstrated before the world. The regime will go to any length to maintain it's reign of terror on the law abiding and resilient citizens of Nigeria, including the use of hired assassins to maim and kill it's citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The murder of author and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Nigerian political activists of the minority Ogoni ethnic group is still very fresh in our minds. At present, hundreds of Nigerians have been imprisoned by the regime, several without any charges or prosecutions. Within the last two weeks more labour unions, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) were proscribed, adding to the unending list of labour unions being proscribed and intimidated. Is it coincidental that these wanton and barbaric killings are taking place one week after the release of the report of the UN Fact-Finding Mission to Nigeria, it appears the junta has seen the report as a UN endorsement of its modus operandi - the oppression of the people, the denial of human rights, neglect for the rule of law and sanctity of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We again take this opportunity to call on the international community to take actions, including sanctions, that will help bring a rapid end to this brutal and tyrannical regime in Nigeria. We specifically request the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Imposition of mandatory oil embargo on Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * An immediate visa ban on all sporting contacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian regime and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Withdrawal of military attaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Cessation of military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Embargo on the export of arms to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Denial of educational facilities to members of the regime and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A downgrading of cultural links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Downgrading of diplomatic missions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Ban on airlinks with Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Freezing of the financial assets and bank accounts of military and government ministers in foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Unconditional release of all political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Initiation of dialogue with Mr Abiola the winner of the June 1993 presidential elections to form a government of national unity that will handle the transition program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also request the international community not to give any semblance of credibility whatsoever to the regime or any of it's activities. We refer here to the recent United Nations Human Rights probe reports which gave some credibility to the military junta's plans to restore democracy to Nigeria at the junta's pace. The international community must be consistent in its criticism and opposition of non-mandated Nigeria's military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian people will like to see an immediate end to the jailing, maiming, and killing of fellow Nigerians by it's government. Most Nigerians fully support the individuals and pro-democracy organisations attempting to correct the injustices in Nigeria. The support of the international community will go a long way in hastening the demise of this brutal regime.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The Nigerian Democratic Movement (NDM) issued the following information release on June 4, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We bring to your attention the extremely tragic news of Chief Kudirat Abiola's assassination today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a dastardly crime against a woman merely seeking the release of her dearly beloved husband from illegal detention. It represents a continuing Stalinization of Nigeria by a brutal military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that it has now become clear to all Nigeria watchers and apologists that the barbaric junta of Abacha must not be allowed to continue to run Nigeria and its people down for ONE MORE DAY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa - Rewane - Ibru: who next? Is this any environment for &quot;a political transition programme&quot; when the lives of ordinary and not-so-ordinary Nigerians are lost every day due to government-orchestrated violence ? We now ask the United Nations and Butros-Ghali: is this an environment demonstrating Abacha's &quot;commitment, statesmanship and sincerity&quot;, when the lives of Nigerians cannot be protected ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDM vows the removal of the Abacha regime by all means necessary, and calls upon all lovers of Nigeria to pledge same. We ask for all in the international community to match their words with action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the text of a press release from the National Democratic Coalition of Nigeria (NADECO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We received with great shock the news of the assassination of Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, wife of the detained winner of the 1993 Nigerian presidential election, Chief MKO Abiola. The world has become used to bad news from Nigeria but no one, in his or her wildest imagination, would have thought that the Nigerian regime would descend so low as to engineer the calculated cold blooded murder of an innocent and courageous wife whose husband they are holding in unjust detention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are aware of the many direct and indirect approaches, including threats, to try to get Kudirat Abiola to betray her husband by modifying her support of Chief Abiola's mandate. But Kudirat stood firm. Now, like the many fallen and yet unsung heroes of the Nigerian struggle, Kudirat has paid for principle and courage with her most precious possession - her life ! And with her death, the Abacha regime has finally sunk to the lowest depths of depravity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our appeal is to the international community. Ken Saro-Wiwa was murdered by this same regime. The world convulsed momentarily. Mrs. Kudirat Abiola must not be allowed to die in vain. Her death like many before hers was not the work of any hoodlums but the result of organized state terrorism. For long we have tried to convince the world that the Abacha regime is not interested in democracy but is carefully stringing the world along in the hope that, given the ponderous rate at which the world responds to crisis, he just might get away with his antics. Whilst the world is busy looking for evidence that the Abacha transition is genuine we have been trying to make them see that, transition or no transition, Nigeria is gradually sinking into anarchy and possible disintegration. The murder of Mrs Abiola can only further complicate and speed the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nadeco does not want anarchy; Nadeco does not want violence; Nadeco does not want Nigeria to disintegrate. The consequences of violence and ethnic hatred are all too clear in recent history, vide Bosnia and Rwanda to mention only two. But time is getting dangerously short. Unless the United States, the European Union and key African countries act soon, the world will be faced with the spectre of a nation of 100 million people in the process of bitter disintegration. This will result in refugee and humanitarian problems of horrendous proportions for which the long-suffering taxpayers of the western world have to foot the bill. Preventive action now can still avoid unnecessary human suffering and huge outlay by the western world on humanitarian aid and possible peace keeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian opposition has pursued the struggle in a responsible, non-violent manner. The world would be sending the wrong signals to the more radical Nigerian elements if effective action is not taken now. We have already pointed out that only oil sanctions, freezing of assets, and a ban on air and sporting links can bring the regime to its senses speedily. The world should help Nigeria effect peaceful change. Time is fast running out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The following is a statement from the National Liberation Council of Nigeria on June 5, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet another patriotic Nigerian has been killed for voicing an opinion that the illegal Nigerian regime did not want to hear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The junta will no doubt try to pin the murder of Kudirat Abiola on armed robbers, it is clear however that this planned assassination was the culmination of months of harrassment. The junta recently brought charges of 'false publication' against Kudirat. She was brought before the court, released and arrested again. She remained unrelenting in her vociferous campaign to obtain her husbands release and recognition of the June 12th mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Kudirat Abiola has been murdered, and Sani Abacha's fingerprints are all over her corpse. She joins Chief Alfred Rewane, Ken Saro-Wiwa and a host of others on Nigeria's ever lengthening roll-call of martyrs that indict the very existence of this regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nalicon has no doubt that the junta are responsible for the murder of this brave woman, and calls on Nigerians to act with restraint, but with undiminished resolve. The junta is itching to create a situation that will justify the imposition of a state of emergency under which other crimes against humanity will become even more routine. Let the nation remain vigilant but uncowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community must acknowledge the evidence before their eyes. This regime has neither the ability nor the intention to return the country to civilian rule. Those who speak out against the military junta risk their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Military dictators have been emboldened by the repeated failure of the international community to back their words with decisive action. This inaction has merely served to show the despots that they can kill their critics with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The time has come to stop trying to appease this criminal regime. Again we call on the free nations of this world to unite in bringing pressure to bear on this regime by imposing economic sanctions including an oil embargo, and freezing all known assets of the members of this regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call on the international community to be specific in their demands which must include the immediate release of all political prisoners including Moshood Abiola and an agreement to hand over the task of ushering in democracy to a civilian body immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A failure to act decisively now is likely to result in a spiralling violence and bloodshed within the country, with consequent destabilisation of the West African subregion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is a statement by John Shattuck, the U.S.  assistant secretary of state for democracy, during a briefing on Rwanda co-sponsored by the Congressional Human Rights Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus June 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chairmen, thank you for inviting me to meet with you today to discuss the International War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am particularly pleased to be able to brief you at this time, particularly in light of significant, breaking developments regarding the Tribunal, and coming, as it does so soon after my recent trip to (the) region with Rwanda/Burundi Coordinator Ambassador Richard Bogosian, which focused in large part on the Tribunal and on justice issues in Rwanda. This trip was part of the Administration's broad effort to bring peace and stability to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHY WE SUPPORT THE TRIBUNAL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States strongly supports the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in bringing to justice those individuals responsible for the genocide in Rwanda in which hundred of thousands of people were killed in 1994. We believe the Tribunal has a key role to play in promoting peaceful settlement of conflicts and long-term respect for human rights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: RESULT OF INTENSIVE EFFORT AND COOPERATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tribunal at Arusha, Tanzania, last week took important steps toward beginning the trials of those persons accused of the 1994 genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three persons, Georges Anderson Rutaganda, Jean Paul Akayesu, and Clement Kayishema appeared in court on May 30 and 31, had the charges read against them, and entered their pleas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These first appearances were the result of months of careful work by the Tribunal and growing cooperation by other countries, particularly by other African countries who have come to realize the Tribunal's value to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government of Zambia, after appeals from the Tribunal and the Government of Rwanda, arrested a number of suspects; they were subsequently indicted by the Tribunal and held in Zambia at the request of the Tribunal until being transferred to Arusha on May 26. A third, Clement Kayishema was arrested last month at the request of the Tribunal, and also held by Zambia until his transfer to Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten other suspects have been detained in Cameroon; four of these have been provisionally charged. These include Col. Theoneste Bagosora, suspected of being one of the chief architects of the genocide, and Ferdinand Nahimana, who directed Radio Mille Collines, the hate radio which exhorted the population to commit the killings. We hope to see these four transferred to Arusha in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, there are three suspects now being held in Belgium and another in Switzerland, all of whom will hopefully be transferred in coming weeks. Eight others have been indicted but not yet arrested, and are believed to be living in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States has actively encouraged the Tribunal to move forward expeditiously on indictments and transfers. When other countries have arrested suspects, we have stepped in to encourage their cooperation with the Tribunal and have at times served to pass messages in countries where communications are difficult. We have urged other countries, including Kenya and Zaire, where suspected war criminals are believed to reside, to be responsive to requests from the Tribunal to make arrests. Finally, we have successfully urged countries with competing claims to extradition, especially Rwanda, hundreds of thousands of whose citizens were murdered, and Belgium, ten of whose peacekeepers were brutally killed, to recognize the primacy of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in trying these war criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COOPERATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF RWANDA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On our recent trip, Ambassador Bogosian and I were particularly pleased to see the stepped-up cooperation between the Tribunal and the Government of Rwanda. Rwandan Government leaders acknowledged the benefit to Rwanda of having key figures in the genocide tried by the International Tribunal and we have urged them to continue their cooperation with the Tribunal. We believe this kind of cooperation can assist Rwanda in moving forward in its own efforts to bring to justice those accused of participating in the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SITUATION IN RWANDA:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The work of the Tribunal is closely tied to the justice situation in Rwanda. In the year since my last visit, the Rwandan justice system, which was decimated by the civil war and genocide, has progressed significantly.  The physical infrastructure is being rebuilt; judicial personnel are being trained; and the laws necessary to go forward with the prosecutions are now with the Parliament for consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. has contributed substantially to these programs, with $4.5 million in FY 95 and an anticipated $2.5 million in FY 96 for our Administration of Justice program which has contributed to training new magistrates, rebuilding of courtrooms, and advice on reform, and $1.2 million for our ICITAP program to assist in training the police. This, coupled with sustained diplomatic engagement demonstrates the positive results to be gotten through our assistance. The process is on track. In addition, we visited three prisons and emphasized to Rwandan authorities our concern about horrendous and continuing overcrowding. The Deputy Justice Minister described efforts under way to use U.S.-donated tents to expand prison space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. SUPPORT FOR THE TRIBUNAL:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. support for the Tribunal remains a key element of our Rwanda policy. Since the establishment of the International War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), we have been one of the Tribunal's most active supporters, not only politically, but financially and logistically as well. Beyond the regular 1994-95 U.N. budget assessment of $1,683,000, we have made voluntary contributions in the form of cash, personnel, goods, database development, and sharing of information at an estimated cost of $3,900,000. We hope to contribute an additional $500,000 this year for personnel. The U.N. budget for the Tribunal for this year is $40.1 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A substantial portion of our voluntary contributions are personnel, sub-contracted under the Department of Justice's ICITAP mechanism. Thus far, the U.S. has ten individuals sub-contracted to work for the Tribunal: three investigators, one interpreter, and six case managers. The U.S. has also sponsored the temporary assignment of two computer specialists to the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the U.S. was responsible for the establishment of a Rwanda Tribunal Documentation Center. Essentially, the Documentation Center, housing thousands of unclassified documents on war crimes suspects, will help provide the information necessary to ensure full and effective investigations and trials. This U.S.-sponsored project has gone toward the development of a database and provided for the hiring of six case-managers responsible for handling Tribunal investigators' requests for document information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lack of equipment and supplies has hampered Rwanda Tribunal investigations from the start. The Clinton Administration has attempted to fix these deficiencies with the purchase and delivery of thousands of dollars worth of equipment, most notably secure-communications equipment, microfilm printer-readers, photocopy machines, computers, and Polaroid cameras. Most recently, we sponsored a humanitarian airlift of excess Department of Defense equipment, including vehicles, forensic equipment, computers, and office furniture. Judge Goldstone has expressed deep appreciation for the timely delivery of these urgently needed items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MORE TO BE DONE:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Needless to say, and despite our contributions and those of other governments, there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The genocide in Rwanda was unique in the scale of involvement of ordinary citizens at the behest of their government, yet little was committed to paper, making it difficult to put together dossiers on individual suspects.  In his recent visit, Justice Goldstone reiterated a plea he had made earlier in Geneva for additional investigators and prosecutors. The U.S. will attempt to be responsive to his request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite these difficulties, the important first steps have now been taken at Arusha. As trials begin and the spotlight is shown on the Tribunal and the contribution it can make to accountability for this terrible genocide, the people of Rwanda can begin to move forward toward reconciliation and justice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Alfred Nzo, it has to be said, is not a man favoured by Lady Luck. On the day our foreign minister makes a grand gesture towards the ideal of consultation -- in the process conceding that our government has done a U-turn on Nigeria -- the wife of that country's imprisoned president-elect, Chief Abiola, is shot dead in Lagos. But, as many a gambler would be happy to advise Nzo, luck has to be earned. With that in mind we feel less than sympathetic towards the minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo's gesture towards consultation this week came in the form of a so-called &quot;Green Paper,&quot; offering his ministry's views on foreign policy as a basis for a national debate. While the initiative is to be welcomed, the<BR>discussion document is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It suggests that South Africa should adopt a &quot;leadership role ...  without politically antagonising the country's African partners&quot;. In apparent justification of this Nzo cites the difficulties he ran into with the Nigerian saga, when South Africa found itself the only African country breaking diplomatic ties over the Saro-Wiwa hangings and the only country on the continent calling for sanctions against the Abacha regime. As a result, according to the minister, we found ourselves breaching what he characterises as &quot;the norms of<BR>solidarity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The betrayal of principle inherent in this pusillanimous approach is self-evident. And the price to be paid for such betrayal was illustrated by the murder of Kudiratu Abiola. If we had stayed on course with our original approach to Nigeria we would be proud of our stand this week. As it is, we are once again wiping egg off our collective face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The word &quot;pride&quot; points to the difficulty under which Nzo may be labouring a<BR>misunderstanding of what foreign policy is about. It needs to be appreciated by the government that it is not expected to reform the world, or Africa, or, even Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela did us proud when he took the stand on principle which cost him much of his life in prison, but which finally broke the back of apartheid. The ANC's negotiators did us proud when they faced down the National Party on issues of principle and secured democratic rule. Now we want to make a<BR>contribution to the cause of humanity, to discharge our duties as members of the<BR>international community. And we want to take pride in that as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be fair to Nzo there are some aspects of our foreign policy in which we can take pride. Our support of Cuba comes to mind. But the reverse side of the coin is Libya. Can we really take pride in support of an<BR>authoritarian dictatorship which is probably busy developing a chemical weapons industry and which is certainly making a sizeable contribution to the politics of violence in various parts of the world, including Africa ?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The choices we face on the diplomatic front can be difficult. They will be that much more difficult if we sacrifice principle on the altar of solidarity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Corruption in state firms alone has been costing Kenya an average of $104,5-million annually, according a parliamentary probe, but chances are not much will be done with the investigators' findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a 672-page draft report, Kenya's Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) reveals that in six years the heads of the country's 56 state firms misappropriated 36,8-billion shillings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In hard currency terms, that's $627-million - -- more than the $508-million, which, according to the World Bank, Kenya received in official development assistance in 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The officials who committed the frauds were members of the ruling Kenya National African Union (Kanu), according to the draft. Thus, when the 11-member PAC issued it, state officials refused to release additional documents the committee needed to complete its investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to PAC Chairman Kijana Wamalwa, leader of the opposition Forum for the<BR>Restoration of Democracy, the officials have refused to provide critical information on audit queries and have stonewalled investigations by denying the PAC access to crucial sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition members of the PAC also say the committee's work has been hampered by the abusive application by the speaker of parliament of the sub judice rule. He argued that the issues were under judicial consideration and therefore were prohibited from public discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The very unco-operative attitude adopted by government officers shows that the state is afraid of an independent inquiry,&quot; Wamalwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those fingered by the report include Moi's private lawyer, Simeon Mauncho, whose two firms Yamco Limited and Nchoke Limited are accused of fraudulently obtaining the<BR>equivalent of $55 172 from the National Cereals and Produce Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another ally of the president, Kipng'eno arap Ng'eny, former chief executive of the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, is accused of charging the utility $1 431 003 in consultancy fees for an abandoned project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Time is running out for the PAC. Its deadline is June 11, by which date parliament expects the final report to be tabled. In desperation, the committee's five opposition members have written to President Daniel Arap Moi, seeking his intervention to force the release of the outstanding documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Wamalwa, attorney general Amos Wako, parliamentary speaker Francis ole Kaparo, Fares Kuindwa -- who heads the public service -- Joseph Sang, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Lands, and financial secretary Joseph Kinyua should be forced to provide the information the<BR>committee needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have taken the unusual step of seeking your excellency's intervention in view of the grave constitutional crisis that has been precipitated by your officers' and the speaker's conduct,&quot; the five PAC members explained in their letter at the end of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Moi dismissed the request as a &quot;political gimmick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our appeal to the president was in realisation that the presidency is the confluence of the three arms of government ... and that as the head of the executive, he could order officers to give the vital information required by the committee,&quot; Wamalwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, Kanu members of the PAC team criticised their colleagues' action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We condemn strongly this move which amounts to contempt of the laid down standing orders of parliament,&quot; said Kanu legislator George Ndotto.  &quot;According to order number 161, no evidence received by and no documents presented to a select committee shall be published or otherwise disclosed to any person other than a member of the house.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Relations between South Africa and the rest of the region are at their worst since the end of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When South African trade minister Alec Erwin visits Zimbabwe this week, he will be astonished at the level of anger which meets him over South African tariffs and subsidies which have left the region devastated by unfair trade practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's economy is 20 times bigger than Zimbabwe's, but prior to South Africa's inclusion in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Zimbabwe accounted for more than 50 percent of gross domestic product in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many businesspeople in the region feel South Africa should decide whether it belongs to the SADC or the South African Customs Union (Sacu), saying that membership of both allows South Africa to move the goalposts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Robertson, a leading economist in Zimbabwe, claims that South Africa is a victim of its own history. &quot;Sacu is very expensive for South Africa,&quot; he said. &quot;Customs duty payments are shared within Sacu, but these could never be extended to a country like Zimbabwe. It was a sort of political buying off of Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho during the apartheid years, the need for which has gone.&quot; He added that disbanding Sacu requires the assent of all members, making South Africa's position difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has imposed import tariffs of between 60 and 90% on many countries in the region -- and a deposit tariff of 125% on goods in transit.  The World Trade Organisation (WTO), which recommends tariffs of no more than 35%, has given South Africa a moratorium on bringing import duties down which lasts well into the next century. But elsewhere in the region, manufacturers argue South Africa's high import duties were deviously imposed just before South Africa joined the WTO. &quot;They may have done this so that they could negotiate down,&quot; said Robertson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dispute is further complicated by South African subsidies for manufactured exports, a measure brought in by the previousm administration in its fight against sanctions. The subsidy allows, for instance, South Africa to sell car batteries in Zimbabwe and Zambia at a price well below their production price in those countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a part of their economic reforms, most countries in the region have removed all producer subsidies. This is despite levels of productivity in South Africa being well below Zimbabwe and, in certain sectors, below even Tanzania and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere within the SADC, governments and business alike accuse South Africa of pandering to both its trade organisations and its militant trade unions who fear competition and job losses. South Africa counters that its fight is not against imported goods from the SADC alone, but also from the Far East. South African officials allege that Zimbabwe has been used as a conduit for cheap textiles from China, dressed up as Zimbabwean clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accusing South Africa of economic imperialism, manufacturers in the SADC say that it is unfair to penalise the region simply because South Africa is unable to police its civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mark O'Donnell, chairman of the Zambian Association of Manufacturers, says that South Africa has again gone into the laager. &quot;They would like to control the region,&quot; he claims, adding that his country's 13-to-one trade imbalance is worsening by the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appearances appear to back him up. At the Shoprite supermarket on Lusaka's Cairo Road, even the milk is from South Africa -- and the Spur restaurant flies in meat from Johannesburg. On the street, hundreds of hungry vendors sell cheap products as diverse as toys and perfume -- often labelled in Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The region remains divided on how to tackle South Africa's devastating push into Africa, with many countries seemingly willing to let South Africa and Zimbabwe battle it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia would prefer its own dispensation with the southern giant. &quot;We cannot sustain the imbalance,&quot; said O'Donnell, &quot;but our position is not the same as Zimbabwe's. Our impact on the South African economy would be negligible even if the tariffs were removed, whereas Zimbabwe could have a significant impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is another issue and it is charged with emotion. The countries worst affected by South African protectionism are all former &quot;frontline states&quot;, countries which suffered, to a greater or lesser degree, the ravages of destabilisation and the torment brought about by helping and providing shelter to those who now rule South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Donnell says Zambians are hurt by their exclusion -- and Zimbabweans say Mandela is doing more harm to their economy than<BR>apartheid ever did.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The apparent assassination of Kudiratu Abiola, activist wife of imprisoned Nigerian leader Chief Moshood Abiola, is unlikely to prompt South Africa to formulate a stronger policy against Nigeria's military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola (44) died from a gunshot wound to the head in Lagos on Tuesday, the same day Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo publicly acknowledged South Africa had toned down its hardline stance on Nigeria in response to accusations by South Africa's partners on the continent that it was acting against African solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo told Parliament's foreign affairs committee it was &quot;important to go along with other countries&quot;, while &quot;we have not retracted from our call for Nigeria to embark on democracy&quot;. This confirmed the view that President Nelson Mandela's call for sanctions against Nigeria, first made after the execution last year of Nigerian minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, had been dropped in favour of a softer common African position.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week the African National Congress's labour partner, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, made a new call for sanctions -- and South African high commissioner to Nigeria, George Nene, joined mourners at Abiola's funeral on Wednesday afternoon -- but it seems unlikely Nzo's ministry will plot a new policy course for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Foreign Affairs representative said: &quot;We decided at a summit that we would work through the SADC (the Southern African Development Community)... I don't think that will change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's deputy high commissioner to Nigeria, Jan van Jaarsveld, said members of the diplomatic corps doubted Nigerian dictator General Sani Abacha's statement that the attack on Kudiratu Abiola, her driver and her personal assistant, had been a robbery attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said: &quot;Her car was forced from the road at a T-junction. People are talking about several shots from an automatic gun. But what raises suspicion is that she died of a single shot to the head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Jaarsveld said the driver had died of several wounds, but the personal assistant, who was unscathed, had been arrested by the Nigerian police &quot;to help with the investigation&quot; . He said this came across as a possible attempt to keep him away from publicly giving his version of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Jaarsveld said in spite of suspicions about the attack, it would not have immediate bearing on South Africa's policy: the police investigation would have to be evaluated first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Millionaire newspaper tycoon Moshood Abiola has been in virtual solitary confinement, awaiting trial on charges of treason, since he declared himself president in 1994 -- the year after the military government run by Sani Abacha annulled elections he appeared to have won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudiratu Abiola, who married him in 1973 and was one of a number of wives -- and was said to be his favourite -- was also one of the main figures in Nigeria's opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month she appeared in court on charges of conspiracy and making false statements. She and two co-accused pleaded not guilty and her trial was to have started on July 17. The charges apparently arose from interviews she gave to Nigerian and foreign media in which she called for her husband's release from prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian police said in a statement they had &quot;directed a full-scale investigation&quot; and pledged that &quot;no stone will be left unturned in unravelling the perpetrators of this heinous crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday police made several arrests when they broke up a protest against the assassination by thousands of students in the city of Ibadan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After crossing the Namibian border into Angola, the average speed of the convoy was about 30 km/h.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - The Angolan military leadership has started to form a unified national army to bring an end to the United Nations' peacekeeping process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move comes as the political leadership tries to shape a new government following the dismissal of the prime minister, the government and the central bank governor by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fernando Franca van Dunem, the national assembly president appointed as prime minister to replace Marcolino Moco, is under pressure to pick a cabinet quickly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the political crisis was erupting in the first week of June, the first 15 officers from Jonas Savimbi's Unita guerrilla army were being incorporated into the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) and the process of selecting 26 000 Unita soldiers for the army was beginning under a two-month deadline set by the FAA chief of staff, General Joao de Matos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Matos said the new army would be complete by July 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At that point the state administration will be restored over the whole country. We are tired of this peace process, it's been going on too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The country is in a morass, the people are exhausted, the international community has had enough. So much money is being wasted by the UN,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within the UN there is growing concern about the credibility of its largest peacekeeping operation, costing more than $1-million a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least half of the 35 000 Unita men registered in the 11 UN quartering areas are not soldiers, according to UN and aid officials. One-third of them came without weapons, according to General Matos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, no heavy weapons of any sort have been handed in, the munitions relinquished are derisory, and new arms supplies are regularly being flown in by Unita from Zaire, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN official said: &quot;Unita has not even begun a serious effort towards disarming and demobilising, 18 months after the Lusaka accords, and there is no sign of any change in their attitudes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mood among both UN and aid agency personnel is pessimistic, despite the robust optimism of the UN secretary general's special representative, Aliyoun Blondin Beye. He believes the problem of non-surrendered weapons will be rectified by Unita, and does not accept that there is any problem with the identities of the people already quartered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Philip Sibanda, the Zimbabwean military commander of the UN force, said, however: &quot;It is clear we do not have the best troops in the quartering areas, we do not have the best weapons, we do not have ammunition or other war stores, explosives, communications equipment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year's ceasefire left Unita in control of over half the country, though some areas are barely populated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Matos said the UN could not monitor what was going on in Unita areas, or where the soldiers outside the quartering areas were being kept.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Most of the SABC's current affairs programmes may be scrapped to accommodate African-language viewers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SABC television analyst Don Seokane said the decision to reduce the corporation's eight current affairs programmes was not yet finalised, but the management of Television News had attended a bosberaad last month where proposals on repositioning the corporation's news department were garnered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Television News management, he said, was only at this stage &quot;considering increasing the time allocated for news bulletins and reducing the number of Focus programmes&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This means news bulletins could be accompanied by packaged current affairs programmes of between 15 and 30 minutes long, in the language used during the news bulletin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Current affairs programmes are predominantly in English and management, in reassessing the situation, felt African-language groups should be accommodated. It was proposed that extra time be latched on to African-language bulletins, allowing for a current affairs programme to occur in any of the indigenous languages,&quot; Seokane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bosberaad involved all the regional news heads, heads of the various sections, including current affairs, and Television News editor-in-chief Joe Thloloe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seokane said it was believed that the various news sections could be more &quot;effective&quot;, and the proposal arose from concerns that current affairs programmes in particular may not be complying with the language requirements stipulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A meeting between Television News management and channel heads was planned this week to gather more proposals and discuss the feasibility of attaching packaged current affairs programmes to news slots, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The length of the current affairs programmes depend on the air time allocated on each channel, but nothing in this regard has been finalised. It is still in the process of discussion and is a mere proposal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the SABC is adamant that the proposal is based around accommodating South Africa's 11 languages, some sources within the corporation argue that this is a cost-cutting exercise, an effort to increase audience ratings and a bid to attract more advertising revenue around its flagship programmes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Zulu royal house faces a House of Windsor-style controversy as its political enemies make sordid allegations of familial sex, royal rivalry, abduction and bribery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Claims by the powerful Prince Clement Zulu that King Goodwill Zwelithini's spokesman Prince Sifiso Zulu had admitted to sexually abusing a young princess is the first salvo in an impending propaganda war of the princes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sifiso Zulu's attorney hit back with claims that Clement had tried to convince Sifiso to vacate his post and settle in the United States. The attorney, Samuel Nkosi, said the sexual abuse allegations appeared to be part of a smear campaign waged by Clement Zulu after Sifiso Zulu refused to leave the country voluntarily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The claims -- first published by the Zulu-language newspaper UmAfrika -- were the subject of serious concern among African National Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party MPs in the provincial corridors of power this week.  Clement Zulu's allegations were the latest in a series of scandals which have plagued Sifiso Zulu since he lurched into controversy in late 1994 as Zwelithini severed ties with IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP-owned Zulu-language newspaper Ilanga claimed last year that Sifiso Zulu had had an affair with Zwelithini's youngest wife, Nompumelelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Sifiso Zulu argued that the latest allegations should be seen in this context, senior ANC KwaZulu-Natal leaders -- including provincial chairman Jacob Zuma -- are said to have intervened in the latest crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC leaders are believed to have taken the allegations -- this time lodged by a royal council heavyweight credited with prising Zwelithini away from Buthelezi -- seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkosi -- who also represents the alleged victims and their mother, Sifiso Zulu's sister-in-law, Gladys Zulu -- blamed the saga on two VIP bodyguards previously assigned to protect Sifiso Zulu. The two princesses reside with him in Durban, while their mother lives along the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clement Zulu alleged that Sifiso Zulu had admitted sexually abusing 21-year-old Princess Nana Zulu when Constable Mfanafuthi Mhlungu confronted him about the matter in his presence. Clement Zulu subsequently reported the matter to Zwelithini, and Gladys Zulu had intended to do the same, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkosi countered that &quot;no charges to that effect have been filed&quot;, and said affidavits from Gladys Zulu and the princesses told a different story.  Excerpts from Gladys Zulu's affidavit in the possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian portray an elaborate plot to discredit Sifiso Zulu: &quot;On about April 9, constables Mhlungu and (Khanyisani) Mazibuko ... asked me to assist them and Prince Clement Zulu to remove Prince Sifiso Zulu from his position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They suggested that we could use my children as if they were sexually abused or ill-treated in whatever manner, and report that to the king so that the king could remove him as his spokesperson. They told me Prince Clement had already prepared the king, therefore our effort would be an easy one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rejecting the allegation, Clement Zulu said: &quot;Gladys is lying because she wants to protect somebody and smear me.&quot; He added that he was &quot;very happy&quot; with Sifiso Zulu 's performance as the monarch's spokesman and had &quot;no reason&quot; to try to discredit him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clement Zulu admitted he had suggested that Sifiso Zulu should &quot;try to get a scholarship to go overseas&quot;, but said this was intended to avoid a scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gladys Zulu further alleged that the two VIP guards had offered to bribe her to report the allegations to Zwelithini, and on April 12 had &quot;produced their police appointment cards and ... took me by force, very much against my will and very much against our tradition, to Nongoma (in northern Natal).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gladys Zulu said a car accident prevented the group from seeing the monarch. Nkosi filed a complaint with National Protection Services' Senior Superintendent, Hendrick Olivier, alleging the VIP members had threatened her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olivier said possible charges related to the car accident were under investigation, but &quot;the complainant refused to file charges&quot; relating to the harassment allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a further twist, the car in which Gladys Zulu and the VIP members crashed is alleged to belong to an Elias Khumalo -- a man whose name has cropped up as a possible replacement for Sifiso Zulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the allegations are in the hands of KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally, according to South African Police Service Director Bala Naidoo.  He stressed that they currently rested on a &quot;third party report -- there is no statement of complaint as yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the lapse of time, it appears no complaint will be lodged.  However, the war of the princes has added fuel to recent public controversy over the Zulu royal family. Debate over the monarch's R17-million budget and a new luxury mansion he is alleged to be eyeing in Durban's La Lucia suburb -- denied by the royal council -- and political controversy over his relationship with IFP Premier Frank Mdlalose have put the monarch and his family in the public spotlight as never before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newspaper reports involving the intimate details of royal family squabbles were unheard of in the days when Zwelithini was ensconced in the former KwaZulu homeland. Constitutional monarchy is changing all that, as the family is quickly learning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - If everyone is entitled to 15 minutes of fame, Sol Kotane's quarter-hour struck when his photograph was splashed across a full page in RDP News, in the illustrious company of Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, and FW de Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Together they made up a pull-out centrefold, with such captions as &quot;The leader of the nation and the architect of the RDP&quot; for Mandela; &quot;Leading the Sacs in communicating the RDP&quot; for Kotane; and &quot;Close to the heartthrob of the RDP&quot; for De Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sol Kotane, head of the South African Communications Service (Sacs), has become a figure of major controversy after championing plans to establish a government-funded news agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last weekend, Sunday Independent columnist Zakes Mda described the idea as &quot;the mother of all hare-brained schemes&quot;, concluding: &quot;The government needs to communicate, but a government-controlled news agency is neither viable nor desirable in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a man who is often dismissed as a wannabe propagandist, Kotane appears engagingly frank as he replies to the battering he has received in the media. He seems embarrassed that the RDP News -- published by Sacs -- had, with the photos, stepped into what one seasoned hack described as the &quot;Ho Chi Minh school of journalism&quot; rather than sticking to its brief of reporting on the development of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From a journalistic point of view I don't think it was in good taste to do that, especially to include my photograph,&quot; Kotane admits, adding that RDP News is produced by a team and it was not his decision to run the large photos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotane's background can only add to fears that his news agency plans are a way of using taxpayers' money to trumpet the glories of the government.  Most of Kotane's media education took place under the auspices of the Department of Information and Publicity (DIP) of the ANC in exile, where former colleagues say he did not hold a particularly senior position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His active experience in the print media consists of a spell as a junior on the Bulawayo Chronicle, a faithful follower of the Mugabe regime, and at the Pan-African News Agency (Pana) which is funded by the Organisation of African Unity and which operates spasmodically. Pana's failure has been blamed on its inability to offer a voice independent from the outpourings of state- controlled agencies across the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suspicions about Kotane's intentions deepened when, while explaining his proposals to Parliament's Select Committee on Communications, he praised the partisan Zimbabwean government news agency, Ziana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotane insists he was quoted out of context on Ziana -- it was only one example among several that he cited, he says. And his long association with the ANC translates not into a conviction that the regime will always do right, but into a blind faith that the government's commitment to freedom of expression will never falter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Looking at the position of the government, what I see is support for freedom of<BR>expression -- not the muzzling of opinions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only will government continue to allow other media a free rein, he believes, but government can succeed where the commercial press failed in mirroring South Africa to itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pre-empts suspicions of a hidden agenda by taking an old-school liberal view of the media. News, in Kotane's view, is not a means of control -- it is a service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government has an obligation to establish something to help deliver information to its constituency,&quot; he says. &quot;I appreciate the role played by the newspapers and Sapa (the South African Press Association, an independent national agency). But is that enough?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike many who bang the empowerment drum, he sounds almost apologetic about raising the question of race, and his criticisms of the shortcomings of existing media could not be more diplomatic: &quot;In the 60 years of Sapa's existence, the majority voice never had a platform. I am not lumping the blame on Sapa -- the regime of the day did not want to encourage a diversity of opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotane's vision is of a news agency which can reach into the remotest village and the most miserable squatter camp in the country, and come back with the stories. And if no one else is going to do this, then the government can and the government will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotane declares the agency will enjoy editorial autonomy and will even carry articles critical of the government -- a notion which has been greeted with scepticism by observers of the history of any number of other well-intentioned schemes in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kotane is bullish about the agency's chances of success in an environment very different from countries like Zimbabwe where state-owned newspapers are a captive market for a state- owned news agency. He would like to see the large papers subscribe to a government service, but if they don't, then he is confident that mostly rural community papers will jump at the chance of news that is not filtered through the big city press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some have accused Kotane of being an empire- builder, citing the pin-up portrait in RDP News, and Kotane's brief but amply rewarded spell as head of Bophuthatswana Broadcasting which began with no prior broadcasting experience, and ended after little more than a year with a retrenchment package of around R100 000. This incident is one which Kotane explains away without embarrassment: he says he was entitled to R500 000, but thought it would not be appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He unblinkingly refutes the idea that the proposed news agency will continue to swallow taxpayers' money until the end of time: if it has served its purpose after a decade, then let it be disbanded, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Victor Moche, who worked with Kotane in the DIP, describes him as &quot;not ambitious, but tenacious -- sometimes to a frustrating level. When he bites into something he has to be prised off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to Kotane, it is clear that it will take a lot to prise him away from his plans for a government news agency. He acknowledges that the future of government communications policy is still a matter for discussion, but the enthusiasm with which he talks about the agency plan makes it quite clear where his intentions lie -- never mind the costs to the taxpayer, and the fears that a state news agency will inevitably become a propaganda tool.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela was to have left South Africa on Tuesday for a largely symbolic visit, during which he would have addressed the Angolan Parliament. It was intended as a gesture of goodwill to send a signal that the United Nations-brokered peace process was working and to boost confidence in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The president sent a note to President Dos Santos this morning asking that the visit be rescheduled due to prevailing circumstances,&quot; said presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The president feels it would be inconsiderate to impose a state visit of this magnitude on the Angolan government while they were undergoing a period of transition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the letter Mandela assured Dos Santos of his full support in addressing the problems which had led to the dissolution of the government and said he was committed to ensuring the success of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo will travel to Angola on Monday to convey a personal message to President Dos Santos from Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Monday, Dos Santos axed prime minister Marcolino Moco and all his ministers and suspended the country's foreign exchange trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is getting rid of the people blamed for the economic crisis in the country,&quot; said Institute for International Affairs researcher Glenn Oosthuysen. &quot;He could be making them scapegoats, however. Angola is run by the military -- the generals have their finger in every economic pie. Civil society doesn't really exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By presidential decree, Dos Santos named Fernando Franca van Dunem as the new prime minister. Van Dunem now has five days to form a new government, which is expected to make better headway in pushing through economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oosthuysen said he expected Unita would &quot;make a meal of it&quot; should the new government comprise only members of the ruling party, the MPLA, but said this would only be of rhetorical value. &quot;It is too early to expect Unita to come into the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A government of national unity, with key ministries for Unita, is due to be formed at some stage this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita leader Jonas Savimbi's troops were not yet demobilised and each side was accusing the other of rearming. It was unclear what progress had been made on the integration of the two forces, due to have begun on June 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He disclosed this during a press conference last week at which he announced that 581 patients had their eye sight restored in the north-western town of Bahr Dar on Lake Tana.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBABANE, Swaziland - Swaziland said Wednesday it had established the country's first anti-corruption unit in an effort to curb massive graft in the public and private sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its official gazette published Wednesday, the government said a bill providing for a budget allocation for the operations of the new unit was passed by parliament earlier in 1996. A motion instructed Justice Minister Maweni Simelane to set up the unit as soon as possible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A followup bill, explaining full details of the powers of the unit and it operations, is to be tabled in parliament within the next two weeks. It is expected to pass without delay and be given royal assent for it to become law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simelane said, in the gazette, that the unit would be manned by 25 officers. The posts are to be advertised to get the right people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unit's officers will be empowered to arrest, without warrant, any person suspected of an offence bordering on corruption. These officers will be empowered to use force &quot;as is reasonable&quot; in the circumstances to effect arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In what is seen as intended to be a no-nonsense unit, the agency will also be empowered to over-ride the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in deciding whether to proceed with prosecutions of suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These clauses reflect frequently expressed public dissatisfaction at the soaring rate of serious crime and the blatent large-scale corruption of the police and the office of the DPP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of senior police officers have been transferred over the past few months following alleged police involvement with criminals including drug traffickers and smugglers of stolen vehicles between Swaziland and neighboring Mozambique and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public confidence in the country's judicial system has been shaken, recently, by allegations of fraud against the director of public prosecutions, Adinkrah Donkoh. The police have completed their investigations into allegations that he tried to defraud the Swaziland Royal Insurance Corporation, in connection with his car damaged in an accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police docket has been handed to the DPP office but there is confusion as to who will decide whether Donkoh should be charged and prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBABANE, Swaziland - A total of 161 people died of tuberculosis in Swaziland since January this year, according to figures issued by the kingdom's T.B. Control Offices in Manzini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figures, given during Swaziland's T.B awareness week, indicated that 60 of the deaths occured during the past three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Dr Casphina Mabuza, the medical officer incharge of the Swazi T.B control program, some 480 new T.B cases were diagnosed between January and March this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mabuza said the death rate for 1995 was 215 from a total of 2050 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuberculosis cases have been rising since 1993 when 1400 new cases were diagnosed, causing 95 deaths. The next year, 1897 cases were recorded with 147 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with the PANA Correpondent in Mbabane Tuesday, Mabuza said what was even more frightening was that the patients who died had reported their illness to the country's hospitals and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The medical officer said that even the officially reported cases and deaths were no doubt the tip of the iceberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to her, the sharp increase in T.B cases in the country was in proportion to the rapid increase in HIV and AIDS. Similar increases in T.B infections have been noted in other countries with high HIV prevalence in the African region and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest HIV figures from the Swazi health ministry show that over 20 percent of the kingdom's sexually-active population lived with the virus that causes the incurable human immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other factors that fanned the disease include poor sanitation, unbalanced diet resulting from mass movements of populations, refugees from war-torn countries in Africa, and neglect by T.B authorities, Dr Mabuza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The doctor said that T.B had become one of the worst and most infectious environmental killer disease in the Swaziland's crowded cities and townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;T.B germs are in the air just waiting to be inhaled unknowingly by people. We are all at risk. There is nowhere to hide,' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked how people could protect themselves from inhaling unseen T.B.  germs, Dr. Mabuza advised against spending hours in crowded closed places such as bars where coughs and sneezes spread the diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tuberculosis is spread by several species of mycobacterium, collectively called the tubercle bacillus from which the abreviation &quot;T.B&quot; originated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In man, T.B is caused by the human and bovine varieties of the bacillus, mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycobacterium bovis, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mabuza said the best protection from the bacillus was the natural body resistance to disease. This does not work in already weakened bodies, including those of people who live with HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Mabuza said that the recipe against the disease is a balanced diet, fresh air and exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she warned that without protected sex to avoid HIV infection, all other protective measures amount to nought.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda - Former Ugandan head of state, Tito Okello Lutwa, who died Tuesday in a Kampala hospital, will be accorded full military honours at his burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a programme released by the office of the president, Lutwa, 82, will be burried Thursday at the family ancestral ground in the border district of Kitgum, north of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors at Nsambya hospital, where the former army general had been hospitalised since May 14, declined to disclose the cause of death. However, family friends said he died of liver and heart ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okello was first admitted in critical condition in March at Nsambya hospital. Then, when his condition worsened, he was flown to a university hospital in Frankfurt, Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a month of intensive care he seemed to have recovered and left Germany for London to meet members of his family. He flew back May 14 and was immediately readmitted at Nsambya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his condolence message, President Yoweri Museveni described Lutwa as &quot;a great man&quot; who was dedicated to the service of his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lutwa assumed the chairmanship of Uganda's Military Council, which overthrew the second government of Milton Obote in 1985. Six months later, on January 25, 1986, the National Resistance Army of Yoweri Museveni ousted his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He fled into exile in Sudan for a year before he was granted political asylum in Tanzania. In 1994, he briefly stayed in Kenya before he returned to Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lutwa thus becomes the first former head of state to return and die at home. Two former heads of state, Edward Mutesa, the first post-independence president, and Yusuf Kironde Lule, died in London in 1969 and 1984.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia said Wednesday that three donor countries had indicated they would withhold aid to the country, and two others expressed reservations over the new constitution, which bars Zambians with foreign parents standing for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain, Norway and the United States had indicated their withdrawal of bilateral aid to Zambia after President Frederick Chiluba assented to the bill, Foreign Minister Christon Tembo said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that Denmark and the Netherlands had expressed reservations on the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press briefing, Tembo said that the donors were in particular concerned with the timing of the amendment of the constitution which they felt was intended to eliminate former President Kenneth Kaunda from contesting this year's presidential elections. Kaunda had Malawi parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister said that the government had already held meetings with donors and only a few of them were sceptical over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries belonging to the Southern African Development Community had been briefed on the matter and they indicated that the problem of the constitution bill was an internal matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, two countries, which Tembo did not name, have disputed the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Chiluba has appealed to the donor countries to cooperate with his government to develop the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said punishment by donors to withhold aid to Zambia was targetted at ordinary citizens who made the decision to enact the new constitution. He was speaking during the swearing-in ceremony of the newly appointed ministers and other government officials at state house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president condemned Zambians who attack his government while visiting other countries, saying their action was unfortunate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where is your pride? Even in poverty there must be a bit of order to preserve our country and promote democracy,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's inspector-general of police, Ibrahim Coomassie, has ordered a full-scale investigation into Tuesday's slaying of Kudirat Abiola, the outspoken wife of detained millioniare-politician Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No stone will be left unturned in unravelling the perpetrators of this heinous crime,&quot; Coomassie said in an appeal for public cooperation in tracing the killers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing the killing by yet-unidentified gunmen as &quot;a serious development,&quot; he said a crack team from the police anti-robbery squad, headed by a commissioner, had been charged with the probe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat Abiola, 44, and her driver were shot and killed in the attack, which has aroused national outrage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ore Falomo, the personal physician to Moshood Abiola, said he was with the politician's wife during the three hours of surgery before she died at the Lagos Eko Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Falomo described her death as &quot;a blow to the Abiola family.&quot; A former civilian state governor and leader of the opposition National Democratic Coalition, Adekunle Ajasin, expressed shock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although I don't know who is responsible, I don't see why the young lady had to be killed,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another politician, Joe Nwodo, was undergoing a medical check-up at hospital when Kudirat Abiola died. &quot;It's a sad story,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official of the Campaign For Democracy, Moshood Erunbami, said the &quot;death of Kudirat is a shame on those who can kill the body but not the soul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sympathisers were Wednesday streaming to the Abiola family house in Ikeja, a northern suburb of Lagos. Kudirat Abiola is expected to be buried today, in accordance with Muslim rites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swift reactions to the killing have also come from Britain, the United States and South Africa. These countries, which have strained diplomatic relations with Nigeria, have nonetheless urged the government in Abuja to investigate the killing with utmost care and ensure that the culprits are brought to book.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was unclear Wednesday if the shooting was an assassination or pure violent crime, which has been on the increase especially in Lagos, the nation's economic hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The upsurge in urban crime prompted the military government to launch, in May, a 4,000-strong joint police and military task-force code named &quot;Operation Sweep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat Abiola had been locked in a family feud with Abiola's eldest son, Kola, over the millionaire's legal representation in his treason trial.  She was also on bail from another case for alleged conspiracy and false publication before her death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola is in detention awaiting trial for declaring himself President of Nigeria after the annulled June 1993 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - President Nelson Mandela of South Africa has expressed shock at what he described as the &quot;heinous act&quot; of the shooting of Kudirat Abiola, wife of the imprisoned Nigerian political leader Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat Abiola and her driver were shot dead by gunmen Tuesday near her Lagos home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether South Africa's policy toward Nigeria would be affected by this development, presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the government was keeping a close watch on the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African foreign minister, Alfred Nzo, described the attack as &quot;horrifying&quot; and urged the Nigerian military government to free Moshood Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Nzo said South Africa has eased off on its hard-line stance against Nigeria. He told the South African national assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee in Cape Town Tuesday that this action had resulted from allies of the Organization of African Unity accusing South Africa of acting against African norms of solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa was the only African country to demand penalties against the Abacha administration and which withdrew its high commissioner from Lagos, following the execution of human rights activist and writer, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and several of his colleagues in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, Nzo added, South Africa had been pressured into a rethink on its Nigerian policy and he had been compelled to make a statement in the OAU confirming South Africa's commitment to African solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said African solidarity was important to South Africa but the country had not retreated from its demand that Nigeria embark on a democratic transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government in Abuja has already started what it says is just such a program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBABANE, Swaziland - The media will be allowed to cover hearings of Swaziland's Public Accounts Committee whose first sitting, this year, will be held Wednesday, its chairman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roy Fanourakis said Thursday that since the press served as the eyes of public it should be present when principal secretaries of ministries were grilled by the committee, concerning failure to control funds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fanourakis' decision came despite strong opposition from ministers and top civil servants, embarrassed by disclosures of overspending and misuse of governments funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the worst offenders is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was criticized, strongly, in the auditor general's report in parliament in 1995 for massive overspending and irregular use of governments funds by its missions abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee was set up by parliament two years ago after budget surpluses changed to massive deficits reaching a record high of some 300 million rand (about 1.5 million U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an effort to reduce government expenditure this year, Finance Minister Derek Von Wissel trimmed budget allocations to ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his budget speech, he said that this was &quot;a pre-emptive measure to avoid the need for a tougher structural adjustment program being imposed on Swaziland by the International Monetary Fund.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANESBURG, South Africa - South Africa's tourism boom has slumped dramatically in the face of ongoing crime and rising costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The number of foreign visitors to the country &quot;which rose almost 60 percent in the first quarter of 1995&quot; managed a meagre 3.4 percent increase between January and March 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Latest figures from the Central Statistical Services show that some 324,000 foreign visitors entered South Africa in the first quarter of this year, an unimpressive increase over the estimated 313,000 during the corresponding period of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total increase for 1995 was 51 percent -- more than one million foreign tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president of the Association of South African Travel Agents, Roger Mackie, claims that South Africa has the biggest crime problem in the world outside war zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has also criticized the government's role in tourism, expressing the need for consistency with a long-serving minister drawn from the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is time that the government acted positively on expectations that tourism is set to overtake mining as the country's top revenue source,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Tourist Corporation, or SATOUR, does not share Makie's pessimistic view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spokesman Martin Van Heerden says crime is not such a telling factor, although costs in South Africa are becoming high. He predicts a 20-percent increase in tourism for the country during 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA, Burundi - The remains of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross, slain in an ambush Tuesday in north-western Burundi, were repatriated from Bujumbura Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bodies were those of two Swiss Red Cross workers who were shot dead Tuesday in an ambush in the guerilla-war troubled Cibitoke province in north-western Zaire. The third was an Italian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the bodies left the Burundi capital, all non-governmental organizations operating in this war-torn country decided to suspend their activities for one week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Burundi Prime Minister, Antoine Nduwayo, Thursday called for the creation of a common front against &quot;organized crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking during separate audiences with representatives of communal dvelopment associations and trade unions, Nduwayo said he was deeply surprised &quot;to see that Burundians were increasingly becoming used to war and organized crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as we accommodate the plague, we cannot combat it, Nduwayo told a meeting of communal development associations here Thursday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Burundi society is heading towards its own destruction if we accept crime as a day to day event,&quot; warned the prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing trade union leaders, Nduwayo called for &quot;responsible behavior from people who know they are really in a war and who cannot afford disorder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He called for discipline among civil servants, whom he asked to contibute a monthly wage each towards the war effort to enable the government double the size of the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The people of Burundi are responsible enough to know that if we do not develop an appropriate defense, the entire salary can even disappear, &quot; he told the trade unionists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nduwayo condemned what he termed as the passiveness of people, who, due to ethnic affinities or fear of reprisals, say nothing, even when crimes are committed in broad daylight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a few years or months, &quot;the assassins will turn against us if we do not expose these criminals,&quot; the prime minister warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nduwayo recently launched a self-defense plan under which civilians from all ethnic groups would run to an army protected safe area in case of an attack by guerillas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi has drifted into virtual civil war since the assassination of that country's Hutu elected President Melchior Ndadaye in Oct. 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, more than 100,000 civilians have been killed in revenge killings between the majority Hutu ethnic group and the minority Tutsi, who are dominant in the army.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso - Burkina Faso has withdrawn its recognition of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), whose admission into the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1984 caused Morocco's departure from the continental body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement issued by the cabinet in Ougadougou Wednesday said the decision was motivated by &quot;the concern to strengthen the principle of self-determination.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nonetheless, the cabinet pledged to support the efforts of the United Nations and the OAU to resolve the problem of Western Sahara's decolonization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ownership of the phosphate-rich former Spanish colony has been under dispute since Spain pulled out in 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same year after Spain's unilateral withdrawal, Morocco occupied the desert territory claiming that it historically belonged to the kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> King Hassan II led a well-publicized &quot;green&quot; march into Western Sahara to proclaim himself as the country's legitimate ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This view was strongly opposed by the POLISARIO front, which fought against the Moroccan troops posted there, with support from Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> POLISARIO proclaimed the territory as a soverign state known as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, SADR has been recognized by at least 60 countries throughout the world, including members of the OAU to which it became a full member in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, Nelson Mandela's South Africa became the latest African state to recognise SADR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations is currently trying to arrange a referendum to enable the Sahrawi people choose whether they want to be considered as Moroccans or as independent SADR citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the exercise has been hampered by problems of knowing who were the territory's real indigenous people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia's fomer President Kenneth Kaunda Thursday urged Southern African states, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the international community to help the campaign against recent constitutional amendments and other bad laws in his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to journalists in Lusaka Thursday, Kaunda claimed there were plans by the government to ban his opposition United National Indepence Party (UNIP) and arrest another 17 of its leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eight of UNIP's leaders, including the party's Vice-President, Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta, have alreday been arrested and have appeared in court, charged with trying to overthrow President Frederick Chiluba's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda in particular appealed to the international donor community not to relent in the pursuit for good governance and respect for equal rights to citizens in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged Southern African states, OAU and donor countries to take effective measures that will bring about good governance and genuine democracy in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When a government enacts laws that offend the basic notions of justice, uses the arms of justice against its own citizens for personal self-preservation, through lies, turns one citizen against another, the only remedy open to the public is non-cooperation with such an evil government,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda demanded immediate and unconditional release of all UNIP political detainees, saying the treason charges prefered against them were tramped up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arresting UNIP leaders is dangerous because troops left without a leader have often become dangerous, he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda declared that although the government has passed the law baring him and his vice-president from contesting this year's presidential and parliamentary elections, they would both contest the elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - Britain and other Western donors plan to meet in London next week to review their relations with Zambia, in the wake of Lusaka's adoption of constitutional amendments that bar some citizens from standing for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed meeting was announced Thursday in a statement issued by the British High Commission in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news release quoted the British Overseas Development minister, Baroness Lynda Chalker, as saying donors would find it increasingly difficult to continue providing government-to-government aid if Zambia continued &quot;down its current path.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chalker, who was speaking in Harare, Zimbabwe, is quoted by the release as saying &quot;we shall be meeting in London next week when we shall see what the news is, what the prognosis is and review the situation.&quot; She described the situation in Zambia as &quot;very sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have strongly supported the political and economic reform programme the MMD included in their manifesto. Free and fair elections are fundamentally important for all countries, especially Zambia,&quot; Chalker was quoted as saying in Thursday's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The British government said it was particularly concerned about the restrictions which the constitution imposed on certain candidates wishing to stand for presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement said these measures risked damaging the democratic system that the MMD itself had fought for so hard before it was elected in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We urge all parties to cooperate in seeking a peaceful solution to the disagreements...we hope sincerely that they can do so soon,&quot; said Chalker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Saturday, the United States said it would review its cooperation with Lusaka unless the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government of President Frederick Chiluba immediately reversed the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba appealed Wednesday to the donors not to slap sanctions on his government saying these would hurt the ordinary Zambians who, he said, had chosen the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would be unfair to punish the innocent Zambian people because we responded to the aspirations of the Zambian people. We need friendship but it should be founded on mutual respect,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the offer, the highest ever promised to track any criminal in the country, police spokesman, Tunji Alapini, said the police inspector-general, Ibrahim Coomassie, &quot;is still appealing to members of the public for information on this distardly act.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press release obtained from the European Union Delegation of the European Commission to Ethiopia, another miles tone in relations between Ethiopia and the European commission is reached with the announcement of the signing of the agreement revising the IV LOME Convention in Mauritius in November 1995. This convention will govern the use of the grant funds of 370 million dollars for Ethiopia up to the year 2,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increase in resources, from 214 MECU for the period 1990-1995, bears concerted witness to the European Commission's desire to maintain the privileged relationship with Ethiopia and contrasts with the general contraction of both bilateral and multilateral aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is anticipated that there will be a programming mission to visit Ethiopia to discuss the use of these funds which will be made available in two branches of 70% and 30%. In addition to the above grant funds there are also funds available to Ethiopia through the Regional Indicative Program as well as through additional financing instruments such as food Aid, Social Rehabilitation Program, STABEX and to support institutional and administrative reforms. Furthermore loan funds are available through the European Investment Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days after celebrating Europe Day (May 9), the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Delegation in Ethiopia, the Charge d'Affaires handed over a note from Prof. Pinheiro, Commissioner for External Relations to ACP states, to the Prime Minister indicating the volume of resources which can be expected in the framework of the Lome Convention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foundation of the Lome Convention, which links 70 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific to the European Union, was laid in the Treaty of Rome. In 1975 the European Community signed the first Lome Convention: During the past twenty years, the Lome convention has provided African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) states with a partnership characterised by security and reliability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Officials from the Investment Office of Ethiopia yesterday discussed with representatives of the business community and members of the House of People's Representatives standing committee for economic affairs the amended investment proclamation of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new Investment Proclamation is a completely revised and expanded form of the original investment decree 15/84 which was considered as vague, not explicit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining the rational behind introducing the new proclamation, the head of the Investment Office of Ethiopia, Ato Tadesse Haile, said that the previous version was prepared hastily and thus had many weaknesses which created problems in its implementation. The new Investment Proclamation No .  . ./96, he said, was a revised and expanded version and is intended to better serve the interests of the society and encourage investors in particular.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Ato Tadesse, the drafting of this proclamation involved serious and extensive research and study and valuable lessons had been drawn from problems encountered in the implementation process of the previous proclamation 15/84 as well as the fruitful experiences of foreign countries, especially those of South East Asia and Africa as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nothing that the new Investment Proclamation will help in the successful execution of the government's five-year plan of peace democracy and development, Ato Tadesse said that it has a great deal of incentive to offer and guarantees aspiring investors, both foreign and domestic, firm security.  He said such details have been clearly and distinctly included, adding this is a marked departure from the Proclamation 15/84 which was &quot;not transparent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new proclamation includes various basic sectors in the production and social areas like education and health, which were not included in the previous Proclamation 15/84 that focused on &quot;limited sectors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the occasion, representatives of the business community posed several questions and reservations on the new proclamation, including on such sectors as minimum capital requirement for foreign investors, which they said should be lowered to 200,000 dollars from 300,000 dollars stipulated by the new proclamation. Ato Tadesse said that this was not a worrying matter as most applications from foreign investors up to now have not complained, adding that the minimum capitals presented were even many times bigger than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also demanded that such general expressions as &quot;other relevant information&quot; found in several articles of the new proclamation be avoided as they are &quot;highly subjective&quot; and create favourable conditions for bureaucratic redtape. They also requested that such activities dealing with those incentives to be given to investors and on ways of land allocation be listed clearly and in detail. They also recommended that at least one, representative from the private sector be given membership of the investment board.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The House of Peoples representatives yesterday discussed a bill on the licensing and monitoring of small scale business credit organisations catering to credit needs of farmers, and microenterprises in urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The law stipulates that the credit institutions would be share companies to be set up only by Ethiopians and could provide loans either in cash or kind.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The licensing and monitoring credit institutions law was necessitated out of the need to incorporate small credit service into the country's fiscal and financial policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A study carried out by the National Bank of Ethiopia and submitted to the house indicated that state and private banks at present serve mostly the business community in major towns and as a result people in the low income groups are suffering at the hands of usurers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An expert from the National Bank said small scale business credit agencies differ from big banks in that their credit amount is decided by the bank and mostly they operate while making losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The house has also looked into a bill amending the code establishing the federal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a three-day legal workshop organised for members of parliament was opened by House Speaker Dawit Yohannes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The house, he said, has the responsibility of legislating and following up the proper interpretation of laws as of gathering public opinion and seeking ways for a joint development endeavours. In this regard, the workshop would greatly help MPs to discharge their duties properly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Ghanaian authorities are getting increasingly worried over what they deem to be the local media's destructive agenda to derail the gains being made in this West African nation's investment drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their concern stems from what they deem as an orchestrated attempt by the media, particularly the independent press, to stifle investment initiatives taken by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is because the image being projected does not reflect the truth and only goes to reinforce a perception, which we are constantly bemoaning,&quot; says Kwesi Ahwoi, Chief Executive of the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre, a government body charged with investment promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Otherwise why should a section of our media scream 'coup d'etat' in banner headlines when they know very well that they do not want one to occur - you know investors do not put their monies in coup prone areas,&quot; stresses Ahwoi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds; &quot;To them (journalists) if there is no bad news about the government and key leading political figures, then there is nothing to write about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwesi Ahwoi is not alone in such condemnation. Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings has often complained bitterly about the supposed anti-government stance of the media, particularly the independent press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plain truth is, the government feels the media have not been an ally in the authorities' desire to bring investment to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have played out to the propaganda of the West,&quot; retorts Kwesi Ahwoi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Ghana embarked on an Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) in 1983, the nation's major ambition has been to encourage foreign direct investment in the country. But this has not materialized to any appreciable level. The investors are not coming as expected, concedes Ahwoi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Ghana succeeded in attracting were only trickies of inflows averaging US$ 35 million of direct foreign investment from 1990 to 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of this, the country embarked on an aggressive and clearly focused image building campaign as a prelude to the investment generation and aggressive investment promotion activities. Between 1994 and March 1996, Ghana featured consistently in the International Herald Tribune, the Euromony Financial Times, Paris Match, Afrique Golfe, USA Today, Business Direction (Singapore) as well as other international journals. Even the Cable News Network (CNN) carried out an effective expose on Ghana as an emerging investment location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Rawlings' personal and direct involvement in the investment drive had also been very beneficial to the country, in that, some investors called in to find out more about the opportunities available after the President's visit to the United States, Singapore and Malaysia last year.  After the intensive image building campaign, Ghana reaped benefits of US$ 150 million from direct foreign investment in 1995 compared to only US$ 35 million average per annum for the preceding years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahwoi says with this seemingly breakthrough, Ghana has succeeded in emerging as a politically and socially stable country with a steady and predictable macroeconomic regime characterized by consistent and emerging transparent and predictable business regulations and procedures. &quot;What is left now is to sustain this position and image, and the local media acting as feeders to the international media have a far greater responsibility and role to secure this,&quot; he stresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The promotion centre head together with other government officials think the Ghanaian media have a different agenda which appears not to be in line with the country's collective interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the President of the Ghana Journalists Association, Mr. Kabral Blay-Amihere thinks otherwise. &quot;If anything, the government should be proud of our performance in calling to attention certain abnormalities in the running of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reckons that if the government thinks that media practitioners should close their eyes to all the happenings around them and offer the government unalloyed support, then journalists would be doing a<BR>disservice to the nation. After all, the media are expected to play a vanguard role which is being fulfilled accordingly, he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwesi Essuman, a veteran journalist, concedes that there may be certain excesses by some journalists, but on the whole, he thinks that his colleagues have really put the Ghanaian authorities on their toes, hence the concern being expressed by government officials. &quot;In the absence of any credible opposition in Parliament, the lot fell on journalists and we have done very well,&quot; he observes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, following a boycott of the Parliamentary elections by the opposition in 1992, the need for a credible opposition seems to have eluded Ghanaians and the media seemingly took it upon themselves to play that role through occasional scrutiny of government policies Most Ghanaians however agree that but for the media, the country could have been run as a one-party state. They agree there have been certain excesses, but these they contend, had come about because of the government's inflexibility and insensitivity to a number of issues.<BR>a role that has driven the two institutions apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, Ghana is at crossroads, where every opportunity that avails itself should be used to stimulate critical discussions, appraisals and decisive action in the drive forward into sustainable nationhood. And this can only be done in a give and take atmosphere, where the government would not subject itself to its line of thoughts alone, but also be guided by constructive criticism which is a basic ingredient for any democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The shea butter tree grows wild in much of the savannah woodlands of the Sudan-Sahelian region of Africa. In West Africa, the shea butter tree is well established as a cash crop. In East Africa, by contrast, the British colonizers ignored it entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now a Ugandan non-governmental organisation (NGO) is teaching local women in the northern part of the country how to process food and cosmetic oil from this neglected wilderness resource. The intention is to generate household incomes and save the environment at the same time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women in Otuke county of Lira district, northern Uganda, are the main beneficiaries of an oil crop project that should boost household incomes considerably in this otherwise neglected area. Otuke in the north-eastern corner of Lira district is a marginal area even in the context of northern Uganda. Households here are among the poorest in the country, having few opportunities to improve their standard of living and often facing real difficulties in meeting basic daily needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time as the project boosts household incomes the local environment in Otuke will be conserved because the people see the need to do so. The source of the oil is a wild tree called Butyrospernum paradoxum more commonly called the shea butter tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the aegis of the shea project of the Cooperative Office for Voluntary Organisations of Uganda (COVOL-Uganda), the shea nut is harvested from the wild where it grows in great abundance in the whole of Otuke county and indeed, the vast savannah region beyond. This area, measuring up to millions of hectares of savannah woodland, extends into southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shea butter is well known in West Africa where it is a long established oil crop. By contrast in East Africa, it is hardly known, perhaps because the British colonial administrators saw no need to encourage its cultivation when there were other oil crops like sesame, groundnut, coconut, and cotton -- the traditional vegetable sources of oil for the manufacture of soaps and cooking oils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later the British encouraged the importation of huge amounts of palm oil from plantations in the Far East. Today, Kenya alone annually imports $200 million worth of vegetable oils, much of which the country could produce itself if the authorities cared to set up the right environment for oil production locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main oil crop for the women of northern Uganda is sesame (simsim) which is both a source of protein for domestic consumption with only a little amount ending up as oil for the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For domestic consumption in Otuke county, the sesame is ground to afine paste and mixed into soups. It is excellent food for children and adults alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to its potential as domestic cooking oil, shea butter is also in high demand as a cosmetic product. Much of the production of shea butter from Ghana goes to Bodyshop, the main retailer of natural beauty products in Great Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Eliot T. Masters, coordinator of the shea butter project in Lira district is very keen on its environment protection component. &quot;It is an integrated long term effort to reinforce a local economy based upon conservation of savannah woodland, in collaboration with the people and the many community based NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We see the primary goal of the project as prevention of environmental degradation before it occurs.&quot; The emphasis is on sustaining the ecological balance in the marginal Lango countryside,adds Masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says this is possible because the need for sustainability of the project is inculcated in the women and other participants at the outset. And this is backed by a series of incentive factors. &quot;It takes 15 years for the shea butter tree to reach productivity stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who wish to grow it are free to do so. However, most women have chosen to harvest the nut from the wilderness while at the same time conserving the woodlands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A highly motivated rural development worker, Masters says the project will remain &quot;fundamentally linked to female incomes and household food security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes it is important to reduce the demands on female time and labour since rural women have other numerous time consuming or labour demanding chores in their daily routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simple mechanical oil presses developed at the University of Technology in Kumasi, Ghana have been introduced in Otuke to help boost productivity.  Two West African experts are helping the women of Otuke to familiarize themselves with the oil extruder presses from Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masters is confident that the COVOL project will meet its target of producing 30 tonnes of oil within 18 months. At least 20 tonnes of this will be sent to Ghana for onward export to England. COVOL has a working arrangement with a company in Ghana that sells shea butte</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to Bodyshop and they are keen to encourage further shea butter output from Eastern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Shea Butter Project will initially run for three years. Several thousand dollars have been secured as funding for the project, with most of the money coming from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through the Kampala based Grants Management Unit, Action Programme for the Environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masters is constantly looking for new outlets for COVOL's products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is in contact with refugee agencies in northern Uganda with a view to selling them a substantial amount of their output for the nutritional uses of refugees in Uganda and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the likelihood that the large number of Sudanese refugees in camps in Uganda will spontaneously set out to produce shea butter oil themselves since the required raw materials are vastly available all over northern Uganda and southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local conservation and development of shea butter will be reinforced by; technical improvement of shea processing to maximize efficiency of women's labour; extension services addressing the needs of local farmers; environmental education through extension services and local micro-enterprise development with a small loans scheme.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Istanbul - As 25,000 delegates from government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious groups, women, youth groups and private sector converge in Istanbul, Turkey from June 3 to 14 to discuss human settlement, poverty, population and the environment, sub-Saharan Africa still disturbingly bears the brunt of these amongst many other woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite advances made in human welfare and technology, there is today a growing polarization between rich and poor and a failure of political will to address the silent but nevertheless threatening emergence of those who cannot make ends meet, millions of whom are concentrated is sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this region, poverty is said to be on the increase. On the UN list of the 52 poorest countries in the world, 32 are in sub-Saharan Africa, while 75 per cent of the zone's population of over 500 million people earn less than one US dollar a day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The human settlements scenario is said to be appalling, more so in fast growing urban centres. Some sub-Saharan African urban populations are growing at an alarming rate. Zimbabwe's urban population was expected to grow from 1.2 million in 1975 to 4.5 million by the year 2000 and to peak to 20.2 million by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Centre for Human Settlement (UNCHS), Habitat, Global Report on Human Settlements, Statistical Annex, (Draft) 1995 further shows that Nigeria which had an urban population of 14.6 million people in 1975 is expected to be home to some 146.9 million by 2025. Sudan which had an urban population of 3 million people will have to house, feed, transport and employ 27 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The population of most sub-Saharan African towns is growing at an average of over 5 per cent per annum. Ethiopia's population, for instance, is said to be growing at 5.53 per cent and Malawi's at 5.88 per cent. The continent's urban population, estimated at 104 million in 1975 is expected to swell up to 804.2 million by 2025.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Often, immigrants in search of better living standards or in flight from conflicts swell up African towns and cities whose infrastructures are static.  This leads to acute overcrowding, the straining of such facilities as water, electricity, means of transport and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also leads to environmental degradation which HABITAT II, also referred to as The City Summit is poised to discuss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task ahead of HABITAT II is ardous and unenviable. What makes the work of the UN body even more difficult is lack of a positive track record of the hosts which could help salvage its image and imbue in sub-Saharan African people trust that this time round, the international forum will come up with viable and sustainable resolutions for their region's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HABITAT II, whose two themes are Adequate shelter for all and Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world was preceded by HABITAT I in 1976, in Vancouver, Canada. But it appears the meeting came out with resolutions which seem to have been swept under the carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the Vancouver summit, the problem of human shelter has deteriorated even further. A United Nations report ahead of the Istanbul conference said that about 100 million people worldwide, mostly women, are today homeless and up to 600 million are poorly and unhealthly housed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Matters have become worse for sub-Saharan Africa. A 1992 World Bank study reports that 220 million people south of the Sahara live in absolute poverty. It adds that 18 of the world's 20 poorest countries are in this region and that due to war, drought, famine and desertification, food production has dropped to a level 20 per cent below the 1970 level while the population has trebled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skeptics wonder whether this time the HABITAT II meeting will reverse this woeful trend. Many issues are poised to be points of discussion at the Istanbul summit. In fact the Istanbul agenda is said to be so expansive that the summit appears to be attempting to solve all of humanity's problems in one sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the HABITAT Agenda, the Istanbul summit will discuss and make recommendations in relation to &quot;the right to adequate housing, which includes access to safe and healthy shelter and basic services,&quot; which the UN publication cites as essential to a person's physical, psychological, social and economic well being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will also discuss &quot;sustainable development of human settlements which combines economic development, social development and environmental protection, with the full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms; including the right to development, and offers means of achieving a world of greater stability and peace, built on ethical and spiritual vision.&quot; How and whether this can be achieved in the near future remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Running up to the Istanbul meeting have been a chain of other international conferences which, among other issues, aimed to alleviate the suffering of the poor. From The Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000, adopted in 1988 through the 1989 World Conference on Education for All to the World Summit for Social Development held in Copenhagen in 1995, little has been said of the gains made by the poor of sub-Saharan Africa. In fact, the situation has continued to worsen instead of improving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development duped the Earth Summit, which was held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 and where Agenda 21 was produced, &quot;the international communities agreed on a framework for the sustainable development of human settlements&quot; according to the HABITAT Agenda. How much sub-Saharan African has benefited is still not clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During this conference, the United States of America reportedly pledged to donate US dollars 125 million towards environmental protection. The Third World, on the other hand, was asked to raise a further 500 million dollars towards the same project. Today, little is known of these noble proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say that all these conferences &quot;have begun to deliver a more holistic, informed and humane message about our global problems and about the cooperative and creative solutions they require.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So be it. However, the Istanbul meeting should aim to translate &quot;the messages about our global problems&quot; into action to solve these real problems, more so in regard to the world's most impoverished region -- the sub-Saharan region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Secretary-General of Habitat II, Dr. Wally N'Dow put it, &quot;Habitat II is more than a conference. It is a recognition...an awakening...that time is running out; that if we want to save the future we have no choice other than to find answers today...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting Juma Assiago, of youth for HABITAT II (Kenya), one may ask; &quot;Will the coming conference be a real step forward in building a different and better sub-Saharan Africa?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Former Ugandan Head of State General Tito Okello Lutwa died at Nsambya Hospital here on June 5. He was 85.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was first admitted to Nsambya in sub-urban Kampala last February, complaining of heart problems. He was flown to West Germany for specialised treatment in late March. Upon his recovery he stayed with his sons in London only to relapse again when he returned to Kampala in May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tito Okello became Uganda's Head of State in 1985 after staging a coup against former President Milton Obote whose constant preoccupation with intrigues, General Okello simply detested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was passed over for promotion as Commander of the Uganda Army in the mid-sixties because Obote was aware that General Okello was against the violent uprooting of the kingdoms ordered by Obote in 1966. Obote appointed Colonel Idi Amin to be his commander, bypassing Okello who was senior to Amin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the overthrow of Milton Obote in 1985, General Tito Okello's short lived military junta attempted to negotiate peace with Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA), whose guerrillas had reached the outskirts of Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya agreed to broker peace between the Ugandan combatants in Nairobi, but Museveni changed his mind after the Nairobi accord. His victorious forces entered Kampala in January 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Okello went into exile in Dar es Salaam until 1992 when he took advantage of a general amnesty extended to him and others by President Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government built him a mansion and offered the general generous retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until his death, he was advisor to Museveni on the North, particularly on Acholi issues. It is General Okello who advised Museveni not to launch an all out offensive against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) of Joseph Kony but instead to use the carrot- approach simultaneously, so as to gradually win over the North including Lango district, former President Milton Obote's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Museveni was the first to send messages of condolence to the family and relatives of General Okello who would be accorded full military honours during his burial scheduled for June 7 in his Kitgum district in the North.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LISBON - Members of the family of the late United States President John Kennedy are expected to travel to Luanda soon to discuss the setting up of a Catholic University in Angola, as well as other aid projects, the Portuguese daily Journal de Noticias reported here on May 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting the US Consul in Luanda Daniel Chase, the daily said the Citizen Energy Corporation, headed by Michael Kennedy, son of Robert Kennedy and nephew of the assassinated president, was in contact with the Angolan government and the Catholic church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 17-member mission was expected in Luanda on May 30 to hold talks with Angola's ministers for Oil, Agriculture and Communications and Transport, as well as with the country's Roman Catholic Archbishop Alexandre do Nascimento, the report said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The establishment of the university would be one of the few major projects the Catholic church intends to establish in the war-torn former Portuguese colony once the ongoing peace process is realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last December, the Catholic bishop of Lubango, Monsignor Manuel Franklin da Costa, announced here during a visit to Portugal that the Catholic church in Angola was preparing to relaunch a radio station, and possibly a newspaper, 20 years after Angola's independence from Portuguese rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monsignor Da Costa said then that Radio Ecclesia would resume broadcasts from January, starting around the capital city, Luanda, with coverage to extend across the war-ravaged nation from March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very important that Radio Ecclesia go on air and provide news with total impartiality ... to help Angolans draw their own conclusions on what is happening in the country,&quot; the bishop stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before 1975, when Angola was still a Portuguese colony, the radio used to operate 24 hours a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop also announced then that another fixture of colonial times, the Apostolado newspaper, may also reappear in March, but it would be a monthly, and not a daily as before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are now rebuilding everything that was destroyed in the war,&quot; the bishop said, referring to the civil war between the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope to be able to do this because it is important for the Angolan people,&quot; Monsignor Da Costa stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop's revelations came amidst mounting fears in Angola that the ceasefire between the warring factions was collapsing as a result of suspicious and conflicting reports on the situation in the country, which would have called the UN-brokered peace into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it is not clear whether both the church radio station and newspaper are operational.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - The World Council of Churches (WCC) intends to raise US dollars 8 million for emergency and other related refugee activities in Africa this year, the organisation's Executive Secretary for Migration, Patrick Taran, has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with APS onJune 6, the WCC official said the amount will be &quot;outside the normal WCC budget for its refugee activities on the continent, which runs at US$ 2 million, annually.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We also intend to raise another US$ 3 million for the WCC sponsored refugee activities in the Sudan,&quot; Taran further said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC Secretary for Migration was briefing APS on the organisation's contribution at the May 30 to 31 international conference here, on the problems of refugees and other displaced persons in the former Soviet Union countries, referred to as Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This was the first time that (the Geneva-based) WCC joined other church-related bodies to make its stand on a vital issue such as the problem of refugees and other displaced persons,&quot; said Taran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other bodies that joined the WCC in making the statement for the conference included the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), International Catholic Migration Commission, Hungarian Interchurch Aid, Caritas Internationalis, the World Young Women's Christian Association and the Conference of European Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We strongly support the emphasis given to prevention of involuntary human displacement...We urge that particular attention be given to the special needs of uprooted women and children in the implementation of the programme of action,&quot; said the WCC statement, signed by Taran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international conference, which brought together more than 60 countries represented by governmental, non-governmental organisations and church-related delegates such as the WCC, was organised jointly by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Organizations for Migration and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From Africa, participants represented Kenya, Zambia, Angola,<BR>Morocco, Algeria, South Africa and Madagascar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WCC statement, some 9 million people have been displaced in the CIS countries since 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Geneva conference was the first full-scale effort by international organisations, the CIS countries and other states to formulate a concerted plan of action for dealing with movements of people described by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata as &quot;of astounding scale and complexity,&quot; said the WCC statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that humanitarian, pastoral and legal action taken by Christians and church-related organisations to attend to refugees, displaced, migrants and uprooted people has often preceded action by governments and inter-governmental agencies, the statement noted that the dissolution of the former Soviet Union, saw church-related organizations become increasingly concerned with the population movements within and to the republics of CIS and neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Geneva meeting also highlighted the commitment by international Christian organisations to continue supporting uprooted people in the CIS region through programmes for training social workers, personnel exchanges, provision of material assistance and other activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WCC and its related church bodies welcomed the CIS conference and &quot;the efforts to elaborate common principles, policy and operational framework for the entire region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The migration phenomenon must be identified as distinct from such issues as drugs, crime and terrorism; these exist and must be combated irrespective of migration, the WCC statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is home to an estimated 6 million refugees out of the world total of 16 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of the estimated 30 million internally displaced persons worldwide, 50 per cent are said to be in African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Thousands of Nigerians took to the streets of the south-western city of Ibadan on June 5 to protest the assassination of Kudiratu Abiola, the senior wife of jailed Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs. Abiola, 44, died on June 4 in Eko Hospital, a private clinic in Ikeja in the north of Lagos near where she lived, shortly after unknown gunmen opened fire on her car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to witnesses, five people in a car opened fire on her Mercedes as she was on her way to a meeting with a senior Western diplomat in Victoria, a residential area of the capital, sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protestors, mostly students, chanted slogans critical of the military regime and demanded the release of Moshood Abiola and acceptance of the June 1993 presidential election results.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola has been in detention on treason charges since June 1994 for declaring himself president on the first anniversary of the election which he claimed to have won, but which was annulled by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The protest march started from Ibadan University and headed towards the headquarters of the Oyo state military governor, Colonel Ike Nwosu but although there were no signs of trouble, police intervened and broke up the march, making several arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibadan, a major city in south-western Nigeria is only a few kilometres from the town of Abeokuta where the late Kudiratu was born.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All was said to be calm also in Lagos where Kudiratu Abiola was to be buried later in the day, with many representatives of the diplomatic corps in Nigeria attending the burial ceremony, diplomatic sources said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Abiola's violent death sent shock waves across the country, sparking a wave of condemnations at home and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The senior wife of the Muslim opposition leader and millionaire newspaper tycoon was also one of the main figures of the Nigerian opposition group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Married to Chief Abiola in 1973, she was said to be his favourite wife among the 15 or so he is reputed to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since her husband's imprisonment, Abiola's wife and sons had been looking after his business interests, including the national daily newspaper Concord headed by another wife, Doyin Abiola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of her husband's most ardent defenders during the past few years, Kudiratu Abiola fought for his cause, publicly calling for recognition that he won the presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month Kudiratu Abiola and two printers had appeared in court charged with conspiracy and making false statements. They pleaded not guilty and her trial was due to start on July 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her family said in a statement signed by eldest son Kola Abiola that &quot;the way and manner of her death is to say the least bizarre and shocking.  The family implores the authorities to do everything within their powers to bring the culprits to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition umbrella Campaign for Democracy group said in a communique that &quot;we do not have to look too far for her assassins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said her struggle to get her husband released had set her on a collision course with the military government, and called for an independent commission to investigate the attack and &quot;bring her killers to justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the only way we can resist the temptation to conclude that she was assassinated by the military junta which has illegally held her husband captive for two years now,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charges apparently arose from interviews she gave to Nigerian and foreign media in which she called for her husband's release from prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian police chief said in a statement they had &quot;directed a full-scale investigation&quot; into Abiola's assassination and pledged that&quot;no stone will be left unturned in unravelling the perpetrators of this heinous crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first reactions from outside Nigeria was that of South African President Nelson Mandela, who expressed shock and disbelief at what had happened in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar reactions were registered from Washington, London and Paris, with the respective authorities calling on the Nigerian government to ensure that the killers of Kudiratu Abiola were brought to book.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - Reports from Liberia say at least 15 people a day are dying from food shortages and disease in and around the north-estern town of Tubmanburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tubmanburg has been cut off by nearly two months of bloody factional fighting in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the Lutheran World Federation (LWF), heading a group of relief organisations including the Catholic Relief Service,has scaled down operations in Liberia following increasing insecurity in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LWF said armed men are preventing the few remaining relief workers from carrying out their duties. Most aid agencies and their staff were evacuated from Monrovia when factional fighting erupted there early April, while a United States naval task force of 2000 marines has been stationed off Liberia ever since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press release issued from the Ecumenical Centre in Geneva, Switzerland, following a meeting of 12 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on May 28, more than 400 vehicles belonging to aid agencies including the United Nations, were looted during the recent fighting. The statement put the value of the vehicles, other equipment and resources at US$ 35 million since early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement issued by the LWF said the NGOs' action is due to the repeated abuse of humanitarian principles and materials. The statement quoted the NGOs as saying it is time to break a cycle of broken promises and stop contributing to the profits of the warring factions and fueling the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agencies, drawn from both church and secular organisations, said they would provide only &quot;targeted minimal life-saving interventions&quot; in order not to unwillingly prolong the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said their decision to limit emergency response, taken late May, would be communicated to the people of Liberia, the warlords, and to the wider international community including the US government, the European Union, the UN and its agencies, the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG and the governments of the Economic community of West African states (ECOWAS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a senior US official has accused troops from the West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG, of being involved in the looting. The official said recently the troops &quot;are heavily involved, and have been involved since the day they arrived, in ripping off Liberians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;West African governments ought to police ECOMOG better,&quot; he is quoted as saying adding that Nigerian members of the peacekeeping force were particularly at fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official's statement came after State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said recently that Liberian looting &quot;has reached outrageous heights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burns said the United States was asking West African countries to cooperate in the inspection of ships in their ports which they have reason to believe are transporting stolen goods and to facilitate the return of looted property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Monrovia has been emptied,&quot; Burns told reporters, adding that the rival factions vying for control of the country were not the only culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State Department spokesman went on to say that three recent ships were responsible for looting &quot;large quantities of goods&quot; in Monrovia from the United Nations, NGOs and private businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burns further alleged that the Bulk Challenge, after receiving permission to disembark more than 1000 passengers in Ghana, departed for Nigeria with looted property still in its hold. The ship had spent 10 days at sea with the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Tubmanburg situation, witnesses are quoted saying the only hospital near the town, Guthrie Hospital, has been looted and forced to close down. Tubmanburg was also the scene of heavy fighting between ECOMOG troops and Ulimo-J fighters last December.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - A supreme court judge has cautioned Ugandan men against interfering with the democratic rights of their wives or in any way discriminating against them for exercising their right to vote for candidates of individual choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Husbands keep off your hands from your wives and let them enjoy and exercise their newly recognised freedoms,&quot; Supreme Court judge Justice Benjamin Odoki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to reports that a number of women had been battered throughout the country in the aftermath of the recently concluded presidential polls, the judge said it was a criminal offence for husbands to beat their wives for voting candidates of their choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Odoki who was officiating at the launching of Guidebook on Domestic Violence early June said that wife battering, assault or any other form of discrimination against women was prohibited by Uganda's new Constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to press and other reports, a number of women were beaten and invariably intimidated for supporting, actually voting for or celebrating the victory of a candidate their husbands did not favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one incident, Jesca Kasiri of Nawandyo in Iganga district, Eastern Uganda, was allegedly beaten into a coma by her husband, Peter Kolwa, after she revealed to him she had voted for Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mukono district, a middle-aged Karim Lubega of Kikuba Nkima village, is suspected to have beaten his wife, Rose Namubiru, 40, to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a different but related case, a bicycle mechanic in Arua town staked his wife against another man's Uganda Shillings 100,000 (US$1000) over the outcome of the presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These developments prompted the Alert Group for the Uganda Women's Network (UWN) to petition President Museveni and the Chairman of the Interim Electoral Commission (IEC) to intervene and put a stop to the &quot;intimidation and harassment of wives by their husbands&quot; and to treat any such violence as &quot;serious crime&quot; and not &quot;domestic dispute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group further asked the government and the IEC to tell all Ugandans that women's rights are human rights and to re-emphasize the fact that women have rights as citizens of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women also demanded reassurance that the Government will protect them and their property during and after elections. The group said that police should always be called in where there is intimidation, harassment and violence against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Justice Odoki: &quot;Such acts are criminal, unconstitutional, degrading and unacceptable in a free and democratic society like ours. Women have equal democratic rights with men and do not have to consult their husbands on whom to vote for in a public election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitution also prohibits cultures or traditions which are against the dignity, welfare or interest of women or which undermine their status, Justice Odoki said, adding, &quot;the battered women's syndrome could lead to despair and hopelessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that though emphasis has been traditionally placed on physical abuse, there was a need to pay more attention to the psychological consequences of domestic violence as one way of averting such despair and hopelessness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guidebook was written by the National Association of Women Judges (NAWJ) as a follow-up to a meeting of the International Association of Women Judges (JAWJ). Held in 1992 in San Diego, United States, the meeting among other highlights resolved to treat domestic violence as a major issue that requires investigation and public awareness in each individual member country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NAWJ was formed in 1994 and has since provided counselling services to spouses, both men and women, and helped in sensitising the general public on gender issues. Next August, the NAWJ will host a regional conference for Africa on domestic violence, marriage and property rights, Justice Mukasa Kikonyogo, a spokesperson of the association said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It now remains to be seen whether men will heed Justice Odoki's caution during the forthcoming parliamentary elections for the 214 &quot;normal constituency seats&quot; scheduled for June 27. These will be followed by local authorities elections at a date yet to be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of many attempts to address one aspect of gender imbalance, the new constitution provides for 39 additional elective district seats specifically for women - one for each of the country's 39 districts. These will be elected on June 20, six days ahead of the normal constituency polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are 86 women candidates for the 39 district seats while a total of 26 women will contest in 24 of the 214 normal constituencies in straight fights with male contestants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In her address, Justice Mukasa Kikonyogo thanked the Government for its continued policy to correct the gender imbalance in the Ugandan society, which she said was largely responsible for domestic violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Eight members of former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP), including its vice president, were charged with treason on June 4 over a string of bombings, a charge which is punishable by death in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have been accused of forming a group calling itself Black Mamba, which has claimed responsibility for recent bomb attacks in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The previously unknown group surfaced in response to a new constitutional amendment which effectively barred Kaunda from running for re-election later this year because his parents were not born in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP vice president Inyambo Yeta, former Finance Minister Rabson Chongo and Kaunda aide Muhabi Lungu appeared with five others -- including three former army officers -- in the Lusaka magistrates court in connection with four counts of treason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda defied a heavy police presence to address a crowd of about 700 UNIP supporters outside the court, accusing President Frederick Chiluba's Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) government of trying to create a state of emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are dealing with little frightened criminals,&quot; the former president said, claiming that the government was trying to block an opposition rally scheduled for the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight men have been accused of involvement in a bomb blast which damaged a wall at State House two weeks ago, planting a bomb at the Intercontinental Hotel in Lusaka and the bombing of the government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper offices in the town of Ndola the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They were all arrested on June 2 and 3 and UNIP officials said they expected more of their members to be picked up in the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight UNIP members were not asked to plead and were remanded in custody until a High Court hearing, expected later this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from threatening to plunge the country into an unprecedented political uncertainty, the controversial new constitutional amendment already signed into law by the Zambian parliament, has also been attracting unfavourable international attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 2, the United States also threatened to review its Zambian aid programmes following the controversial constitutional amendment, a US State Department communique released by the US embassy in the Zambian capital said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the light of the government of Zambia's action, the United States is reviewing its bilateral relationship, including assistance programmes in Zambia,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US aid includes some 20 million dollars for health matters and legislative reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba recently signed into law the amendment which stipulates that presidential candidates' parents must have been born in Zambia, and effectively barred Kaunda from running in the elections later this year because his parents came from Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, who heads the opposition UNIP, has vowed to break the law if he is not allowed to stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US statement said that the United States deplored the constitutional amendment, which it said limits Zambians' right to choose their president freely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added that the amendment was a serious threat to the integrity and credibility of the electoral process and significantly undermined Zambia's democratic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States said it had repeatedly expressed concern over the amendments to the Zambian constitution, and called on Zambia to reverse the changes and take steps to ensure the elections were free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Minister Ronald Penza, quoted by the state-owned Sunday Times of Zambia, criticised the US action, saying it would influence decisions by other donor nations, although he said US aid was insignificant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was unfair of the United States to dictate the pace of democratisation in Zambia, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sacked the government on June 3 in an effort to rescue the country's collapsing economy, and named the respected parliamentary speaker Fernando Van Dunem as the new prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Central Bank governor Antonio Gomes Furtado was also dismissed and Dos Santos suspended the currency exchange market, saying that all &quot;strategic&quot; banking operations now had to be authorised by the president alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The system of production is paralysed and the social situation has worsened,&quot; Dos Santos said in a message to the nation that clearly blamed sacked Prime Minister Marcolino Moco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The health and education services have collapsed. It is time to change things and those who have made mistakes must assume the responsibility,&quot; Dos Santos said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying that formerly Marxist Angola must advance step by step to a market economy, the president set as targets the revival of production reduced to nothing -- apart from the oil industry -- by 20 years of civil war, the repair of basic infrastructure and reform of the banking system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said there must be a single rate of exchange for the national currency, the kwanza, which is officially worth 55,000 to the US dollar but on the black market fetches 240,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the aims are hardly different from those set out in the Economic and Social Plan drawn up in April last year, which the Moco government had totally failed to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos pledged to introduce a realistic wage policy -- the minimum wage is about six US dollars a month -- as well as fight corruption, embezzlement and illegal immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also made a small but important gesture to Jonas Savimbi, leader of the formerly rebel Union for the Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement, by promising to put into effect an amnesty law approved last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savimbi had demanded a solemn proclamation of the amnesty, pardoning those who had taken up arms again over the past five years following a peace accord which failed to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end of the civil war with the Lusaka accords of November 1994 has failed to improve the standard of living of Angola's citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda, with its three million inhabitants, is overpopulated and dilapidated, with open sewers, crumbling streets and virtually no electric power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crime is rife, often involving the police and the army, poverty absolute, and tension high in the shanty suburbs, where police pounce on any sign of revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A German Catholic priest, Konrad Liebscher, was arrested last month for alleged offences against state security after calling on the government to raise wages, before being freed on June 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general of the ruling People's Liberation Movement (MPLA), Lopo do Nascimento, warned in an interview with the Portuguese weekly Visao last week of a military coup if things did not improve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new premier, Van Dunem, 61, is a lawyer by training, becoming a career diplomat in 1973 with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which he represented at the United Nations in Geneva from 1978-79.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1979 and 1982 he was Angola's ambassador to Belgium, the Netherlands and the European Community before becoming ambassador to Portugal, the former colonial power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1985 he was named Deputy Foreign minister, then Justice minister and Planning minister before becoming Speaker of Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Dunem has been given up to five days to form a new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the UN Security Council on May 8 renewed the mandate of the UN force in Angola for two months, but warned that the lack of cooperation by UNITA rebels could bring about the &quot;collapse&quot; of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In resolution 1055 adopted unanimously, the Security Council renewed the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III) until July 11, but expressed &quot;profound regret&quot; at the slow pace of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the disarmament operation began at the end of November under the peace accord, only 32,800 of the 63,000 UNITA troops have gone to the UN-supervised camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The fifth pan-African Children's Book Fair (PACBF) which opened its doors to the public on May 28 at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) here, ended on May 31, with most participants describing it as successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing participants during PACBF's closing ceremony, Mrs Elizabeth Masiga, the Chief Inspector of (Kenyan) Schools, commended both local and external publishers for &quot;the efforts you put in this exercise to make it a success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Masiga went on to say that the event &quot;is a significant development for our children as it will enhance and nurture the development of a reading habit among children at an early age.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-day fair which attracted more than 1,000 participants, was organised by the Nairobi-based Council for the Promotion of Children's Science Publications in Africa (CHISCI), with assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total of 19 countries, 12 of which came from Africa were represented at this year's fair. These among others include Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Others were France, Germany, and Philippines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pan-African Children's Book Fair is said to be &quot;the only full fledged regular book fair of international stature in the East and Central African region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various activities took place at the children's fair. One such event was UNESCO's launching of the Science for Africa Project (SAP). The launching of SAP, an activity of the Cultural Division of UNESCO, took the form of a one-and-a-half day seminar addressed by a number of experts from Japan, the Philippines, India and Colombia. The project is meant to encourage science writing of children's books by African authors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another highlight was a unique seminar duped &quot;Libraries Alive&quot;, meant mainly for teachers, parents and librarians. Its purpose was to &quot;develop strategies of making libraries attractive to children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of papers and case studies were presented by experts who work in this field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also featured was a children's reading tent. The children's reading tent gave children an opportunity to see all the books exhibited from Africa and the rest of the world as well as a chance to read as many as they could. The reading tent was visibly a favourite among children's activities, especially because of the dramatized story telling which went on in the tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing participants during the closing ceremony, Mrs Masiga noted that the most important African resource is the human resource of which children make about a half. She noted that &quot;children are a rich reservoir of skills and talents which we must start tapping now by giving children the ability to understand the environment around them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other activities which took place during the fair include a read-to- the-children-competition, a children's environment debate and a fun-with-science workshop which ran throughout the fair to exemplify its theme: Learning Science at an Early Age.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arusha, Tanzania - The first two Rwandans to appear before the UN tribunal trying suspects alleged to have carried out the 1994 ethnic genocide in Rwanda were formally charged here on May 30 and immediately pleaded not guilty to a total of 20 charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former militia leader George Rutaganda, 37, and former municipal leader Jean-Paul Akayesu, 43, appeared before the court in this northern Tanzanian town before their trials were adjourned until September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the May 30 hearings, which lasted less than 45 minutes each, an assistant to the court clerk read out eight charges against Rutaganda and 12 against Akayesu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charges, read in French, included genocide, crimes against humanity and murder.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rutaganda, who arrived amid tight security and was escorted by two police officers at the preliminary court set up in a room in the International Conference Centre in Arusha, from time to time smiled tensely, but showed little emotion as the charges were read to him, only shaking his head as he was accused of ordering Hutu militia to &quot;throw the Tutsis in the river.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former businessman, Rutaganda was second vice-president of the national committee of the Interahamwe -- literally &quot;youth section&quot; - which later became the feared Hutu militia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is accused of distributing arms to Hutu militiamen who allegedly used them to massacre men, women and children sheltered in a school near the Rwandan capital, Kigali. Rutaganda is further accused of ordering them to kill Tutsis and of himself taking part in the killings in various places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Interahamwe, who were often armed with machetes, lances or cudgels, are accused of the worst atrocities during the 1994 genocide which left at least 500,000 dead among the Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Court clerk Andronico Adede suggested the proper trial should begin in mid-August, but defence lawyer Luc de Temmerman told the court that would not give him sufficient time to prepare his defence, and asked for a visa for Rwanda, so that he can collect witness reports and &quot;examine the scene.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akayesu, who was mayor of Taba in the Gitarama district of central Rwanda, also appeared calm during the hearing and sat straight in his chair and took notes as he listened to the charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is accused of having incited genocide and of participating in murders and interrogation sessions that ended in torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A third suspect Clement Kayishema, the former local government chief in Kibuye south-western Rwanda where the massacre of minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates was particularly ferocious and systematic,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also appeared before the tribunal on May 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecution at the UN war crimes tribunal here said Clement Kayishema, a doctor by profession, had led a systematic campaign of genocide by allowing the massacre of people who had taken refuge in a church and sports stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema, 42, was the government's top representative in the Kibuye region of south-west Rwanda. It had one of the highest percentages of minority Tutsis of any region in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema did not appear troubled as the damning charges were read out to him, and grinned when the court clerk spoke of him firing the shot at the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by Judge Laity Kama after each charge whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty, he repeated 25 times in a confident voice: &quot;I plead not guilty, your honour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were 252,000 Tutsis in Kibuye before the 1994 civil war, but less than 8,000 afterwards, according to the human rights group, Africa Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another key Rwandan suspect, Colonel Theoneste Bagosara, who is accused of being one of the leading figures in the country's campaign of ethnic slaughter is expected to be moved soon from his Cameroon prison to await trial before the UN war crimes tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonel Bagosara would be transferred within two weeks to the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, where the tribunal is being held, his Belgian lawyer Luc de Temmerman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least another three Rwandans imprisoned in Cameroon, including Ferdinand Nahimana, one of the founders of the infamous Thousand Hills Radio, - Radio Milles Collines, would also be transferred with Colonel Bagosara to Arusha.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Rev. Njongonkulu Winston Ndungane, the Bishop of Kimberly and Kuruman in the Northern Cape, was elected late on June 4 as the new Archbishop of Cape Town to succeed retiring Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Tutu, 64, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, retires as head of the Anglican Church in Southern Africa next September, although he plans to take his sabbatical leave from church duties from the end of June, only three months away from his 65th birthday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He will continue to serve as chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the panel created to probe human rights abuses of South Africa's apartheid era. He is also President of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu was one of the most vocal critics of the former National Party regime's policies of racial separation and was the first black man to head the church, before winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndungane, 55 is the son of an Anglican priest who studied at King's College, London and served as assistant priest in several London parishes before returning to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He became Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman four-and-a-half years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before last week's elective assembly in Bishop's School in Rondebosch, Rev. Njongonkulu Ndungane and Bishop Duncan Buchanan had been proposed as the two candidates for the position of Archbishop of Cape Town and Head of the Province of Southern Africa. Bishop Buchanan is serving in Johannesburg, where Tutu also served as bishop before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church's elective assembly is made up of the three houses of bishops, clergy and laity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides South Africa, the church province includes Lesotho, Namibia,and St. Helena, Niassa and Lebombo in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier in the week on June 2, Archbishop Desmond Tutu gave a farewell communion service in a huge undercover sports arena here. Packed into the Good Hope Centre to say goodbye to the archbishop were 10,000 congregants, many of whom had been brought in with fleets of buses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two thousand choristers led the singing of hymns and psalms in English, Afrikaans and Xhosa, along with an organ, a group of instrumentalists and a marimba band, playing drums and the African xylophone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the centre reached its capacity, officials closed the doors, leaving several hundred would-be communicants pressing angrily against the glass outside. A number of unChristian remarks were passed, but eventually everyone was accommodated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of dancers performed a &quot;liturgical dance&quot; to the tune &quot;Africa is the place of the beating drum,&quot; and a lone ballerina in gypsy costume also danced &quot;God Bless Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Tutu praised God for His sense of humour in making a small man with a flat nose archbishop, and giving him a name which lent itself to graffiti. He cited one example: &quot;I was a Christian, until I put two and two together.&quot; And then mentioned a pop song, one line of which ran: &quot;Don't mess with my tutu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The archbishop also praised what he called God's sense of timing in allowing him to say farewell soon after South Africa became a fully democratic country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were those who were against apartheid. We were in the 'against mode'. Now we have to show much more clearly what we are for. We must change from the 'against mode' into the 'for mode',&quot; he said. &quot;So clearly we need a fresh, a vigorous and certainly a much younger leadership. A leader with a new vision for our church, which has sometimes appeared to be directionless,&quot; the archbishop said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What better time, he asked, to say: &quot;Bye-bye Tutu&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tributes were paid to the archbishop and to his wife, Leah, by representatives of the province, by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cape Town, Lawrence Henry, and presents were given by dioceses from around the province, including the sees of Namibia, Lesotho and Niassa and Lebombo in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PIETERSBURG - The recent exoneration of a Cuban anaesthetist in the death of four patients at Pieterburg Hospital by Northern Province health MEC Joe Phaahla flies in the face of an expert report he commissioned from the SA Society of Anaesthealologists (Sasa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Extracts of the confidential report, leaked to Mail &amp; Guardian this week expressed &quot;alarm&quot; at Dr L de la Parte's attitude to the deaths and found that his degree of competence was far below the level where he could work without constant expert supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phaahla claimed during television and press interviews that the Sasa report exonerated De La Parte and accused the media of &quot;picking on the deaths and sensationalising them to discredit the whole Cuban volunteer programme&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did, however, concede that the report was &quot;critical of some aspects of the management in the cases&quot; but refused to release the report for public debate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department insisted this week that the report was being kept confidential to protect the families of the deceased - so confidential that relatives have not been told the report finds that any civil action by them would &quot;probably be successful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial health department director general, Dr Nicholas Crisp, was even more blunt, saying that &quot;we don't make a practice of telling people they can sue us. We definitely don't see that as our obligation at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that the portions of the report leaked to M&amp;G dealing with the medical background of the patients were &quot;severely paraphrased&quot;, Crisp confirmed that the section dealing with Sasa's peer review committee findings were accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also confirmed that the report slated De La Parte for both his treatment of the patients and subsequent insistence that the patients had died &quot;because that were sick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were alarmed at his attitude. We found him to be arrogant, especially while making comments such as 'I am not worried, (about the deaths) as they were sick enough' and 'the surgeons were not well qualified',&quot; the report reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that all alternative treatment suggestions were &quot;fobbed off as being our British training whereas in Cuba things are done differently&quot; the report advised that evidence indicated a Medical and Dental Council disciplinary hearing would probably find De La Parte guilty of misconduct in all four cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report's four core recommendations expressly state that De La Parte cannot be permitted to continue practicing in South Africa without re-training and &quot;complete supervision&quot; at all times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting on the recommendations, Dr Crisp declined to renew De La Parte's contract with the department and told the anaesthetist not to bother returning to South Africa from a holiday in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phaahla told the media that De La Parte had returned to Cuba because of the stress created by sensationalistic press coverage and a subsequent nervous breakdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The review panel also voiced their support for Wits University Medical School professor, Dave Morell's original recommendations to the Medical Council that all foreign anaethetists be attached to large training hospitals for initial &quot;re-orientation&quot; before being placed in rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paatha's spokesman, Tshepo Moshima, consistently refused to give M&amp;G access to the MEC on Wednesday to explain the discrepancies between his public comments and the report's findings but insisted that Phaatha stood by his previous public statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why would his views have changed? If you look carefully, there are actually no discrepancies between the statements and the report. The MEC is not available on this issue and I speak for him,&quot; said Moshima.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did, however, concede that there were &quot;things that we need to still clarify on some points&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that the department had commissioned the report to ascertain whether &quot;the department is really taking care of lives&quot;, Moshima said that it had never been intended for public debate or for the families of the deceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That is just not the nature of the report - it is not meant for the families. It is true that we haven't advised them that the report says any civil action would probably be successful but the document is confidential,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in any case, we don't know whose duty it would have been to tell the families. Must administration or the MEC do this?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasa president, Dr Leon du Preez, agreed that the report had been confidential to protect the families' identities but stressed on Wednesday that they had to be informed that they had grounds for civil action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole case is now being investigated by the police to determine whether there are grounds for an inquest, as recommended in our report, but is essential for the families to at least know that they could sue for damages,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Du Preez and Crisp repeatedly stressed that the issue that De La Parte was Cuban had focused undue attention on the incident and that it was &quot;unfortunately discrediting the very good work being done here by brilliant Cuban surgeons and doctors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming that there had been at least 12 anaesthestic deaths at Pietersburg Hospital during the same period as the four cases involving De La Parte, Crisp said that the department had instituted new strict monitoring procedures to review all future deaths immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you saw the number of patients who are classified as dying 'anaesthetic deaths' in South Africa, you'd be surprised. It's masses of people but there are often other factors involved. We all recognise that this is not a well managed service but the new measures we have instituted and a new national study to determine exact figures and causes will give us a better handle on the situation,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new protocol for anaesthetic deaths developed by MEDUNSA's department of forensic death and a proposed national pilot study by Sasa will, Crisp, insists improve the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police investigating the deaths of those at Pieterburg Hospital are still collecting affidavits for the Attorney General but feel that there is sufficient evidence to justify a full Inquest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Crisp, a government to government agreement between Cuba and South Africa ensures that De La Parte will be brought back should he be required to &quot;answer questions&quot;. It is unclear whether this would also apply for a civil case by the relatives of his alleged victims.</SPAN></P>
