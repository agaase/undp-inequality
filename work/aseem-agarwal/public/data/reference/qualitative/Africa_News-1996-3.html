<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Ibrahim Dasuki, deposed April 20 as Sultan of Sokoto, Nigeria's supreme Muslim leader, has been charged in court for alleged inability to repay debts owed two failed banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disgraced cleric is facing trial with 15 other directors of two firms which allegedly owed the collapsed Alpha Merchant and Republic Banks some 775 million naira (about 35.23 million U.S. dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dasuki was deposed and banished by the military government. It accused him of financial impropriety and showing disrespect to the administration of Gen. Sani Abacha. Dasuki has been replaced by Muhammadu Maccido.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dasuki was absent when the debt recovery trial opened Wednesday at the Lagos zone of the failed bank tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His attorney, Chimeje Ikeazor, told the tribunal he had no access to his client, believed banished to Nigeria's northeastern city of Jalingo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lawyer said he was prepared to defend his client provided he could be produced in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal chairman, Justice Musiliu Ope-Agbe, then adjoured the case until July 10. The judge ordered that the deposed sultan be produced in court on that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least seven chief executives of failed Nigerian banks have been jailed by the tribunal, in a move the military government said was to sanitise the country's financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also said that a failed government parastatals tribunal is to be established to try officials who mismanaged graft-ridden state-run agencies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a Bank of Tanzania (BOT) report, recurrent expenditure since the beginning of the 1995-1996 fiscal year in July stood at 350.4 billion shs. compared with an expenditure of 379.1 billion or deficit of 28.7 billion shs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report, issued here Wednesday, said that cumulative collection for March and April was 83.8 billion shs, which is above the benchmark by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), set at 82.5 billion shs. for the period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trend should be sustained to facilitate the commencement of a formal IMF-sponsored Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in the next financial year under which multilateral donors would inject more aid into the country,&quot; the BOT report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added that inflation decreased slightly from 26 percent in March to 25.5 percent in April as food prices went down but drinks, rent and tobacco prices increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since President Benjamin Mkapa came to power in November, 1995, Tanzania has been recording good revenue collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, several donor countries have resumed their assistance to the country which were suspended because of poor revenue collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mkapa has made it clear that revenue collection will be strengthened. A new institution, the Tanzania Revenue authority is expected to start operations in July.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TEMA, Ghana - The Tema Oil Refinery (TOR) in Ghana has announced that it plans to liberalise the importation of crude oil and petroleum products within the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision, which forms part of the government's energy reform program, will remove the monopoly from the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), which had hitherto been the sole importer of crude oil and petroleum products in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Parker, TOR Chief Executive, told reporters Tuesday that the procurement of crude and refined oil products, required to make up for the refinery's shortfall, will be through competitive tenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil companies will be given a chance to import these inputs and share the cost, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said profit margins for the oil marketing companies will be set and reviewed to ensure that there are no undue price hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parker said TOR advertised the new policy as a first step towards achieving the regulation and restructuring of the oil industry in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said tenders will be based on open competition aimed at obtaining the best price. &quot;It will be certainly transparent&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deregulation, he explained, &quot;is essentially an attempt to ensure full cost recovery based on current crude prices and exchange rates as well as full processing costs and not tax importation gimmick.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parker said changes in ex-refinery prices and corresponding maximum retail price will be posted as soon as significant changes occur in the cost element.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said over 30 oil companies and businesses which are supposed to prove their technical and financial capabilities, experience, ability to supply and their bankers, have put in applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana currently consumes some 1.8 million tonnes of crude a year, while the refinery has the capacity to process 1.2 million tonnes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria has requested a change of venue for a planned meeting with the British-led Commonwealth, from which it was suspended in November 1995 over its human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria was suspended from the 53-nation organization following the Nov.  1995 execution for murder of nine minority leaders, among them author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hangings provoked international condemnation and sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abuja protested the suspension and refused a visit to the country by the eight-nation Commonwealth ministerial action group set up to monitor the democratioc process and human rights in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After its recent meeting in London the group, chaired by Zimbabwe, decided to invite Nigeria to a meeting in London, the British capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nigeria Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said in a letter to the group chairman, Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge, that Abuja would prefer an alternative venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wish to remind in this connection that the United Kingdom at present maintains a regime of sanctions against my country which includes restriction of high level visits or contacts with Nigerian officials,&quot; Ikimi added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said unless it could be assured that &quot;my delegation would have unfettered movement to and from the United Kingdom, an alternative country could be proposed for our mutual consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Britain is among European Union countries that have imposed sanctions, including visa restrictions, sports ban and freezing of official assistance to Nigeria over the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Ikimi said Nigeria welcomes the move by the Commonwealth to recognise that Nigeria &quot;is entitled to justice and fair play on this matter as we believe that our suspension was both unprecedented and undemocratic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ikimi, who Wednesday received a special message from Mudenge, said the Commonwealth move would pave way for &quot;constructive dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.S. diplomat told PANA in Lagos Thursday that Shattuck, the first top American official to visit Nigeria in several months, arrived late Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Details of his itinenary or the duration of the trip were not immediately available. It was also unclear if he would be meeting military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington has maintained limited sanctions it imposed on Nigeria after the annulment by the last military regime of the June 1993 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also called for the release of opposition politicians, including millionaire-politician Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the cancelled presidential poll. Abiola is facing trial for treasonable felony after he declared himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. government has also condemned the November 1995 executions for murder of nine Nigerian minority leaders, among them author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In several recent statements, Washington has indicated its displeasure at the Abacha regime's politicial transition to democracy and human rights posture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State department officials have maintained that the U.S. does not rule out any further sanctions against Nigeria, including oil embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. ambassador in Nigeria Walter Carrington, recalled home for four months over the executions, returned to his post in April, saying his resumption of duty did not amount to a change in Washington's position on Nigeria's human rights and democractic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But independent observers say Washington and its European partners are hamstrung on the measure because of their interests in Nigeria's petroleum industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An oil embargo could hurt the U.S., which buys some 50 percent of Nigeria's crude.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUJUMBURA, Burundi - U.S. Deputy Secretary of State for African Affairs George Moose arrived Thursday in Bujumbura on a one-day visit to once again try to find a solution to the Burundi crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moose, accompanied by his country's special coordinator for Rwanda and Burundi, Richard Bogosian, did not rule out the possibility of spending more time in the country &quot;if the need arises&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The United States has not planned a military intervention in Burundi&quot;, he said, adding that his country was therefore &quot;ready to bring an emergency aid (to Burundi), in case of a humanitarian disaster&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The American delegation will meet President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo as well as the defence minister and other officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation's arrival coincided with a statement by the opposition UPRONA party in which it rejected any call by the international community to send foreign troops into Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The current international campaign for a foreign troop intervention in Burundi, is unacceptable and abuse of our national sovereignty&quot; said UPRONA, (Unity for National Progress), the former sole party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the statement, &quot;UPRONA will not...accept the international community to reduce to nothing the more than 30 years of freedom and sovereignty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It recalled that &quot;Burundi political partners reaffirmed their determination to defend the national sovereignty, particularly by refusing any foreign political or military interference in national affairs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If by any chance the military intervention occured, &quot;the party would not fail to call on the Burundi people to oppose resolutely the invasion&quot;, warned UPRONA in the statement signed by its chairman, Charles Mukasi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi has been hit by ethnic and political violence which killed an estimated 500,000 people since the democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, was assassinated in the October 1993 failed coup.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Tuesday's ferry disaster on Lake Victoria and the revolt by some soldiers of the Central African Republic army, strained relations among the countries of the Great Lakes and Liberia's ongoing crisis, drew sharp responses from newspapers in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala's state-owned daily, The New Vision, said that despite officials denials of overloading of the ferry the contrary appeared to be case.  &quot;Should this turn out to be true, then the authorities in Tanzania should have a more critical look at the whole transport industry and take corrective action,&quot; it said.  &quot;This, of course, does not apply to Tanzania alone. Most countries in the region, Uganda inclusive, have been losing hundreds of their people in accidents on the roads, in the air and on water,&quot; it said. &quot;In most cases the accusing finger points to laxity in the enforcement of safety standards.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The profit motive, it said, was why vehicles were not serviced correctly, or frequently in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Often, it added, public transport that are too old &quot;are kept on the roads, in the air and on the lakes, hoping that God's mercy will keep them afloat.&quot; The result, it said, was &quot;countless accidents.&quot; Whatever the cause of the ferry accident, it said, &quot;the casualty rate has exposed our nakedness in our inability to handle disasters of this nature.&quot; Dakar's Sud Quotidien commented on the army revolt in Central African Republic: Evidence, it said, of &quot;kaki (military) contamination&quot; of Africa's democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is in reference to the resurgence of military governments and revolts on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The crisis in Central Africa underlines the degree to which the quiet giant (the army) has impeded the democratic process which she has still not yet accepted,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L' Observateur, a Bujumbura newspaper in strife-torn Burundi, commented on the strained relations among Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire. It said the situation could lead to war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, the problem between Burundi and Zaire was one of &quot;a crisis of confidence.&quot; This, it said, stemmed from &quot;the (uninterupted) 30-year presidency of Mobutu Sese Seko and the relative instability of the Burundian president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, it said, the relations between Mobutu and Burundi's first president, Michel Micombero, which was forged out of a common background and generation, &quot;no longer prevails.&quot; Instead, it said, &quot;a pyschological crisis&quot; exists between both countries. Mobutu, it said, &quot;opposed democracy&quot; as decided at the Francophone summit at La Baule while Burundi &quot;rushed into this endless labyrinth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its relations with Rwanda, the newspaper added: &quot;Kinshasa is increasingly disturbed by the presence of a regime in Kigali which owes it nothing and whose example might be followed in Bujumbura, because of imperialism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government-owned Zambia Daily Mail, published in Lusaka, and the Lagos-based National Concord, a private newspaper, were dismayed by Liberia's warlords and the country's recent boat people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The most enduring lesson of the Bulk Challenge saga is that governments in countries of the West African sub-region should intensiify efforts aimed at ending the Liberian civil war,&quot; the Concord said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otherwise, it said, &quot;fall-outs in terms of unwanted refugees and threats to peace and stability in neighbouring countries will remain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it added, while the crisis lasts &quot;no government in the West African sub-region -- not least Nigeria's -- should attempt to bury its head in the sands by keeping out those who have chosen to flee that country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It concluded: &quot;Perhaps, a swarm of refugees from Liberia is all the rest of West Africa needs to drive home the message that whatever it takes, the war in Liberia must be brought to an end one way or the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail said events in Liberia &quot;are outright shameful and disgusting,&quot; to say the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is most saddening to note that while countries in the West African region are trying to grapple with their economic problems, these are being derailed by developments in Liberia,&quot; it continued.  This situation needs to be redressed, it added, so that these countries could attend to their internal problems.  &quot;This is the same message that must go out to other hot spots such as Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and, to some extent, Sudan, where those supposed to be leading the people are at loggerheads over petty issues,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the newspaper disagreed with those who have called for extra-continental bodies to solve this and other African problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa has now reached a stage whereby she doesn't need the so-called superpowers to resolve her problems. That would be tantamount to recolonialisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African problems must be addressed by the African governments themselves through the Organisation of African Unity and not through the intervention of other powers,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote D'ivoire - Hopes that the African Development Bank, the continent's premier lending institution will be infused with new capital under its new management are gradually diminishing as Western financiers increasingly adopt a beggar-my-neighbour attitude to the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance ministers and bank governors from the 53 African members and 24 other member countries have been locked in endless discussion for two days over the replenishment of the Bank's soft loan affiliate, the African Development Fund (ADF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ADF, the source of investment funds for 39 African members was due for the seventh three-year replenishment way back in 1993, but its share holders said they would not do so until the Bank's operations were restructured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;house cleaning&quot; they asked for was initiated at the beginning of the year by its new president, Omar Kabbaj of Morocco, who replaced Babacar Ndiaye of Senegal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabbaj told the governors the exercise, which involves complete overhaul of the institution's methods of work, has seen the removal of more than 200 staff of all catergories. Many others have been down-graded, redeployed or merely asked to seek early retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the ADB has also set up safety nets for proper loan management and recovery of arreas, which was among the demands made by the donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But deliberations underway here, ahead of the 32nd annual general meeting of the Bank opening Wednesday, indicate that if anything, the ADF may only get a pittance, assuming the financiers finally agree on anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndiaye in 1993 said at least the amount should be within the range of five billion dollars for the Bank to be able to tackle some of the pressing development needs of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But source here told PANA Tuesday delegates were yet to agree on about half the amount -- some 2.5 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Two-and-a-half years in too long,&quot; said Zhand Zhxiang of the Chinese delegation which has so far been sympathetic to the African cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conference sources say the two major financiers to the ADF --- the United States and Japan -- plan to cut their shareholdings in the Fund. This means reduced contributions for the replenishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. contributions would go down from 11.8 percent to 10 percent, while the Japanese contributions would move from 9.5 percent to just six percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canada says it wants to reduce its eight percent share by half. Sweden says it would cut half-percentage point from its share of 4.5 percent, if Britain does not promise to do more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Italy is yet to clear some 300 million dollars in arrears due to the Fund, while Germany claims it has problems with its parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say almost all traditional donors have found one excuse or the other not to put in sufficient funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They say the influence of the Bank on African development would diminish considerably if the ADF continues to be starved of funds. This is because it is the primary source of investment capital for the majority (39) of the African members who do not qualify for costly loans from the adb loan window, especially at a time when official development aid has shrunk to the barest minimum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ADF was established in 1972, nine years after the ADB, to provide development finance on concessional terms to low-income African Countries.  Its loans are interest-free (0.75 percent service charge) and are generally repayable over 50 years including a grace period of 10 years. The last replenishment was 3.34 billion dollars. It share subscription at the end of 1995 was 11.45 billion dollas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By comparison the ABD, with a subscribed capital of 24 billion dollars at the end of last year, charges seven percent interest on its loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third arm of the Bank group is the Nigeria Trust Fund, floated by Nigeria in 1976 to support needy African members. The fund, which charges four percent interest on loans, has grown from 80 million dollars at inception to 440 million dollars today.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KHARTOUM, Sudan - A privately-owned Sudanese daily newspaper was ordered closed for two weeks Tuesday after it published a report of a mutiny in a regional prison in which it said soldiers were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan's National Council for the Press and Publications said Arrai Al Akhar (The Other View), was being shut because it had violated the Press and Publications Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This law prohibits the publication of news that could be harmful to the national security or which offends or demoralises the armed forces of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper reported Friday that 95 soldiers, jailed for their involvement in an attempted coup in March 1995, had led a revolt at Eddewaim prison in the state of White Nile, some 180 kilometres south of Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said they clashed with prison guards before taking over the facility and holding its commander, a major, hostage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper quoted what it called an authoritative source as saying the mutineers &quot;had occupied the prison and its arms depot after a bloody clash inside the prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudanese authorities said that a small number of army officers and men had taken part in a failed coup, meant to prevent a return to civil government. This coincided with the presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Ministry of the Interior denied Saturday the newspaper's claim that soldiers were involved in the reported prison takeover. The ministry termed the disturbances as unrest caused by ordinary inmates who complained of inadequate rations and recreation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Press and Publications Council said the newspaper's account contained lies. It said none of the former soldiers took part in the disturbances and that the prison was neither taken over nor its weapons seized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council said the newspaper had failed to publish the ministry's denial of the account, as had all other media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper's editor-in-chief, Mohi Eddin Titawi, said Monday that his publication's account of the prison incident was true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that armed men, whom he could not identify, stormed his office Sunday and took away 20,000 copies of the newspaper that were ready for distribution. They also took away all the blue prints. He said he was expecting to be arrested at any moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the general-secretary of the influential Press Union, Abdul Malik Annaeim told reporters Monday the body would do its utmost to prevent Titwani's arrest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The port's commandant, Ben Acholonu, said Tuesday the ship brought 46 passengers including 27 nigerian troops who are members of Ecomog, the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Ecomog soldiers had been cleared and left for home, while the 19 civilian passengers were being detained by the port security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acholonu said the civilians were made up of 16 Liberians, two Guineans and one Sierra Leonean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West Africans, who claimed they were traders and refused to disembark in Ghana where more than 1,500 Liberian refugees disembarked, were being held for screening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rickety Bulk Challenge acquired notoriety for the long journey and her human cargo, most of whom were fleeing renewed fighting in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian parliament Wednesday expelled an opposition member of parliament, Akashambatwa Mbikisuta Lewanika, for alleged gross contempt and breach of its privileges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewanika belongs to the National Party (NP), which together with the United Independence Party of former president Kenneth Kaunda, have 26 members of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anouncing the expulsion, the speaker of parliament, told the house his exclusion was recommended by the standing orders committee, following Lewanika's letter which he cast aspersions on the integrity of the house.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his letter, written last March, Lewanika had disassociated himself from what he termed as &quot;the deeply shameful&quot; and &quot;grossly unjust persecution of &quot;Post&quot; newspaper editors and a columnist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wrote the letter after parliament had sentenced the three to an indifinite jail term for contempt of the house, through their articles published last January. They were released in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nabulyato said the standing orders committee took great exception to the accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewanika's said in his letter that he &quot;laid his hands off any association with acts related to the deeply shameful and grossly unjust persecution&quot; of the three journalists by parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Nabulyato &quot;the assertions were derogatory to the dignity of the house and inconsistent with the standards which parliament was entitled to expect from members of parliament and have resolved that the honourable member (Mbikusita Lewanika) be expelled from the services of the house for the rest of the life of this parliament forthwith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Lewanika had been given seven hours within which to show cause why he should not be subjected to the disciplinary proceedings of the house for his affront to the collective decision of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbikusita Lewanika is member for Mongu in the politically conservative western region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the expelled member of parliament walked out, members of the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) shouted &quot;shame, shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbikusita Lewanika's expulsion became the third of its kind in the history of the Zambian parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first was in 1968, four years after independence, when a member of the white Federal Party, Robert Malcomson, was &quot;disciplined&quot; for making racial slurs on African members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had said something to the effect that &quot;Africans had been jumping from tree to tree not long ago,&quot; a reference to members of the then ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP) and the now defunct African National Congress (ANC) of the late Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second occured in 1970 when a veteran freedom fighter and nationalist, the late Mungoni Liso of the ANC, alleged that Kaunda's government had wasted money to hire concubines for leaders attending a Commonwealth meeting in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several other members of parliament have been suspended in the past for various &quot; less serious&quot; offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of them, a UNIP member, is still under suspension for allegedly lying to the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbikusita Lewanika loses his emoluments, rights and privileges as a result of the expulsion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is an outspoken critic of president Frederick Chiluba's government in which he was a cabinet minister until 1993 when he resigned, after accusing his cabinet colleagues of corruption and drug-trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, Mbikusita Lewanika attacked the constitution amendment law which sought to bar some citizens from contesting the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He termed the document as a &quot;chameleon and animal farm&quot; type political deception which had no backing of the Zambian majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amendment became law on Wednesday with an overwhelming 119-0 vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbikusita Lewanika is a member member of the Barotse royal establishment in Western Zambia, where some traditionalists are reportedly campaigning for secession from the rest of Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian parliament Wednesday unanimously voted to enact a new constitution law that will bar former president Kenneth Kaunda and other Zambians whose parents were not born in Zambia from becoming president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the new law, only Zambian citizens with both parents born in Zambia or are of Zambian descent will be eligible to run for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also bans citizens who have held the office twice before from becoming president. Traditional chiefs have also been banned from active partisan politics unless they resign their traditional posts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other qualifications for the office of the president include attainment of the age of 35, membership of or sponsorship of a political party and good character.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new requirement in the amended constitution is that the presidential candidate should have been domiciled in Zambia for a period of at least 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda had Malawian parents and held office for 27 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba is expected to sign the bill in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the 119 members of parliament belonging to the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of president Frederick Chiluba voted in favour.  The two opposition parties represented in the house, Kaunda's United National Independence Party and the National Party, walked out of the house during voting time. There were no abstentions and votes against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill has been described by the opposition, civil society organisations and other critics as discriminatory and a recipe for possible civil strife in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition Zambia Democratic Congress(ZDC), led by Dean Mung'omba, had earlier this year petitioned Zambian courts to rule against parliament's enactment of the constitutional amendment. An alliance of opposition parties opposed to the constitution last week said they would support the ZDC legal action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba Wednesday told Zambia national radio that his party would pursue all peaceful means to stop implementation of the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He accused the ruling party of tailoring the country's supreme law to suit its own political expediency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba recently took the constitutional debate to his MMD-dominated parliament in defiance of local and international calls to have it adopted by a constituent assembly in order to achieve wider consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling party has some 131 members of parliament in the 158-seat assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote D'Ivoire - Non-regional shareholders of the African Development Bank have approved 1.6 billon U.S. dollars for the long-delayed replenishment of the African Development Fund, the concessional window of the continental finance institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amount falls short of the 2.5 billion delegates had been trying to win in two-days of debate, ahead of the bank's 32nd annual general meeting which starts Wednesday in the Ivoirian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But representatives of the 24 non-regional members said another one billion dollars, to be derived from the recycling of previous loans and money from unsubscribed shares, would be made available to bring the total to 2.6 billion dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegates, who are finance ministers and central bank governors, made the decision late Tuesday. They said the amount would be used &quot;to support projects and programmes designed to reduce poverty and promote sound economic policy in the poorest countries of Africa through 1998.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fund is supposed to be replenished every three years. The seventh replenishment was due in 1993. At the time, the former president of the bank, Babacar Ndiaye, estimated that the fund would require at least five billion dollars to be able to meet growing demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-regional states from the Americas, Asia, Caribbean, Europe and the Middle East held up replenishment of the fund until the bank carried out reforms and improved its management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new bank president, Omar Kabbaj of Morocco, had since initiated reforms. These include the removal of 20 percent of the staff across the board, reorganization of work methods and the improvement of its debt recovery mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegates said Wednesday they welcomed the &quot;wide-ranging reforms underway in the bank to refocus its activities on priority needs and improve institutional efficiency and development impact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Specifically, they cited the &quot;sharpened institutional focus on human resource development, a far-reaching reorganization, adoption of a range of important financial reforms, including lending policies linked explicitly to borrower creditworthiness, and major steps to improve portfolio performance and address areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 53 African members of the bank group 39 have failed to qualify for loans from the bank and have sourced interest-free investmant loans from the fund.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI, Kenya - A controversial Kenyan AIDS drug researcher, Prof.Arthur Othieno Obel, has said he is working on a vaccine against HIV/AIDS and that this time he intends to conform to scientific conventions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview published by a Nairobi paper, the Sunday Standard, the reseacher said he expects the vaccine to be ready &quot;in the next six months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two months ago, Obel announced through the media that he had discovered an anti-AIDS treatment known as Pearl Omega.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, he has received a barrage of criticism from his professional colleagues, as well as support from non-scientists and leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obel told the Sunday Standard that in his new research, titled &quot;Research Protocol on Proposed Development of AIDS Virus Vaccine&quot;, he intends to collaborate with institutions of repute to attain his goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a hope that this vaccine, which will first be tried on Guinea pigs, will provide a lasting solution to the AIDS menace,&quot; said the researcher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obel said his proposal aims at eliminating HIV and AIDS from the face of the earth, as was the case with polio and typhoid among other previously catastrophic diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obel, chief government scientist in the office of the president, predicted that AIDS would be a thing of the past come the year 2,000. He however did not reveal the steps he was taking to manufacture the vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The steps are very demanding in terms of both resources and brain work.  This is a top notch exercise which I hope will succeed as the theoretical aspects of it appear logical and the rationale behind the work currently is foolproof,&quot; he told the Sunday paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obel said the vaccine should be undergoing phase zero studies within the next three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board said Sunday that it was not after the formula of Prof Obel's Pearl Omega drug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board's chairman, Richrd Baraza, said his organzation was not interested in Obel's formula but wanted its efficacy established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, the board and the Kenya national AIDS committee summoned Obel to explain his unconventionally introduced drug. However, both meetings have been abruptly called off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Detractors accuse him of not following scientific protocol while supporters insist that the embattled reseacher's drug should not be villified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Obel announced the drug, his clinic at Commonwealth House in the Kenyan capital has reportedly witnessed an endless stream of patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On Friday, my Commonwealth House international medical foundation offices were packed with patients from London, Brazil Botswana and Nigeria, just to name a few,&quot; Obel told journalists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ferry's captain, Reuben Rume, said he communicated with Mwanza Port at 7.30 a.m. and reported the ship's condition as safe. He told the port he would dock in Mwanza at 8 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A crew member of another ferry coming from Uganda, the MV Butiama, said the ship capsized a few minutes after 7.30 a.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Butiama's captain radioed Mwanza of the accident and stayed near the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has announced three days of mourning beginning today. Flags will fly at half mast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - Tuesday's ferry disaster on Lake Victoria and the revolt by some soldiers of the Central African Republic army, strained relations among the countries of the Great Lakes and Liberia's ongoing crisis, drew sharp responses from newspapers in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala's state-owned daily, The New Vision, said that despite officials denials of overloading of the ferry the contrary appeared to be case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Should this turn out to be true, then the authorities in Tanzania should have a more critical look at the whole transport industry and take corrective action,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This, of course, does not apply to Tanzania alone. Most countries in the region, Uganda inclusive, have been losing hundreds of their people in accidents on the roads, in the air and on water,&quot; it said. &quot;In most cases the accusing finger points to laxity in the enforcement of safety standards.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The profit motive, it said, was why vehicles were not serviced correctly, or frequently in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Often, it added, public transport that are too old &quot;are kept on the roads, in the air and on the lakes, hoping that God's mercy will keep them afloat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result, it said, was &quot;countless accidents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the cause of the ferry accident, it said, &quot;the casualty rate has exposed our nakedness in our inability to handle disasters of this nature.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar's Sud Quotidien commented on the army revolt in Central African Republic: Evidence, it said, of &quot;kaki (military) contamination&quot; of Africa's democratic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is in reference to the resurgence of military governments and revolts on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The crisis in Central Africa underlines the degree to which the quiet giant (the army) has impeded the democratic process which she has still not yet accepted,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> L' Observateur, a Bujumbura newspaper in strife-torn Burundi, commented on the strained relations among Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire. It said the situation could lead to war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, the problem between Burundi and Zaire was one of &quot;a crisis of confidence.&quot; This, it said, stemmed from &quot;the (uninterupted) 30-year presidency of Mobutu Sese Seko and the relative instability of the Burundian president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, it said, the relations between Mobutu and Burundi's first president, Michel Micombero, which was forged out of a common background and generation, &quot;no longer prevails.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, it said, &quot;a pyschological crisis&quot; exists between both countries. Mobutu, it said, &quot;opposed democracy&quot; as decided at the Francophone summit at La Baule while Burundi &quot;rushed into this endless labyrinth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its relations with Rwanda, the newspaper added: &quot;Kinshasa is increasingly disturbed by the presence of a regime in Kigali which owes it nothing and whose example might be followed in Bujumbura, because of imperialism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government-owned Zambia Daily Mail, published in Lusaka, and the Lagos-based National Concord, a private newspaper, were dismayed by Liberia's warlords and the country's recent boat people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The most enduring lesson of the Bulk Challenge saga is that governments in countries of the West African sub-region should intensiify efforts aimed at ending the Liberian civil war,&quot; the Concord said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Otherwise, it said, &quot;fall-outs in terms of unwanted refugees and threats to peace and stability in neighbouring countries will remain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, it added, while the crisis lasts &quot;no government in the West African sub-region -- not least Nigeria's -- should attempt to bury its head in the sands by keeping out those who have chosen to flee that country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It concluded: &quot;Perhaps, a swarm of refugees from Liberia is all the rest of West Africa needs to drive home the message that whatever it takes, the war in Liberia must be brought to an end one way or the other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail said events in Liberia &quot;are outright shameful and disgusting,&quot; to say the least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is most saddening to note that while countries in the West African region are trying to grapple with their economic problems, these are being derailed by developments in Liberia,&quot; it continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This situation needs to be redressed, it added, so that these countries could attend to their internal problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the same message that must go out to other hot spots such as Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and, to some extent, Sudan, where those supposed to be leading the people are at loggerheads over petty issues,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the newspaper disagreed with those who have called for extra-continental bodies to solve this and other African problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa has now reached a stage whereby she doesn't need the so-called superpowers to resolve her problems. That would be tantamount to recolonialisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African problems must be addressed by the African governments themselves through the Organization of African Unity and not through the intervention of other powers,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi's Daily Nation was critical of the new Zambian law passed by parliament which bars Zambians whose parents were born outside the country from contesting the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So Kenneth Kaunda, who was the country's first president, can no longer try for another term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are concerned about what has happened in Zambia because it has happened here in Kenya, in neighboring Uganda and in several other African countries previously and will happen in the future as long as there are politicians who would rather use or misuse the law to keep their opponents away from their political mainstream,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast - The 32nd annual general meeting of the African Development Bank ended in Abidjan Thursday, with a commitment by its share holders to do everything to put the continent's premier financial institution on a sound footing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance ministers and central bank governors, representing 53 African countries and 24 non-African countries, said they were happy that after two years of near stalemate the bank was now in a position to move forward, due to the 2.6 billion dollars promised by donors for the 7th replenishment of the ADB, from which 39 African countries source investment funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABD president, Omar Kabbaj, told journalists at a press briefing that the African Development Fund (ADF) should be able to resume consideration of loan applications as from June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he warned : &quot;We are going to work more like a bank than a humanitarian organization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabbaj said both Africa and the bank will now move from stagnation to growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said non-regional governors would meet in Osaka next month, at the instance of Japan, to consider additional contributions to the ADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New contributions plus the new replenishment should make it possible for the ADF and the ADB loan windows to provide loans amounting to about 2.2 billion dollars a year. This would be some 800 million dollars lower than the amount the bank could give out in its hey-days, but not too bad considering that the Asian Development Bank which is operating under more favorable economic conditions disburses some four billion dollars in loans annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kabbaj also stressed the need for the African members of the bank to pay up arrears amounting to 800 million dollars. He said non-payment of these arrears, owed by some 25 countries could harm the credit rating of the bank, which has so far been good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of arrears will be a major topic on the agenda of a meeting called by Gabonese President Omar Bongo, for July 6-7 in Libreville for African leaders.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MBABANE, Swaziland - Some 200 employees of the South African construction company, N.D. Engineering, building a giant pulp company in Swaziland went on strike Thursday over a pay dispute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Witnesses said the strikers, armed with iron bars, sticks and lengths of timber, prevented some 700 other local and expatriate workers employed by other contractors from entering the project site after their lunch break.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Usutu Pulp Companay security guards stood by but did not intervene.  There were several angry verbal exchanges between the strikers and other workers but no violent incidents were reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action began following a lunchtime meeting by Swazi casual workers and company officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project is a 200-million-rand (45.66 million U.S. dollars) expansion works at the Usutu Pulp Company at Bhunya, Western Swaziland. The firm is operated by the South African Company, Sappi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Work throughout the rest of Usutu Company premises, including the mill not connected with the expansion contract site, continued through the afternoon uninterrupted. No comment could be obtained from the contractors up to late Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Usutu Pulp Company is one of the stongholds of the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions. It has called for nationwide worker stayaways over the past 12 months. The union's aim is to pressure the non-party Swaziland government to meet 27 labour and political demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior Usutu Pulp Company official expressed fear Thursday that unless the isolated dispute between the particular contractor company and its local workers is resolved speedily, sympathy strike action within the Usutu Pulp Company could result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, a resumption of industrial unrest and mass action by the trade unions is the last thing the government wants at this crucial time. That is because King Mswati is rounding off a two-week trade promotion trip to Kuwait and mainland China in an effort to attract badly needed foreign investors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa has unveiled a master plan to combat high crime levels that are threatening foreign confidence and investment in the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new National Crime Prevention Strategy -- approved Thursday by the cabinet -- was unveiled by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. It will concentrate on a new approach, switching police action from crime control to crime prevention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is public knowledge that our democratic government inherited a terrible legacy from our past, of which crime is just one aspect,&quot; Mbeki said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is South Africa's first comprehensive national plan to crack crime in the country. Several government departments will work together to eliminate seven main areas of crime: firearms, organiszed crime, white collar crime, gender violence, violence and crime against children, violence resulting from inter-group conflict, and vehicle theft and hijacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plan has been unanimously endorsed by South Africa's main political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress described the strategy as &quot;a quantum leap forward in the ongoing fight against crime&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party leader and outgoing deputy president, Frederik De Klerk, Said: &quot;Crime and violence have been hanging like a dark shadow over our country for much too long.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His party, he said, supported the plan but would watch over its implementation like a hawk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi also endorsed the plan, saying he would do everything in his power as Home Affairs Minister to promote it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Support has also come from the South African business sector, whose Business Against Crime Organization describes the new initiative as &quot;a major step towards a coherent government approach on the prevention of crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The anti-crime document says the plan represents a turning point in the battle against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The strategy is based on the view that we need to build a new society, rather than simply normalise something which was never normal,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenya sent 16 naval officers to Mwanza Friday to help recover bodies from a sunken ferry near this Tanzania port city on Lake Victoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Daniel Arap Moi said in Nairobi that the officers, from the Kenya Navy, were experienced in rescue and retrieval operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another team of Kenyan divers arrived in Mwanza Thursday and immediately set out to the scene of the accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official of the Tanzania Red Cross, Msafari Luhega, was quoted as saying that the Kenyans were well equipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know things will now move faster,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marine salvage experts from Kenya's sea port city of Mombasa are also on site. They were called by Tanzania to help retrieve the ferry, the M.V.  Bukoba, which sank Tuesday with 661 people aboard and about eight kilometres short of its destination. Rescuers say 114 of these were saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A two-man crew from Divecon, a company which specialises in underwater cutting equipment, left Mombasa Thursday for the disaster site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team helped salvage Kenya's M.V. Mtongwe, a ferry that capsized in Mombasa in 1994 killing hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another Kenyan Salvage Company, Murri International, has offered to help.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Ndu Nwike, a lawyer who lives at Ejigbo, a Lagos suburb, was entertaining business associates and friends in his sitting room when armed robbers stormed his apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within minutes, the bandits ransacked the house, taking away valuables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nwike's terrified guests were not spared. The robbers took away their watches, jewels and other personal effects.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to losing his gold watch, one guest received matchet cuts for &quot;not having money,&quot; on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The robbers fled in a car they had snatched in the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This incident sent shock waves in the neighborhood. Although neighbors reported the robbery to the police, the robbers were never caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar robberies are common in Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub, with an estimated six million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To protect themselves, residents have resorted to erecting gates at the entrance to their streets. Almost every street has one or more gates which are locked or unlocked at specified periods during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The gates are serving their purposes, although robbers still manage to gain entry into some areas,&quot; says Vincent Beassingar, who mans a street gate in Okota, an outskirt of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Armed robbers are now afraid to raid areas with gates because of the risk of getting stuck, and the residents are happier for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ime Eze, a supermarket owner agrees that the gates have effectively checked the activities of night marauders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If anything, the theft of vehicles packed in their owners' compounds at night has been reduced to the barest minimum as a result of the gates,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is becoming a security risk for one to live in an area without the gates, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not every Lagos resident is comfortable with the street gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While not denying their usefulness in crime prevention, critics see many disadvantages of the gates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, they argue that some residents suffer a lot of inconvenience when they are locked out when they come home late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps this prompted the public relations officer of the Lagos state police, Partrick Erhabor, to appeal to vigilante groups who man the gates to extend the time for locking the gates. He said early closures could be counter-productive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A man who spoke on condition of anonymity also said the gates prevent law enforcement agents from answering distress calls by residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When robbers came to my house last year, my junior brother sneaked out in time to alert the police. But they could not come early enough because all the gates on the roads leading to my compound were locked,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lagos state commissioner of police, James Danbaba, shares this view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has described the erection and locking up of street gates as illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police have asked local governments to dismantle immediately the inhibiting structures, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The very existence of the gates has hampered the effective patrol of many neighborhoods where criminals hide,&quot; the police chief said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said that some dubious vigilante groups inform armed robbers about the movemment of police patrol teams. Some of the vigilantes had been arrested with armed robbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have begun discussion with relevant government organs in the state on the matter, and we have found out that no group has the power to lock up a street to inconvenience others,&quot; the police commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A local government staff, who refused to disclose his identity, said the councils &quot;should not tell the residents how best to protect themselves when it is glaring that the police alone cannot contain the menace of the robbers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Lagos state military administrator, Col. Olagunsoye Oyinlola, recently launched &quot;operation sweep&quot;, involving the deployment of about 4,000-strong joint police and military task-force. Armed robbers are in for hard times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some residents are sceptical. They prefer, instead, the relative security offered by street gates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Capital offenses in South Africa have more than doubled since the lifting of the death penalty six years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures released by the South African Police Service and the Central Statistical Service show that just under 19,000 murders were reported in South Africa last year, compared with 11,750 in 1989 when the death penalty was still in force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed robberies - including car hijacking - more than doubled from 30,500 in 1989 to almost 67,000 in 1995. Rapes and attempted rapes rose from 20,500 to almost 37,000 last year -- an increase of some 85 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the ability of the justice system to bring murderers, armed robbers and rapists before the courts has dropped from a success rate of almost 50 per cent to a mere 15 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The figures show that only 10 per cent of armed robbers are being prosecuted in South Africa, 25 per cent of all rapists and 30 per cent of murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile it was announced on Friday that South Africa is to launch a master plan to combat the country's high crime levels, which are threatening foreign confidence and investment in the South African economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new National Crime Prevention Strategy will concentrate on a new approach, switching police action from crime control to crime prevention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Ethiopians observed Tuesday the fifth anniversary of the fall of the Marxist-military regime of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day also marked the end of 30 years of civil war, the restoration of peace, as well as the advent of democracy, after centuries of feudal-monarchical donimation and 17 years of misrule by a military dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early hours of May 28, 1991, a coalition of regional guerrillas, fighting under the umbrella of the the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) took Addis Ababa, which they had besieged for several days. Mengistu's war-weary huge army was in disarray and offered little or no resistance to the rebels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A day before, the guerillas and the crumbling Mengistu government had attended a peace conference in London, under the auspices of the U.S government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the peace conference was about to start, the American mediator, former U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Herman Cohen, announced on May 27 that it had been found prudent to let EPRDF forces to enter Addis Ababa to avert bloodshed and the looting of the city by Mengistu's army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mengistu had by then fled into exile in Harare, Zimbabwe, on May 21. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan, then his deputy, as acting president. He ordered the troops to surrender their arms and let the advancing rebel forces enter the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same night, Gen. Tesfaye sought refuge in the Italian embassy in Addis Ababa, where he is still staying together with two other senior colleagues of the former regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the basis of the Lodon peace conference, the EPRDF assumed power as an interim government. A five-day national peace conclave, in which all opposition factions participated, was held in early July, leading to the creation of a transitional administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meles Zenawi served as president of the transitional government for four years. He was sworn in as executive prime minister in August 1995 after multiparty elections were held under a newly promulgated constitution devolving power to nine ethnic-based regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meles introduced a five-year program which seeks to make the country, once synonymous with cyclical drought and famine, self-sufficient in food by the year 2,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ahead of Tuesday's event, the government-owned English language daily, the Ethiopian Herald, said in its Sunday editorial that five years after the end of the civil war, the country is finaly at peace with itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Above everything else, perhaps, Ethiopia remains a single entity. None of the fragmentation, even complete disintegration, predicated by the doomsayers has come to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, the regional states work hand in hand to build a stronger and more robust Ethiopia with devotion to duty that finds strength from mutual respect,&quot; the Herald wrote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - The Academic Staff Union of Univesities (ASUU) has taken the Nigerian military government to court for banning the striking union two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union launched its strike April 9 to press for better pay and improved funding of the universities based on a 1992 agreement with the government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After stalemated negotiations, the government on May 15 banned all national unions in Nigeria's estimated 40 universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It accused the unionists of disrupting academic work and industrial harmony on the campuses. The striking teachers' pay had been frozen, while union activities were restricted to individual universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in its suit, filed by lawyer Olasupo Ojo at a Lagos high court, ASUU is contesting its dissolution, which it called &quot;illegal and unlawful,&quot; and wants the court to declare the government action null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union also wants the court to restain the national universities commission from stopping the teachers' pay or ejecting them from their official residential quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASUU is further praying the court to stop government or its agents from &quot;harassing, intimidating, arresting or detaining&quot; the lecturers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No date has been fixed for hearing of the case, which observers say could further compound the dispute and cause more disruptions to campus academic work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Nigerian education minister, Mohammed Liman, has reportedly ruled out resumption of negotiations with the striking teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told protesting teachers of the Bayero University, Kano, northern Nigeria, on Sunday to call off the strike before asking for dialogue with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liman was a lecturer at the university before he was appointed minister last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, United Nations - The United Nations recent fact-finding mission to Nigeria has said the country's transition program to democracy &quot;seems genuine&quot; and warned against any attempt to interrupt or reverse the momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a 24-page report, submitted to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the four-member mission also warned against the imposition of sanctions on the country &quot;at this stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has been under international pressure over the 1995 executions for murder of nine minority rights leaders, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. mission, which visited Nigeria at the invitation of the military government from March 29 to April 12, said imposition of sanctions could retard the progress toward positive improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission, headed by a Togolese jurist, Atsu-Koffi Amega, said there was a general opposition to any sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was pointed out that sanctions would hurt only ordinary people and have a negative impact not only on the Nigerian society but also on the whole west African region,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report said &quot;our meetings and discussions with Gen. Sani Abacha and others have given us the impression that the head of state is sincere in his commitment to restore civil democratic rule by Oct. 1 1998.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While at the moment the opponents of the regime refuse to cooperate with or participate in the election process, the mission feels that this rigid posture would soften if confidence-building measures are taken by the government, the report added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission's recommendations included strengthening the committees and commissions established to usher in democratic rule, inviting international observers to monitor the process and releasing all persons detained under Decree 2 of 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The removal of restrictions on political and professional associations, freedom of the press, and ensuring respect for judgments of the courts, are some of the other measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the trial and execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others, the mission recommended the repeal or amendment of the civil disturbance act under which the men were tried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission also recommended that the government should consider establishing a panel of eminent jurists to look into financial relief for the dependents of the deceased, as well as how to improve the socio-economic conditions of the Ogonis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission's report was sent to Gen. Sani Abacha through a U.N. special envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who visited Nigeria May 10-14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha goverment has already conveyed to the U.N. secretary-general its willingness to implement a significant part of the recommendations, and has indicated that it was considering other aspects of the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a letter to the secretary-general, Abuja said it would amend the civil disturbances act (special tribunal) to exclude members of the military from serving on it and allow for appeals against its verdict.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda - Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has said he will not appoint ministers from his country's north where he polled poorly in the May 9 election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a thanksgiving service in Luwero, 65 kilometres north of Kampala, Museveni said he will not share &quot;the political cake&quot; with areas that voted against him, but will give them &quot;some bits of the development cake&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luwero town is located within the famous &quot;Luwero Triangle&quot;, the stronghold of Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) during its five-year guerilla war against the governments of President Milton Obote and Tito Okello Lutwa, from 1981 to 1986.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When it comes to the political cake, it is another matter. Where do we get a minister from? it will mainly be according to the inputs of votes,&quot; Museveni told a huge gathering comprising of his former campaign managers and diplomats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people of northern Uganda overwhelmingly noted against Museveni in the may elections but he nevertheless won the polls with 74.2 percent overall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Now people are waiting for Kony to come from Sudan and take over government. Let them wait, that is when they will share the political cake,&quot; Museveni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance army (LRA), who are said to be operating from neighboring Sudan, campaigned for Museveni's main opponent, Paul Ssemwogerere, who defeated Museveni in most parts of northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Museveni said people who voted against him should not worry about &quot;the political cake&quot;, saying his government will reward them with &quot;the development cake&quot; by constructing roads in their areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those who did not vote for me should not worry because the president is for all people even those in prison,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is a constitutional right not to vote for Museveni but not a crime.  It is a preference though it can be wrong politically,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni will appoint his new government after the parliamentary elections due on June 27.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote d'Ivoire - One would have thought that the unprecedented reforms pushed through by the new management of the Abidjan-based African Development Bank in the last six months were enough to pacify its financiers, who seem to be bent on taking control of the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has not been the case, judjing by the decisions reached by its shareholders last week in the Ivorian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank president Omar Kabbaj told the gathering institutional and managerial reforms had cut administrative costs by 15 percent. Some 250 staff, 70 percent at the management level had been fired. Bad loans running into millions of dollars were cancelled. In short, there has been a complete overhaul of the way the bank does business, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the reward was the consent to replenish the African Development Fund (ADF), the concessional loan affiliate of the bank delayed for 30 months. But the 2.6 billion dollars donors would provide over a period of two-and-a-half years to 1998, fell far short of the 3.5 billion dollars provided for the sixth replenishment of the fund which was used up in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, the 24 non-regional members who grudgingly agreed to cough out the amount, may not do so until they secure an equal stake in the 33-year-old bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At issue is a recent report which, among other things, recommended a 50-50 percent shareholding for the 24 non-African and 53 African members of the bank. This would reverse the existing capital structure of the bank which gave regional members 66 percent and 34 percent for non-regional members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Key African members opposed the deal, and only the timely intervention of Gabonese President Omar Bongo averted an imminent stand-off between the two sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bongo has convened a &quot;special summit&quot; of African leaders for June 7, in Libreville, to thrash out the issue of governance, as well as problems arising from huge arraes owed to the bank by some 25 African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts say the Libreville meeting is historically significant in the sense that it was in the Gabonese capital that talks about opening the capital of the bank to foreigners commenced 18 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ADB was established in 1963, and was wholly African until 1982 when it began to admit non-regional members, who took up one-third of its shares thus boosting increasing the capital base, which now stands at some 24 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its statutory goals include providing loans and equity investment for the economic and social development of African countries. The bank uses its call-up capital to support loans from international finance markets for on-lending the members countries at prevailing market rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank group includes the ADF set up 1972, with subscribed shares estimated at 11.5 billion dollars at the end of 1995. It is owned by the ADB and 24 countries from the America's, Asia, Europe and the Middle-East. The Fund provides interest-free loans to poorer African countries which number 39 at percent. It is supposed to be replenished after every three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third affiliate is the Nigerian Trust Fund (NTF), set up by Nigeria in 1976, to assist the development efforts of less endowed regional members.  The NTF resources were 440 million dollars at the end of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ADB group was a net creditor to African countries in the 1980s, providing credit lines averaging 3 billion dollars per annum in its heydays, a fact which helped win her three tripple 'a' ratings in 1984, which it still maintains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the Bank has suffered considerable decline this decade, comparable only to the economic difficulties facing most of its regional members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its loan portfolio has plummeted by more than half. Debts were mounting as fast as its coffers went drying up, prompting drastic reforms, and the ongoing move to change its capital structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the arguments proponents of the 50-50 capital structure advance is that it would give the bank a wider financial base needed to make it competitive in the increasingly liberalised and market-oriented global financial market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But critics say this is far from the point, suggesting that donors simply want to grab the bank and use it to serve their interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian finance minister, Anthony Ani, reiterated a long-standing position of his country to maintain the African character of the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Personally I believe that 33 percent shares held by the non-regionals in the Bank should be enough for them.. Afterall, they contol the African Development Fund already,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, the proposal on governance carry fundamental political implications which border on the very raison d'etre of the bank, Ani said. He suggested that the move be deferred pending full consultations of all members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If funding is the problem, he said, Nigeria was willing to acquire the shares of poor African countries and wharehouse it for them until a time they were ready to pay and reclaim them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporting this view, Kenya's deputy finance minister, Keah Benedict, questioned the excessive bias against Africans in the report, saying it consistently proposed reduction in the number of regional directors only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are also pained to note that in several sections, the report has anti-African and even insulting references, which are in my view without any foundation and which should be objected to strongly,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, other regional delegates say president Kabbaj, who supports the proposal to change the ownership structure of the bank, is receiving so much unqualified support from the non-regional delegates that they have begun to suspect there is a hidden agenda somewhere along the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rate of cooperation and praise singing is very suspicious and may not bode well for the ADB as an African development institution,&quot; a delegate who does not want to be identified said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, if Africans lose ownership of the Bank through equities and restructuring, they also lose control of the objectives and destiny of the Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is at stake is the huge amount of money annually expended by the Bank for the acquisition of machinery and equipment and projects consultancy running into millions of U.S. dollars&quot; one African finance analyst told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, others wonder why the ADB structure should be different from other multilateral development banks such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even so, analysts say these arguments sound as logical as they appear outlandish in relation to the predicament facing the ADB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The African Development Bank can only remain African if Africans are ready to fund it,&quot; they added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts said the index movement was curtailed in the week in review because of the adjustment for dividend and bonus issue by big quoted companies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerians are divided over the report of the recent United Nations fact-finding mission, which gave qualified support to the military government's transition programme to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition members have rejected the report, while pro-government groups say they are satisfied. For a third group, &quot;caution&quot; is the word.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 24-page report of the four-member U.N. team, released at the weekend in New York, said the 36-month political transition programme by Gen. Sani Abacha seemed genuine and should not be disrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also opposed the call for sanctions against Nigeria, saying this could be counter-productive. However, it urged the military administration to release all political detainees and improve its human rights record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abacha government has responded with the announcement of some political and judicial reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Committee for Defence of Human Rights in Nigeria described the U.N. report as &quot;heart-rendering and sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said that it was &quot;incredible&quot; that the mission made such recommendations &quot;when there was clear evidence that the military regime had intensified violations of rights in an unprecedented manner, not withstanding global condemnations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wife of detained millionaire-politician Moshood Abiola, Kudirat, also rejected the finding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her view is shared by another opposition politician, Remi Okunrinboye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any programme without M.K.O. Abiola's release will be jaundiced,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola, the undeclared winner of the 1993 presidential election annulled by the last military regime, is facing trial for treasonable felony after declaring himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Adekunle Ajasin, a former civilian governor and now a key official of the opposition democratic coalition called NADECO, was cautious in his reaction. He said he needed &quot;more time for wider consutlation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another politician, Doyin Okupe, said it was within the prerogative of the U.N. to &quot;endorse whatever it liked.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abel Ubeku, the spokesman of the Political Group Committee for National Consensus, expressed happiness at the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It showed that the U.N. knows that Nigerians are capable of sorting out their problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has been embroiled in political crisis over the 1993 annulled presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International pressure on the country heightened following the November 1995 executions for murder of nine Nigerian minority rights leaders, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was to douse the tension that Nigerian invited the U.N. to a fact-finding mission in Nigeria. The team's visit lasted from March 29 to April 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission addressed the trial that led to the executions and also assessed Abacha's political transition programme, which critics consider too long.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia - President Frederick Chiluba signed the constitutional amendment bill Tuesday to effect Zambia's new constitution that will bar citizens whose parents were born outside the country from becoming president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution also officially recognises Zambia as &quot;a Christian nation tolerant of other religions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba put his signature to the bill at a ceremony at state house witnessed by hundreds of party officials of his ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy. The ceremony was covered live by the national radio and television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excited supporters of the new law honked their car horns, blew whistles and beat drums as Chiluba signed the bill at 1100 gmt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution prevents former President Kenneth Kaunda, who is of Malawian parents, from challenging Chiluba in this year's scheduled presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba said that his agreement to sign the bill did not mean Zambia would be intolerant of other religions. He said that the law was not specifically aimed at the former head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He appealed to Zambians to cooperate with law and security enforcement agents to thwart possible violent reaction by some political parties and other groups opposed to the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clandestine group, calling itself the Black Mamba, and variously linked to local opposition parties and Islamic militants, has threatened to harm Chiluba and his members of parliament for passing the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD-dominated parliament enacted the constitution last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Central Committee of the main opposition United National Independence Party of Kaunda were reported Tuesday to be arranging for an emergency meeting to plan a new program of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources at the party's headquarters in the capital, Freedom House, told PANA that the meeting would be chaired by Kaunda. The former president is expected to arrive in the capital Tuesday from a three-week visit to Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties have vowed to challenge and breach the new law. The Zambia Democratic Congress, earlier Tuesday, lost an application to the Supreme Court to bar Chiluba from signing the law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said Thursday that member states should rededicate themselves to the ideals of Pan-Africanism and unity in ending the continent's conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the time to remind ourselves of our collective and individual commitments to the organization,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His appeal came on the eve of the 33rd anniversary of the signing of the organisations charter. The occasion, known as Africa Day, is celebrated each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His message spoke of Africa's &quot;unfinished business&quot; of unity. That ideal is for African states to gradually work toward a single continental government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim said that during this year's observance of Africa Day, Africans must reflect on their achievements, and not just on war and political instability in Burundi, Liberia and Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans, he said, were making efforts to promote economic integration, consolidate democracy and end conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described fighting in Liberia as the latest &quot;vicious and senseless war&quot; in West Africa. But it had &quot;elicited a collective and honourable response from the states in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said an immediate cease-fire was needed in Monrovia and for all armed elements to leave the city. That way, Monrovia would regain its status as a &quot;safe haven.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He appealed to Burundi's leaders to negotiate with rebels and save the country from growing degeneration. The international community, he said, had limited patience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the country's leaders should accept the peace proposal laid out by Tanzania's first president, Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal - The foundation stone and monument of the future African university will be laid Friday at Sebikotane, 35 kilometers south-east of Dakar, the Senegalese capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed bilingual (English and French) institution is to be erected on the location of the former William Ponty School, which produced eminent West African scholars, including the late Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foundation stone laying ceremony will be among the highlights of an international conference of African intellectuals and scholars which entered its third day in Dakar Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The intellectuals are trying to shape Africa's position in the 21st century on various crucial aspects, including integration, so as to be competitive in the emerging global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked to explain the mechanisms of setting up the the African university, Mamadou Diouf, a history professor at Dakar's Cheikh Anta Diop university, said initially sections of Senegalese academic institutions would be reshaped and upgraded to play a regional role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The university, which will have branches in several parts of Africa, would admit the best working graduate students from all over Africa, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The students would be given top-notch training as a way of building and maintaining their capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diouf said the teaching body of the proposed institution would be constituted by non-permanent staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Instead, high-calibre lecturers would be engaged on short contracts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed institution would be structured along the lines of the University of West Indies, which has campuses in Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago. It would be funded by states and institutions which send students on a cost-sharing basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will enable African governments and institutions to cut costs instead of having to send their students for higher training abroad,&quot; said Diouf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether the university would not face funding problems like a host of many other African institutions, Diouf said: &quot;We need to have funds for at least 20 years before launching it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said before the institution takes off, there must be a foundation catering for the pure and social sciences, to avoid falling into what he termed as the &quot;donors syndrome.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Africans are capable of raising the required funds &quot;provided the institution is removed from partisan politics and that's why there must be no permanent staff.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Diouf could not state exactly when the university would take off.&quot;We really need to make proper planning to avoid false starts,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria - As tributes pour in from across the world, Nigeria's military government has declared a three-day national mourning beginning Thursday for the country's late and first president, Nnamdi Azikiwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military ruler, Gen Sani Abacha, told a delegation of Azikwe's family Wednesday that Nigeria's flag would also fly at half-mast for seven days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described the May 11 death of Azikwe, 91, as &quot;a great loss&quot; not only to Nigeria but the whole of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The passing of the &quot;Great Zik of Africa&quot;, as he is fondly known, was formally announced Tuesday by his family in accordance with the tradition of his kinsmen from eastern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An icon of Nigeria's independence, Azikiwe was governor-general of the country from 1960 to 1963 and president from 1963 until the first military coup in 1966.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Azikiwe the statesman, nationalist, orator and sportsman is remembered as much for his political achievements as his journalistic skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tributes have come from both his admirers and critics, who chided him for his philosophy of political compromise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emeka Ojukwu, who fell out with the statesman when the former led the eastern Nigeria's Igbo rebellion, kwown as the Biafra War of 1967-70, was philosophical in his tribute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many have loved, many do love and many shall love Zik, but only a few can understand him,&quot; Ojukwu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Olubunmi Okogie, said &quot;a great star has fallen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described Azikiwe as &quot;a man of many parts who made sure that his influence was greatly felt in different positions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tributes from outside the country included those of the Commonwealth secretary-general, Emeka Anyaoku, and Azikewe's alma mata, Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Cote d'Ivoire - Nigeria and Libya, two big stakers in the African Development Bank (ADB), have opposed the proposal to increase the shareholding of the bank's 24 non-regional members to 50 percent, thus bringing it at par with those of its 53 African members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I personally believe that the 33 percent shares held by the non-regionals in the bank should be enough for them... afterall, they control the African Development Bank already&quot;, Nigeria's finance minister, Anthony Anim, told the annual general meeting of the bank which entered its second day in the Ivorian economic capital on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy governor of Libya's central bank, Breni Egeli, supported the Nigerian position saying any increase in non-regional shares in the bank &quot;will not be okay for Africa&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria holds the highest share of 10.1 percent share in the bank in addition to establishing a soft loan window called the Nigeria Trust Fund now worth 440 million dollars. Libya falls just above the middle range of share holders with a 3.8 percent, behind such other big stakers as Egypt and Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, the 53 African members own 66 percent of the share capital of the bank as against some 34 percent for the 24 non-regionals from the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Caribbean and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report on the governance of the bank being discussed at the ongoing general assembly suggested a number of options, key among them being that non-African members acquire the same amount of shares as the regionals, as well as have the same level of control over major bank decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most African delegates oppose the proposal but would not speak up in categorical terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we are concerned about is to increase the capital as soon as possible for the benefit of the members of the bank,&quot; said Egypt's governor, Hassan Ismael Mohammed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that while it would be preferable to maintain the African identity of the bank, the challenge for now is to do so with support from the non-regionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Switzerland, a non-regional member, also agrees that the &quot;outsiders&quot; had already increased their leverage in the bank and that further equity control was not necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its governor, Nicholas Imboden, said a change in the character was a higher political issue that could only be handled by African leaders at the highest political level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This issue has for years raised the question as to who really owns the bank, set up by African governments in 1963 to foster the social and economic development of individual countries and that of the continent as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-regional members, which were 25 until Yugoslavia disintegrated, joined the bank in July 1982 to help boost the bank's capital base and resource mobilisation. Thus, acquisition of one-third of the bank's shares in essence changed its profile to that of an international development bank though it still maintains its original name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, the non-regionals effectively control its soft loan window, the African Development Fund, from which some 39 African members source investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW YORK, - The United Nations has said some 80 percent of vehicles belonging to its Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) were looted at the height of the fighting which erupted in Monrovia April 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report to the security council the U.N. secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said the Liberian fighters also made away with telephones, computers, photocopiers, communications equipment and general consumables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general said Wednesday that UNOMIL was currently estimating the value of the looted goods and equipment, and that it would take at least three months to rebuild the mission's logistic base.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;UNOMIL and all U.N. agencies have been systematically looted by fighters from all factions since April 6,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;the fighters cleaned out all U.N. offices, damaged the buildings and looted U.N.  warehouses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNOMIL was deployed to liberia in 1995 to assist the sub-regional peace monitoring force (ECOMOG), in the implementation of the Abuja peace accord, signed by the warring factions in the Nigerian capital last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only five of the mission's 93 military observers have remained in the country after the others were evacuated to Freetown and Dakar during the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite the looting and threat to the lives of the U.N. observers, the secretary-general has recommended that the mission's mandate be extended for three months, until August 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In making the recommendation, to the security council, he said though there was little that UNOMIL could do under the unstable situation in Liberia, it could still use its good offices to facilitate efforts to restore the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the renewed fighting, the secretary-general accused the faction leaders of disregarding the will of their people for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Over the past six weeks, the faction leaders have clearly demonstrated their disregard for the aspirations of the Liberian people for peace,&quot; he said. &quot;They have shown wanton disrespect for the U.N., ECOWAS and the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned the faction leaders that if, through their actions, they forced ECOMOG to withdraw from Liberia, the U.N. would also end its mission in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BRAZZAVILLE, Congo - Congolese President Pascal Lissouba has called on France to use its influence in bringing to an end the current crisis in the Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a radio broadcast Wednesday, Lissouba expressed his &quot;deep concern&quot; at the current situation in the Bangui, the Central African Republic capital, where parts of the army started a mutiny Saturday and are demanding the resignation of the democratically elected president, Ange-Felix Patasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation was tense Thursday morning in Bangui, where troops from the French Legion intervened on Wednesday afternoon against the mutineers near the national radio station and are reported to have taken control of other strategic installations in the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lissouba said, before the French intervention to support loyalists whose lines were being broken by the mutineers, that there was in Bangui an &quot;escalation which involved high risks for the Central African people and for the democratic process under way in their country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This situation &quot;is a cause for concern for the (country's) friends, among whom is Congo, a neighboring and sister nation&quot;, he said, noting that the use of arms to settle social and political conflicts was not &quot;a good option for democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lissouba still remembers the ethnic clashes which killed more than 2,000 people in the southern areas of Brazzaville in 1993, among supporters of the opposition and government alike, and the mutiny of young conscripts last February in the same town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Considering the turn of events, we should strive to preserve democracy in the Central African Republic and fight against all attempts at taking power through illegal...or armed insurrection&quot;, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conclusion, he asked France to use all means to get the Central African Republic out of the crisis and called on the international community to support France's action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a radio address broadcast the same day in Bangui, President Patasse stressed the need to continue negotiations with mutineers, while rejecting some of their demands, especially that of his resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He agreed to other demands, espcially extending to the mutineers the amnesty granted to soldiers who had mutinied in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patasse said a putsch would not solve the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French commando troops for Special Operations arrived Wednesday morning at Bangui airport which is now under their control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The committee in the U.S. House of Representatives with principal responsibility for foreign aid has approved legislation eliminating all earmarking of funds for sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed bill also cuts $1 billion from the foreign aid budget proposed by President Clinton for fiscal year 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a brief meeting on May 29, the House Appropriations Committee voted to eliminate funding for the Development Fund for Africa, a legislative vehicle established in 1987 to designate money for development projects in Africa. Funding for Africa projects will be drawn from the $1.96 billion the committee allocated for development assistance. The committee approved specific earmarks of nearly $5 billion in funds for Israel and Egypt and close to $1 billion for Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee-approved bill also terminates funding for the Africa Development Bank and makes deep cuts in the U.S. contribution to the World Bank. The U.S. contribution to the International Development Association, a World Bank affiliate which provides substantial assistance to Africa, was reduced by almost 44 percent from the level requested by the Clinton administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foreign aid funding bill, known as the &quot;Foreign Operations Appropriation,&quot; will come to a vote in the full House of Representatives on June 5, according to committee sources. The legislation still must be approved by the Senate before it is sent to President Clinton for signing into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton administration had proposed $12.8 billion in aid for the next fiscal year, but the Appropriations Committee action cut total funding to $11.9 billion. The reduction for the International Development Association (IDA) from the administration's request of $935 million to $525 million accounted for almost half the total cuts. Because of severe slashes last year, the Clinton administration's IDA request this year was primarily designated to meet past obligations to the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IDA provides loans to the world's poorest countries at below-market interest rates and, according to U.S. Treasury Department officials, is the world's largest lender to projects which contribute to child survival. &quot;For the three billion people living in the world's poorest countries, IDA is the single most important provider of concessional development assistance,&quot; Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other actions taken yesterday the committee also eliminated all funds for the African Development Bank, although last year when this happened the funding was restored in a House-Senate conference committee. The committee increased funding for UNICEF above President Clinton's requested level, boosted funds for international counter-narcotics efforts and voted $600 million for programs effecting children in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Updates on the committee's action is available from the House Appropriations Committee's web site at &lt;http://www.house.gov/appropriations/welcome.html&gt;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is a State Department statement issued on May 31 deploring Zambia's decision to impose constitutional amendments &quot;that limit the right of the Zambian people to choose their president freely&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States deeply deplores the decision this week of the Government of Zambia to impose constitutional amendments, on the eve of the first national elections in Zambia's democratic era, that limit the right of the Zambian people to choose their president freely. These amendments seriously threaten the integrity and credibility of the electoral process and significantly undermine Zambia's democratic development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In light of the Government of Zambia's action, the United States is reviewing its bilateral and multilateral relationship, including assistance programs in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The warm relations between the United States and Zambia, and our partnership in Zambia's development, have been based on our shared commitment to democracy and economic reform. We have repeatedly made known to the Government of Zambia our deep concerns over these amendments and other recent actions that threaten to undermine Zambia's new democratic system. The United States urges the Government of Zambia to reverse its decision on the constitutional amendments, to renew its commitment to democracy, and to take immediate steps to ensure that this year's elections are free and fair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - The UN Security Council voted to accept the recommendation of Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) until 31 August 1996. Unanimously adopting resolution 1059 (1996), the Council expressed concern at the collapse of the cease-fire, the resumption of hostilities and the spread of fighting into the previously safe area of Monrovia and its environs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council demanded that the factions in Liberia strictly respect the status of UNOMIL and the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) personnel and called upon the Liberian parties to implement all arrangements and commitments they have already entered into, in particular the Abuja Agreement. Following is the text of the resolution:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing that the escalating violence is in violation of the Abuja Agreement (S/1995/742, annex) and puts the peace process at grave risk,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firmly convinced of the importance of Monrovia as a safe haven, and noting especially the recent broader deployment of ECOMOG in the city, Emphasizing once again that the people of Liberia and their leaders bear the ultimate responsibility for achieving peace and national reconciliation,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expressing its appreciation to those African States that have contributed and are contributing troops to the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commending also those Member States that have supported the peace process and ECOMOG, including through contributions to the Trust Fund for Liberia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing also that the presence of UNOMIL in Liberia is predicated on the presence of ECOMOG and its commitment to ensure the safety of UNOMIL military observers and civilian staff,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - The Security Council this afternoon decided to reduce the military component of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) by 20 per cent -- from 288 to 230 personnel -- while extending the Mission's mandate until 30 November. This action was taken on the understanding that it would not impair effective monitoring of the cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through its unanimous adoption of resolution 1056 (1996), the Council suspended temporarily the identification process, which aims at identifying those eligible to participate in the planned referendum. The suspension would remain in effect until both the Government of Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) had demonstrated their commitment to resuming and completing the process without further obstacles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the resolution, today's temporary suspension of the work of the Identification Commission did not imply any lessening of the Council's resolve to secure implementation of the settlement plan. Under that plan, the parties agree to the holding of a referendum to enable the people of Western Sahara to choose between independence and integration with Morocco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council urged the two parties to demonstrate the political will, cooperation and flexibility to permit resumption and early completion of the identification process. It also called on them to cooperate with the United Nation on such aspects of the settlement plan as the release of Saharan political prisoners and the exchange of prisoners of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While reminding the parties that it would have to consider other measures if significant progress was not made during the upcoming mandate period, the Council stressed its readiness to support resumption of the identification process as soon as the parties made that possible. It supported the Secretary-General's proposal to maintain a political office to continue dialogue with the parties and the two neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting, which was called to order at 12:54 p.m., was adjourned at 12:58 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Resolution Adopted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The text of the resolution adopted by the Council reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Security Council,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Reaffirming all its previous resolutions on the question of Western Sahara,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Having considered the report of the Secretary-General of 8 May 1996 (S/1996/343),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Noting the views expressed by the Government of Morocco as set out in the report of the Secretary-General and in the memorandum attached to the letter addressed to the Secretary-General dated 10 May 1996 (S/1996/345),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Noting also the views expressed by the Polisario Front as set out in the report of the Secretary-General and in the memorandum attached to the letter addressed to the Secretary-General dated 23 May 1996 (S/1996/366),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Noting also the letter dated 23 May 1996 from the Current Chairman and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (S/1996/376),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Reaffirming its commitment to assist the parties to achieve a just and lasting solution to the question of Western Sahara,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Stressing the importance it attaches to the maintenance of the cease- fire, as an integral part of the settlement plan,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Recognizing that, despite all the difficulties, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has to date identified more than 60,000 persons,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Reiterating that, for progress to be achieved, the two parties must have a vision of the post-referendum period,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;1. Reiterates its commitment to the holding, as soon as possible, of a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara in accordance with the settlement plan which has been accepted by the two parties referred to above;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;2. Deeply regrets the fact that the required willingness does not exist to give MINURSO the cooperation needed for it to resume and complete the identification process, and that there has therefore been no significant progress towards implementation of the settlement plan;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;3. Agrees with the recommendation of the Secretary-General that the identification process be suspended until such time as both parties provide concrete and convincing evidence that they are committed to resuming and completing it without further obstacles, in accordance with the settlement plan;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;4. Supports the proposal of the Secretary-General to reduce the strength of the military component of MINURSO by 20 per cent, on the understanding that this will not impair its operational effectiveness in monitoring the cease-fire;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;5. Endorses the view of the Secretary-General that the decision to suspend temporarily the work of the Identification Commission and to reduce the number of civilian police and military personnel does not imply any lessening of resolve to secure the implementation of the settlement plan;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;6. Supports the proposal of the Secretary-General, in the context of the settlement plan, to maintain a political office to continue the dialogue with the parties and the two neighbouring countries and to facilitate any other effort that could help set the parties on the course towards an agreed formula for the resolution of their differences and encourages the Secretary- General to consider ways of strengthening the role of this office;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;7. Urges the two parties to demonstrate without further delay the political will, cooperation and flexibility necessary to permit the resumption and early completion of the identification process and the implementation of the settlement plan; notes with satisfaction that the parties have respected the cease-fire, which is an integral part of the settlement plan, and calls upon them to continue to do so;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;8. Also calls upon the parties, as a demonstration of good will, to cooperate with the United Nations in the implementation of certain aspects of the settlement plan, such as the release of Saharan political prisoners and the exchange of prisoners of war on humanitarian grounds, as soon as possible, to accelerate implementation of the settlement plan in its entirety;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;9. Encourages the parties to consider additional ways to create confidence between themselves in order to remove obstacles to implementation of the settlement plan;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;10. Decides to extend the mandate of MINURSO, on the basis proposed by the Secretary-General in his report of 8 May 1996, until 30 November 1996;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;11. Reminds the parties that if significant progress is not achieved during this period, the Council will have to consider other measures, including possible further reductions in the strength of MINURSO, but stresses its readiness to support the resumption of the identification process as soon as the parties have demonstrated the necessary political will, cooperation and flexibility, as called for in paragraph 7 above;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;12. Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts with the parties to break the impasse blocking the implementation of the settlement plan, and to submit a report to the Council by 31 August 1996 on the outcome of his efforts;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;13. Also requests the Secretary-General to keep the Council closely informed of all significant developments, including their humanitarian aspects, and to submit a comprehensive report on the implementation of this resolution by 10 November 1996;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;14. Decides to remain seized of the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When the South African national soccer squad assembled for their World Cup debut in Nigeria four years ago, they drove straight to Jan Smuts Airport and flew north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not a single training session was held at home and the inevitable humiliation followed as the Clemens Westerhof-coached Super Eagles cruised to a 4-0 victory and eventual qualification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa launch their second attempt to reach the showpiece of international football on Saturday afternoon at the 50 000-capacity Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And while Malawi cannot be compared with Nigeria, there are other reasons to suggest that millions of Bafana Bafana supporters will not witness another heavy defeat this time round.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For starters, South African coach Clive Barker has had his squad together since Monday, training daily at Marks Park in late autumn weather conditions ideal for footballers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The squad are based at a hotel near the city centre which oozes warmth and friendliness and whose food would satisfy even the most discerning palate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These factors should ensure that a happy, healthy and fit squad represents the rainbow nation, and the word from Barker that all financial arrangements have been tied up is reassuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The build-up to the friendly match against Brazil last month was marred by reports of threatened strikes over bonuses, and however untrue they were, damage was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another significant difference between Lagos and Blantyre is that South Africa circa 1992 were a group of naive, inexperienced players trying to come to grips with international football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe delivered the first blow to the myth that South Africa would conquer Africa in weeks rather than months, and then came Nigeria, Zambia and Mexico to inflict further punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coach &quot;Screamer&quot; Tshabalala resigned soon after the Nigeria debacle and Peruvian-born replacement Augusto Palacios instilled an element of discipline and organisation into the national set-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Palacios left following the heavy loss to Mexico, opening the door to Barker, a First Division footballer of no great note who had developed into a highly successful coach with several First Division clubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slowly but surely a powerful team was assembled without any remarkable change in personnel. Of the team beaten in Nigeria, Mark Anderson, Sizwe Motaung, Lucas Radebe, Tovey and Philemon Masinga are going to Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowning glory came on February 3 1996 when Mark Williams came on as a second-half substitute and scored twice within three minutes to give Bafana Bafana victory over Tunisia in the Nations' Cup decider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when his charges were leading world champions Brazil 2-0 at halftime in the Nelson Mandela Inauguration Challenge last month, Barker must have wondered if heaven really could be any better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South Americans demonstrated why they have won the world title more times than any other nation with a stirring second-half comeback which brought three goals and victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if the loss to Egypt brought the Barker boys down to earth at a crucial stage of the Nations' Cup, who can say that there were not significant benefits from losing to the Brazilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Victory over the Samba sorcerers would surely have left many heads so high in the clouds that even Barker might have battled to drag them down to earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long-suspected defensive frailties were exposed as tiring South Africans were dragged out of position and found wanting in the speed department. Hopefully, the lessons have been learnt with the form of Motaung, who has often appeared jaded this season, showing timely improvement in a weekend Coca-Cola Challenge Cup fixture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goalkeeper Andre Arendse seems certain to be chosen again and if Barker opts for four at the back, Motaung, Tovey, Mark Fish and Radebe are going to be the choices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been hints that a fifth defender may be added in which case Tovey would become a sweeper, Radebe would move into the middle and David Nyathi come in at leftback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no reason to change the well-balanced Nations' Cup-winning midfield quartet of Innocent Buthelezi and Eric Tinkler (steel) and Doctor Khumalo and &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu (skill).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In attack, the absence through injury of Williams means it looks like Philemon Masinga and Shaun Bartlett if Barker chooses four defenders, or Masinga if five defenders are selected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi have been playing in the World Cup since 1976 without making an impression and will rely heavily on South African-based midfielders Chancey Gondwe and Ernest Chirwali to cause an upset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In warm-up matches, the Malawians defeated Mozambique 1-0 last Sunday through a goal from captain Wilfred Nyalugwe, and lost 1-0 and drew 1-1 with Zambia the previous weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malawi certainly rank among the tougher preliminary-round opponents South Africa could have drawn, which may not be a bad thing as it will eliminate any danger of complacency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While victory is obviously what Barker desires, he would probably be satisfied with a draw (preferably with lots of goals) ahead of the return match at FNB Stadium on June 15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - &quot;My songs are like my kids,&quot; says Angelique Kidjo, gravel-voiced on the line from Paris, &quot;so don't ask me to choose between them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kidjo's keeping an open phone line to South Africa to mark the launch here this week of her fourth album, Fifa. Like many singers, she saves the full power of her voice for the stage, chatting softly and breaking off now and then to respond to some query from a relative passing through her room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while she's unwilling to pick any favourite music, she does have a favourite memory: cutting the track Wombo Lombo with South Africans Jabu Khanyile and Busi Mhlongo. &quot;That was a very cool experience. Busi Mhlongohas a magnificent voice; she's so professional to work with.&quot; Shrewdly, Wombo Lombo with its distinctively South African beat is scheduled as the first single release here from her album.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The singer's first name in her native Fon is &quot;very philosophical and mystical. It translates as: 'You can't substitute blood for paraffin to light the lamp' -- which means you can't walk on people if you want to have success.&quot; And Kidjo's own story, as she tells it, is much more that of the hard-working trouper paying her showbiz dues at every stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her mother ran a touring theatrical company; her brother -- like every other aspiring young guitarist in the 1970s -- was filling the family home with the recorded sounds of Santana and Earth, Wind and Fire. And Benin was a musical crossroads for the sounds of West, Central and North Africa: makossa, rhumba, Arabic pop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these were sources of inspiration for the determinedly eclectic young singer. Local concerts and radio shows in Benin were followed by the inevitable pilgrimage to Paris in 1983, where she enrolled for training as a jazz singer and gigged around a hectic Afro music scene. A stint with one of Europe's favourite Afro-jazz groups, Pili-Pili, was crowned by an appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1987. Marriage to co-composer and bassist Jean Hebrail and her first album, Parakou, followed not long after.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Kidjo has had her first child, and that imagery dominates the interview. Her songs are her &quot;kids&quot;; the development of her style across the four albums is &quot;like a child growing up&quot;; the process of composition is &quot;like giving birth -- some songs give you a hard time, a lot of pain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her talent for composition is one of the things which distinguishes Kidjo from the current crop of Afropop chanteuses. Her music has grown up as she has: last year's tough little disco queen of the Aye album, with its hit track Agolo, has been remade on Fifa. Here she is cynical political commentator (on the track Akwaba, about the &quot;catastrophe&quot; of CFA franc devaluation), ethno musicologist (on Welcome, with its opening a cappella chorus taken from Kidjo's field recording of Manigri Muslim women) and gentle mother crooning a lullaby (on the title track).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Irrespective of tempo, &quot;I always write based on percussion, on how the theme would sound on percussion instruments. Then Jean has ideas to put chords, orchestrations, over that. So it starts with rhythm. And for the words, well, sometimes everybody in the house has to shut up until I get them right-- until they say exactly my own truth. The vital thing is not to lie in your songs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kidjo's voice, with its capacity to swoop from carrying a true, bell-like vocal line to field-holler, gurgle and growl, isn't unlike that of Brenda Fassie. The difference is that the music industry here never let Brenda grow up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's perhaps significant that the Beninoise Kidjo can draw on ancient traditions to create more mature material. Fifa features three tracks in tribute to vodun (voodoo), which she describes as her &quot;first religion&quot; and which former Benin president Nicefor Soglo declared an official faith on January 10 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on Kidjo's skillfully negotiated rise to the top of the Afropop music business, Cameroonian journalist Thomas Ayeh says:&quot; References to vodun have wide appeal -- at home, in Brazil, Haiti, Cuba,and they add that touch of exoticism for European music fans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Yet beyond that, in francophone Africa, we always see that people rooted in their own traditions handle the complexities and contradictions of Western institutions much more confidently than those whom the French have completely assimilated in culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kidjo's reluctant to talk too much about vodun, and says: &quot;I haven't yet used vodun rhythms even on these songs. I've just used the gods and the ceremonies as themes for lyrics. I don't know enough -- I'm not ready yet --to handle those rhythms with enough respect. That may come later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And what of the slickly shorn crewcut which publicists crow over as the epitome of the &quot;post-modern African woman&quot;, and cultural nationalists ascribe to reverence for those ancient women warriors, the amazons of Dahomey? Kidjo herself is a lot more prosaic: &quot;In Africa, when you have braids, all your friends jump on your hair to help; it's a social occasion, it's fun. I cut my hair in 1985, simply because I got fed up with having to have my hair made up every two weeks in France in a salon -- which is a nightmare, and, incidentally, costs you a fortune too. My hairdresser came up with this style. It's easy and it's me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Behind the bonhomie and words of solidarity at last week's World Economic Forum/Southern African Development Community economic summit in Cape Town lurked real tension that South Africa can ill-afford to ignore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These mainly centred around South Africa's dominance of regional trade and the need to review its trade relations with its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwean delegation of business people and government officials was particularly vociferous, with President Robert Mugabe hinting strongly of retaliatory action to protect Zimbabwean industries against South African imports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After intense discussions, South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin agreed to send a negotiating team to Harare on June 10 to review the long-stalled trade negotiations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe's preferential trade agreement with South Africa lapsed in 1992 and repeated efforts to renegotiate the pact have failed, with South Africa pushing for a multilateral trade agreement among Southern African Developing Countries states rather than individual agreements. This is tied in with efforts to renegotiate the Southern African Customs Union between South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A massive inflow of South African goods into Zimbabwe in the past few years has threatened the viability of many industries there, with clothing and textiles worst affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been very patient, but we think we have been short-changed by South Africa in terms of our business arrangement,&quot; said Zimbabwe's National Planning Minister Richard Hove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a media briefing, Botswana's President Ketumile Masire said he was also concerned about his country's trade imbalance with South Africa, but believed negotiations rather than retaliatory measures were needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the renegotiation of the South African Customs Union, which is seen to have an unfair bias in favour of South Africa, Masire said: &quot;It seems that the South Africans are much more prepared to democratise the whole thing rather than having it as one-sided as it was before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are problems in that the South African economy is a much bigger economy than any of the others but where there is a will there is a way,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the sometimes huge imbalances in regional industrial development and trade flows, it may well be that more than &quot;will&quot; is called for and Erwin will no doubt be kept on his toes finding a meaningful solution to the problem. His counterparts in neighbouring states are expected to keep up the pressure for some kind of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Among corporate South Africa's more dramatic -- and all too rare -- success stories is the Internet Solution (IS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two years ago David Frankel and Alon Apteker financed the company, then a fledgling enterprise started by three computer science graduates, to the tune of R300 000. In February, the Sankorp-affiliated Dimension Data paid R12,5-million for a 25% stake in IS, thus putting the total value of IS at R50- million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IS started off taking corporate networks and connecting them to the Internet. It soon became obvious that security was a major barrier to using the Internet, hence the company's specialisation in network security.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secure in the commercial market and with a solid base, IS branched into the dial-up market. Now, the greatest potential growth is in applications.  Today, IS is structured into four distinct entities:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IS connects corporate networks to the Internet via digital leased line connections. Trusted Network Solution (TNS) provides network security.  Started in August 1995, it is 90%- owned by IS and 10% by the directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In October, IS and Persetel's Software Connection, South Africa's largest software retailer, formed a jointly controlled company Internet Connection (Icon) to provide Internet access to dial-up users. Icon is a natural extension of IS's commercial Internet access services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internet Solution-Commercial (IS-Commercial), the latest subsidiary, opened in January to provide Web site development, system integration and software engineering. It is 90%-owned by IS and 10% by directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 12% of turnover, or R300 000 a month, is contributed to IS by each of the subsidiaries -- TNS, Icon and IS-Commercial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IS has a turnover of R2,5-million a month, handles a message every five seconds on average, employs 75 people (75% have technical degrees) with an average age of 26, and services 70% to 75% of all businesses in South Africa with digital leased line Internet connections. More than 225 companies are on board and the list is growing at a rate of 15 to 20 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its 50%-owned Internet Connection opened in November and already has 12,5% of South Africa's dial-up market, growing by 60 users a day that will reach 100 by July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Focused on providing turnkey solutions around the spreading Internet revolution, IS is well- positioned to sustain such rapid growth. With some R2-million in the bank and the Dimension Data relationship, IS has financial muscle for future expansion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is moving beyond a supplier/vendor relationship to looking for opportunities to partner companies that understand technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is potential to form business partnerships with major clients where IS provides the expertise in information technology and the clients provide the product and market. The biggest potential is in the financial sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many feel that enabling organisations to take full advantage of the new markets and global opportunities for information interchange offered by the Internet has barely begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the moment, IS's value chain is installation of leased lines, routers, service mail configurations, firewalls, access controls, software, web sites with interactive applications and training for staff and users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The possibilities for publishing, entertainment, banking and other industries whose product is information-based are huge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consumers, though, are not impressed. People are flocking to see what the broad Internet is all about. Most are excited. Many though, are ultimately disappointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the potential is there. As more and more people start to use the Internet, it will grow in popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Internet also has significant implications for internal corporate communication, the so- called intranet, which is widely used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far IS is an inspiration, demonstrating that companies can still thrive in the South African economy and that opportunities exist. If only there were more examples.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - To the outside world, the television images of violence and mayhem in the Liberian capital Monrovia reflect an entire country in chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Monrovia is just a small -- albeit bloody -- part of the West African nation. Outside the smoking city's gates, people in the countryside are trying to pick up the pieces of their lives after six-years of bitter civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the Ivoirian border in the north, all the way to Gbarngah -- 160km from Monrovia and the former headquarters of warlord Charles Taylor -- the countryside of Greater Liberia is relatively conflict-free.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To us, what is happening in Monrovia is just tales of distant troubles, we are not touched,&quot; declares Thomas Weh, a farmer at a hamlet on the Gbarngah road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He, like many other refugees, returned home with the signing of the August peace agreement in Abuja, Nigeria, lauded then as Liberia's best hope for stability and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although that agreement is now shot to pieces, the violence is yet to spill out of the capital. In the rest of Liberia, schools are functioning -- though on a limited basis -- - as are health facilities, despite supply shortages. Religious-minded people have even turned to rehabilitating their places of worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around Gbarngha at least, there is little evidence of the disease and hunger that aid agencies have sounded the alarm over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the way along the 260km road from Logoatou on the Ivoirian border to Gbarngah, patches of forest have been cleared for farming. Villagers testify that unlike the recent past when they were threatened and manhandled by swaggering boy soldiers, the climate has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are now very sober and tired of fighting each other so they do not harass us,'' said a farmer on the road.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the war the Liberian countryside was the theater of conflict between the competing warlords. Then Monrovia, under the protection of the West African peacekeeping force, Ecomog, was an island of tranquility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One Mauritanian shopkeeper at Saniquelle, a major town on the Gbarngah road, said he used to get his supplies from Monrovia after the roads were opened last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But now our supplies come in from Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire.&quot; Business is not booming he acknowledged: &quot;In war time nothing moves fast, but we are living, hoping that things will return to normal soon.&quot; -- IPS Now the situation is in reverse. Since Apr. 6, when Taylor and warlord ally Alhaji Kromah laid siege to Roosevelt Johnson and his Krahn militia turning Monrovia into a battle field, those that were able grabbed what possessions they could safely carry and streamed into the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to observers, Gbarngah's population for example has trebled to 30,000 from the 10,000 people in April, then mainly militia and their families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Most of us have no homes here, so we are always on the move. We have no choice,'' explains Mary Johnson, 28. Until the fighting in Monrovia she had never been out of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''In Monrovia we have a big house but that has been destroyed now making living in the capital dangerous for almost everyone apart from the warlords and the fighters,'' she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Relief Service and Save the Children Fund are the only relief agencies operating in Liberia. Their limited supply of mostly rice and maize to the rural population is being supplemented by farmers whose markets in Monrovia are now closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A local World Food Programme (WFP) member of staff said he reckons conditions are safe enough for the U.N. agency to move in again, but ''our heads claim the situation is too dangerous for now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Returning villagers are not only rehabilitating their former homes destroyed in a war that killed 150,000 people and turned half of the country's pre-war population of 2.5 million people into refugees, but even shops are re-opening.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - After nearly two years of investigation into the genocide of hundreds of the thousands of Rwandan Tutsis, the first Hutu extremists accused of mass murder were finally expected to appear before the international war crimes tribunal in Tanzania late this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They include Clement Kayishema, the former governor of Kibuye province and the highest- ranking Hutu official so far charged by the chief prosecutor, Judge Richard Goldstone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kibuye had the highest concentration of Tutsis in Rwanda before the genocide and among the most comprehensive records of killing. Witnesses are expected to testify that Kayishema encouraged more than</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10 000 Tutsis to seek shelter in a stadium and church by promising protection before personally firing the shot which launched their murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema has previously defended his actions by arguing that he tried to stop the killings but lacked sufficient troops to do so. However, there are believed to have been significant numbers of soldiers at an army base in the town. Some participated in the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayishema is also alleged to have led attacks on Tutsi refugees who gathered on hilltops in Kibuye province. They were still being murdered even after the French army moved into Rwanda, supposedly to protect the Tutsi population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two other accused also played important roles in the killing in other parts of Rwanda. George Anderson Rutaganda is the former vice- president of the interahamwe militia which spearheaded the genocide and spurred other, less willing participants into murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Appearing with him is Jean-Paul Akayesu, a former mayor in Gitarama province who was known as one of the most enthusiastic killers. He directed the slaughter in his village, Taba, where one of his specialties was to encourage Hutus to murder Tutsi members of their own families. Witnesses have reported that he said: &quot;Even a Tutsi foetus in its Hutu mother's stomach cannot be saved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All three men were arrested in Zambia. Kayishema had first fled to Zaire where he was employed by the aid organisation, the Order of Malta, as a doctor before disappearing to Lusaka where he was discovered living openly.  After pleas and the appointment of defence lawyers, the trials were expected to be postponed for several weeks while the attorneys consult the accused men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opening of the Rwanda tribunal comes after nearly two years of underfunded and understaffed investigation which many Tutsi survivors saw as a reflection of the world's indifference to their tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More indictments are expected to follow in the coming months. They are likely to include at least one member of the defunct Hutu extremist Cabinet which governed Rwanda during the genocide. But there is no sign of an early trial for the 70 000 Hutus packed into Rwandan prisons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - A senior adviser to Kenya's president is selling a government-funded &quot;miracle cure&quot; for Aids which, education workers say, has set back years of safe-sex projects, the most recent funded by a 26-million pound World Bank grant agreed to three months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Arthur Obel, a leading doctor and chief scientist in President Daniel arap Moi's office, launched &quot;Pearl Omega&quot; in March with much fanfare in the state press, the personal endorsement of Moi and praise from the administration in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the launch, thousands of the estimated 1-million Kenyans afflicted by Aids or being HIV positive have handed over Pounds 350 for a course of Pearl Omega, which comes in a wine bottle and is 5% proof.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-Kenyans are also among the buyers. In sub- Saharan Africa alone, 13-million people are infected with the virus. Within Kenya, about 60 000 of the sufferers are children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The drug is made by Biodiversity, a company set up specifically for the purpose with government funds, and headed by Moi's former press secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor Obel claims secret research proves that Pearl Omega causes a reversal of Aids symptoms and can even totally rid the body of the HIV virus.  But he has refused to reveal what is in Pearl Omega, to produce anyone who has benefited from the drug, or to hold himself accountable to Kenya's professional medical organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My critics want to know how I get from the source to the end point,&quot; he said. &quot;This means revealing the formula for my drug. No one knows the formula for Coca-Cola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics say he has used powerful political connections to intimidate the medical profession into an uncomfortable silence. Moi's office did not respond to requests for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aids groups are outraged, arguing that there is no hard evidence to back the claims for a drug for which some people hand over their life savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a health ministry board banned the sale of Pearl Omega in pharmacies two weeks ago, Professor Obel continues to dispense it from his medical practice, where emaciated Aids sufferers pack the waiting room for the supposed cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Millions of pounds of foreign aid, along with tons of free condoms, have been dedicated to persuading Kenyans to take Aids seriously. But Aids workers say they are running into increasing hostility from people who say safe sex no longer matters now that there is a cure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless they can be persuaded otherwise, the health ministry's estimates that the number of Kenyans infected with HIV will have risen by 60% at the end of the century, may be conservative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next week, the courts are to hear an application by the Kenya Aids Society aimed at forcing Professor Obel to reveal Pearl Omega's formula, to register it as a drug and to submit it to government pricing controls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia's vibrant but eccentric press is carrying reports claiming former president Kenneth Kaunda is training Arab &quot;terrorists&quot; in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda has been barred from standing in elections, because a recent, and bizarre constitutional amendment bars &quot;foreigners&quot; from seeking presidential office. A foreigner has been defined in the amendment as someone who, like Kaunda, who was born in Zambia but whose parents were not. Kaunda's parents were Malawians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time in decades, there are real fears political violence will spill onto the streets of Zambia's capital, Lusaka. While Zambians often worried about foreign raids from then-Rhodesia and South Africa because of Kaunda's support for liberation movements, not since the food riots in 1991 has there been any civil disturbance in Zambia -- and not since independence has there been any real political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as Zambia's constitutional debate hots up, opposition leaders are promising demonstrations and violence unless President Frederick Chiluba renounces his plans to prevent them standing against him in the country's elections this October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia's press is adding fuel to the fire by alleging that ex-president Kenneth Kaunda is training Arab hitmen in South Africa, using the Johannesburg-based Kaunda Foundation as a front for the training operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malcolm Freid, the foundation's head, says the allegations are &quot;off the wall&quot;, adding that Chiluba's Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) is resorting to bizarre tactics because &quot;it is frightened now -- very frightened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda's United National Independence Party, UNIP denies vehemently it is training people to invade Zambia and says it is opposed to violence. But Kaunda's deputy in the party, Senior Chief Inyambo Yeta, claims rioting may be inevitable &quot;when democracy is suppressed&quot; he said. &quot;Extremists will come along and their frustration will lead to trouble. I wouldn't rule out violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Kaunda has vowed to break the law, whatever the cost to himself: &quot;We broke British laws to gain independence and freedom,&quot; he said. &quot;And I will do it again now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pro-MMD newspapers are stoking the fires. &quot;Chiluba to be killed&quot; said the Weekly Chronicle, next to a picture of Chiluba with the cross of a telescope sight superimposed on his face. And another newspaper, the Sun, which made the Arab claim, said the &quot;terrorists&quot; would invade Zambia and depose the MMD. The paper published an old picture of a Renamo guerrilla.  Soldiers like this, pictured in Mozambique, are to move into Zambia, it claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda returned to Zambia on Tuesday after attending a former heads of state meeting with James Callaghan, Pierre Trudeau and Helmut Schmidt in Canada. He was greeted by several hundred UNIP supporters at Lusaka Airport and led a peaceful demonstration into the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time the procession reached the city's main post office, it had swelled to more than 1 000 and Zambian police dispersed the crowd, with Kaunda asking his supporters to return to their homes peacefully. It is illegal to hold a demonstration in Zambia without giving 14 days notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambians interviewed in the streets this week said they expected trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plagued by desperate economic woes and rising crime rates, Zambians philosophically shrug their shoulders and say the controversial law to ban opposition leaders on the grounds of parentage is &quot;unfair&quot;. &quot;If KK is unpopular, let Chiluba prove it in the elections,&quot; was the almost universal reaction to the proposed Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambians do have staggering problems, even without the present constitutional crisis. Overwhelming unemployment, crime and an economy teetering on the verge of collapse are everyday issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian businessmen worry that the country's trade imbalance is not sustainable and point to South Africa being more of a hindrance than a help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the constitutional crisis coming at a time of desperate economic constraints and fuel shortages, most observers feel Zambia is headed for unrest and civil disturbance which will further undermine Chiluba's attempts to rebuild his ailing country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The diminutive figure in the chintz-covered wing-chair is hoping her voice will hold out. Former Philippines president Corazon Aquino is about to give her umpteenth media interview of the day; will the speech she's to deliver later have to be whispered?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had a sore throat a couple of weeks ago ... the doctor said the only cure was to stop talking. Of course, that was impossible,&quot; she says. Of course. But one suspects that to tell Aquino something is impossible is to pull the trigger that switches her into defiant, can-do mode.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She's in South Africa on a fleeting six-day visit -- the guest of the United States- based Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, brought out to give the keynote address at the 1996 Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights. &quot;It didn't take me long to decide to accept,&quot; she says. &quot;I have long wanted to meet Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are significant parallels between the challenges she had to confront when she was catapulted into the presidency three years after the assassination of her political activist husband, Benigno Aquino, and those currently facing South Africa. Transforming government, achieving economic growth and uplifting the poor are just some of the items that were on her task list and now top Mandela's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aquino might come across as everybody's favourite aunt -- the kind one goes to for strong tea and wise counsel when disaster strikes -- but she won't dream of moralising. &quot;I don't think it would be proper for me to give your government counsel,&quot; she says, but she does have a message, and it carries the authority of wisdom born of bitter experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's basically this: empower the people. Build non-governmental organisations, develop a partnership between them and government, and pave the way for people to feel part of government and the achievement of national goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Having been brought into the presidency through people's power, I resolved to empower the people,&quot; she says. A new Constitution in 1987 restored democracy to the archipelago of islands where some 68-million Filipinos suffered under the yoke of dictator Ferdinand Marcos's martial law.  After taking power, Aquino cast the government's protective cloak over the NGOs that had worked in the shadows against the regime, and became chief advocate for the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'd meet with NGOs in the different sectors, listen to their grievances and requests. I'd ask them for their support for government actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact that I survived seven coup attempts is testimony to this working -- it was only possible with the support of the majority of people, and that included most of the military. Only a very small sector of the armed forces were involved in the coup attempts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She did not make herself available for re- election once her five-year term expired, endorsing instead her former secretary of defence, Fidel Ramos.  &quot;I always thought myself necessary only in the transition,&quot; she recalls. &quot;I felt I had fulfilled my pledge to the Filipino people and that it was time to move on. Also, I wanted to leave the presidency with my integrity intact.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She continues to work to strengthen the NGO sector, chairing the Benigno Aquino Foundation which assists the country's co-operative movement, and can be seen, wearing her trademark yellow, at rallies endorsing political candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She's the first to concede that the Philippines has its problems. Crime is rampant, and the economic boom seems to be widening, rather than closing, the gap between rich and poor. Democracy can be tedious, she says, but it has survived the strikes and coup attempts that scared off foreign investors during her reign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Marcos promised us bread and freedom, and we lost our freedom and he took our bread. We have been able to show we do better when we are free to choose and decide for ourselves. Your government has been in power only two years,&quot; she admonishes gently. &quot;You must be patient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Dr Trudy Thomas, Eastern Cape MEC for Health, was awarded the 1996 Nelson Mandela Award for Health and Human Rights on Wednesday night in recognition of nearly three decades' work among needy children and the poor in her region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The secret peace talks of the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party this week have opened the door for a new beginning between South Africa's fiercest political opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks, announced by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Frank Mdadlose, spell defeat for IFP hardliners, American constitutional lawyer Mario Ambrosini and fellow strategist Walter Felgate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdlalose referred to a &quot;third hand&quot; in the ongoing violence, and said a mutual acknowledgement of &quot;fatal mistakes&quot; by the ANC and IFP and a professed move toward &quot;consensus-seeking&quot; governance paved the way for a fresh peace effort. A multi-party peace summit had been scheduled for June 13.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit would precede the exit of the National Party's single MEC from the provincial Cabinet by one week -- an indication that the two parties, soon to be exclusive partners in both the national and provincial governments, are trying to set aside their differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of Natal political scientist Alexander Johnston said the IFP's weak position as a result of its previous strategies &quot;paved the way for the ANC to negotiate with the IFP in good faith&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP KwaZulu-Natal local government and housing MEC Peter Miller this week welcomed an out-of- court settlement in which his party agreed to repeal the controversial Ingonyama Trust Act, which he said had impeded housing delivery in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the move was a major backdown for IFP hardliners bent on wresting greater powers for the province via &quot;institutional conflict&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ingonyama Trust Act placed three million hectares of &quot;tribal&quot; land in trust under King Goodwill Zwelithini and it was a key plank in the IFP's programme to force central government concessions on provincial powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The out-of-court settlement was forged minutes before the Act was due to be debated in the Constitutional Court. It included acceptance by the IFP that moves to amend the Act in order to remove obstacles to development fell within the central government's ambit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party also agreed that electoral legislation passed by the province fell outside its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two contentious Bills aimed at preventing the central government from taking over the payment of provincial traditional leaders were the brunt of disparaging comments from several Constitutional Court judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the court still has to rule on these two Bills, the developments bode ill for the IFP's chances of forcing constitutional amendments through legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the latest developments, Johnston said: &quot;Things are certainly not going the IFP's way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest blows followed a series of failures for party strategists:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In March 1995, IFP leader Mango-suthu Buthelezi led his party in a walk-out from the Constitutional Assembly in a bid to force the ANC to honour its 1994 agreement to international mediation. Earlier this month, the Constitutional Assembly adopted the final national Constitution in the IFP's absence without mediation having taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Efforts to wring national concessions out of the ANC by passing a highly federal provincial Constitution for KwaZulu-Natal ran into trouble in February, when opposition parties forced major concessions out of hardline constitutional negotiator Felgate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In May 1995, a secret IFP strategy document disclosed the party's intention to use &quot;institutional conflict&quot; to force the central government to accede to its demands. Shortly afterwards, the party's provincial MECs declared a boycott of the Intergovernmental forums through which provincial MECs liaised with national ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MECs have now quietly returned to the forums, realising nobody would protect their interests in their absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Felgate played down the IFP's capitulation in the Constitutional Court, arguing that the party had merely &quot;exercised its democratic right to use the court to decide which interpretation of the Constitution is correct&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he saw no reason for the party to &quot;change course. The IFP will continue to try to put forward challenges to maximise its advantage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointed comments by the judges of the Constitutional Court included that certain things &quot;had not occurred&quot; to the drafters of the provincial legislation. It was suggested that the problem could lie with the party's constitutional adviser, Ambrosini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A provincial government lawyer this week said Ambrosini allowed his &quot;political agenda to cloud his legal judgment&quot;, resulting in problematic legislation. Ambrosini declined to comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnston said the IFP's hardline strategy had &quot;revealed splits in the party&quot;. While IFP support rested primarily on identity-based and constitutional issues, Miller's comments -- rooted in a frustration over impediments to delivery in his portfolio -- &quot;seemed to indicate that at least part of the IFP might prefer to focus on delivery issues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnston said the failure of the IFP's constitutional and legislative strategy, the effects of these on delivery and the relative success of the central government's security initiatives had forced the party on to the defensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question remaining is whether the ANC will see this as sufficient reason to negotiate with the IFP,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President Thabo Mbeki recently suggested some form of negotiation could be sought after the Constitutional Court decided on the fate of the provincial Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdlalose's announcement that IFP provincial leaders were in Cape Town discussing the breakthrough with Buthelezi, and that the ANC was similarly engaged with President Nelson Mandela, underscored the importance of this week's peace talks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - It seems inevitable South Africa's first expedition to Everest should have ended with recriminations and a threatened law suit following the Pyrrhic victory of its summit assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internal rows, a sponsorship pull-out and a widely held assessment that the team was second-rate -- after the three most experienced members pulled out on arrival at the mountain -- have left the enterprise seeped in controversy. The rainbow nation had failed to cohere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of a hero's welcome team leader Briton Ian Woodall will return to a barrage of criticism over his decision to allow British photographer Bruce Herrod to make the final fatal ascent alone, some seven hours behind himself and South African climber, Cathy O'Dowd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Record-breaking British mountaineer Chris Bonnington told Radio 702 that a more experienced climber would have realised that there was only a 50:50 chance of anyone surviving the night on the mountain wearing only a down suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andre Schoon, president of the Mountain Club of South Africa, joined the list of experienced climbers who have accused Woodall of making a bad judgment call. He said it was not normal for a relatively inexperienced climber to go for the summit alone. &quot;If the summit bid was planned that way, I would consider that that inherently involved an unacceptably high risk for Herrod.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Bonnington agreed with Woodall (39) and O'Dowd's (27) insistence that it was not unusual for a team to split up during the last stage of the ascent and fend for themselves. &quot;Everest is a solo climb,'' said Woodall. &quot;I was not surprised when he insisted on going on. He's a man and entitled to make his own decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He and O'Dowd met Herrod on their way down from the peak. They sat and talked with him for a while, but did not try to dissuade him from attempting the summit and then descending alone in the dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have enough trouble worrying about myself,&quot; Woodall told Radio 702.  &quot;The weather was perfect and he had plenty of time to make it. If he had a problem he could have radioed and we would have gone back to fetch him,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ed February, one of those who resigned from the expedition because of Woodall's &quot;dictatorial and dangerous leadership&quot;, said he would have tried to persuade Herrod to turn back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would not have been happy with his straggling seven hours behind.  That's a long time not to keep up. It is the window needed to get from camp two to the summit. Herrod did not have the experience to come down from Everest in the middle of the night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He suggested that a possible reason for the time lag was that &quot;Herrod had been left at camp two and then decided to set off behind his team mates.  I'm inclined to think that something went very wrong before the final ascent.  There are too many unanswered questions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February described O'Dowd as being &quot;driven by an overriding ambition to climb the mountain at any cost&quot; and Herrod as an ego maniac in search of fame and glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herrod (37) reached the top after 5pm. His girlfriend Sue Thompson said he had promised not to ascend the summit after midday. But the seduction of the mountain was too strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is assumed he missed his footing and slipped on his way from the summit. His tragic death brought to 11 the number of lives claimed by Everest in its busiest month of the year, when human traffic up and down its slopes is reminiscent of a busy highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well-known rock climber Chris Lomax, from Cape Town who has been mountaineering for nearly 25 years, said: &quot;The problem is that too many inexperienced people are being allowed up the mountain just because they can pay for the trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the relaxation of the Nepalese government's once stringent numerical limit, Everest has become a chaotic playground for the rich and pleasure-seeking. It is the ultimate high and one of the country's major money-spinners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From what I have read it seems that all three climbers were relative novices on big mountains and probably should not have been there. The whole thing seems to have been more of a publicity stunt with a number of token figures,&quot; said Lomax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole team seem to have been mischosen and that might have been the reason for the lack of cohesion, though I do agree that at that altitude you can't really stop someone doing something they are hell-bent on doing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does that leave the perennial image of one mountaineer tied by rope to another, depending for his life on another? It would seem there is no longer a code. Today's climbers are a hard breed. Friendship, closeness to nature, building up relationships with the mountain have disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the words of Norwegian expedition leader Jon Gangdal: &quot;Now it's attack, in old- fashioned siege style, and climbers have to reach the summit at any price. People are even willing to walk over dead bodies to get to the top.&quot; A widely respected figure, this was his second trip to Everest and he has sworn not to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> O'Dowd (the first woman from African to climb Everest) has confessed that she was too concerned with making her climb to the top to feel any spiritual connection with the mountain. Woodall has described how he stepped over frozen bodies in his quest for glory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It had all started so differently for the South Africans who were sent off by a nation eager to continue making its mark in the world sporting arena after successes in international rugby, football and cricket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela (whose Children's Fund was able to raise money by sponsoring the trip) told them that by just trying they would bring honour to the nation. But from the moment they landed in Katmandu things started to go wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sole black woman on the team, Deshun Deysel, found that her name was not on the all-important permit needed to climb -- but Woodall's 69-year-old father's name was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 25-year-old teacher did not have the $10 000 needed to buy a new one and was not able to go beyond base camp while the others were able to make altitude acclimatising trips up the mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When O'Dowd's wealthy parents decided to cough up money for Deysel's permit, it was too late for her to catch up with the programme.  Mountaineering experts argue that she would never have made it in any case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A series of rows over Woodall's dictatorial style of leadership led to the departure of Ed February, Andy de Klerk and Andy Hackland (three of South Africa's top climbers).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woodall sold one of their vacant places to a French climber. His row with journalists from the Sunday Times, the initial and main sponsors, led to the paper withdrawing support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to editor Brian Pottinger an undisclosed sum had already been paid up front: &quot;Our view is that there has been a clear breach of contract.  We are considering whether to take it any further, and the matter is in the hands of our lawyers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Some of the country's finest human rights lawyers -- people who usually found themselves on the same side during the apartheid era -- were lined up against each other in the Constitutional Court this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> David Soggot, SC, a Johannesburg advocate who handled some of the most important civil rights cases in the apartheid era, represents the families of Steve Biko, Griffiths Mexenge and Fabian and Florence Ribeiro in their attack against the Truth Commission's amnesty provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gilbert Marcus, SC, a heavyweight civil rights barrister and specialist on South Africa's new Constitution, is defending the Truth Commission and Justice Department against the application.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dennis Davis, professor of law at the University of Cape Town and star of the television show Future Imperfect, has suggested a possible compromise position to Constitutional Court president Arthur Chaskalson, himself a veteran of legal challenges against apartheid, and his team of judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soggot argues the Truth Commission's abililty to give perpetrators of human rights abuse indemnity against civil and criminal prosecutions violates international law and legal rights of individuals that are entrenched in the Constitution. He says the amnesty rules also infringe international law by exonerating the state of its duty to pay compensation for damages by security force officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marcus argues the postcript of the Constitution specifically calls for the creation of a truth body to promote reconciliation and states that amnesty for perpetrators of human rights abuse be used as a mechanism for achieving this. He says the Geneva Convention states, in fact, that governments should endeavour to grant &quot;the widest possible amnesty&quot; at the end of armed conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davis's submission, made in the true spirit of reconciliation on behalf of the Centre for Applied Legal Studies in Johannesburg, agrees it is unconstitutional for victims to lose their right to damages from the state .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Davis does not back Soggot's plea for the amnesty laws to be shelved. He suggests, instead, that perpetrators be given amnesty - -- thus encouraging them to come forward and confess to the Truth Commission -- while victims retain their right to state compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The uncertain fate of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's only son has edged the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's focus away from security force abuses towards the largely untold history of the liberation movements in exile -- and the organisations' lapses and injustices towards those in their own fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stories told by victims of apartheid crime still dominate the proceedings of the Truth Commission, but a trend in testimony, including that last week by the missing son's mother, suggests more firmly now that both sides of the apartheid divide will have to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said one of the commission's investigators, who asked not to be named: &quot;What is weird is that there are other cases of people who are coming before the commission about people who went into exile, both ANC and PAC, who just disappeared ... The liberation armies are keeping mum about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A potentially more damaging story about ANC abuse in exile is likely to be heard by the Truth Commission soon. This week the father of top Umkhonto weSizwe commander Thami Zulu -- who died, apparently poisoned, days after his release from lengthy incarceration in Lusaka -- gave notice to the commission of his desire to testify. An internal ANC inquiry in 1990 failed to provide conclusive answers over Zulu's death, but did highlight persistent problems in the treatment of detainees. (See story below.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the ANC should be held responsible for the disappearance of Monwabisi, born from a youthful romance and Mbeki's only child, is a moot point. But the nagging possibility that he was last seen in the ANC fold in Tanzania in the mid-1980s, a number of years after he was last seen in South Africa, does raise that question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transkei nurse Nokwanda Mpahlwa told a Truth Commission hearing in Port Elizabeth last Thursday that Monwabisi had disappeared in 1981 at the age of 21, but that friends of her son later told her they had met him in Europe and a &quot;military camp&quot; in Tanzania in 1985. She asked the commission to help find out what happened to him. &quot;Put me out of my agony,&quot; was her request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While her testimony -- and an account this week by the deputy president's father, Govan Mbeki -- suggests Monwabisi may well have reached exile and joined the ANC, Thabo Mbeki's version veers towards the likelihood that his son had never reached exile, and had possibly been the victim of an apartheid death squad in 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Govan Mbeki this week told the Mail &amp; Guardian Monwabisi had been legally adopted by his family when he was 10 years old, and looked after and put through school by his wife. In 1981 Monwabisi joined a trade school in Vereeniging, but left saying he was going to search for family in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was the last the elder Mbekis heard of Monwabisi until after Govan Mbeki's release from prison in 1989. &quot;I got to London after my release. There I met some of his co-students who came from the same area as he did in the Transkei. They said they had parted with him in Tanzania, when he said he was going to Cuba. I carried the search to Cuba, but also without success,&quot; he said, adding it was not clear from these accounts whether Monwabisi had in fact joined the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It can only be the assumption that virtually all the young people (who left South Africa) were keen to join MK or to further their studies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The elder Mbeki said Thabo Mbeki &quot;did not have that part of the story.  The story he had went as far as southern Transvaal and Durban.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thabo Mbeki's representative Ricky Naidoo this week confirmed that was the deputy president's conclusion. &quot;When he was told his son had disappeared and might have left for exile, he tried exhaustively to find out with ANC contacts, but his conclusion was that he had not reached exile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo said Monwabisi had left the trade school in Vereeniging in 1981 to find Thabo Mbeki's cousin Phindile Mfeti in Durban, but never reached Mfeti, who at about that time also disappeared mysteriously. One explanation was that both, who had been involved in student politics at the time, could have been victims of an &quot;assassination squad&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Mbeki returned from exile in 1990 he inquired with the police, but this also failed to turn up leads. Naidoo said the disappearance had been a source of sorrow to the deputy president and &quot;something he'd been carrying inside himself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thami Zulu's death, &quot;disappearances&quot; in the liberation fold in exile, and torture and deaths in detention centres in the frontline states, some of which have been well documented but have so far not prompted the ANC to act against individual transgressors, are likely to add to the pressure on the ANC to finally give a full account of its years in exile -- to the Truth Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early 1990s criticism of the ANC mounted over human rights abuses in its camps in Tanzania, Angola and Zambia. The organisation responded with the Skweyiya Commission of 1992. It found serious breaches amounting to &quot;staggering brutality&quot; and recommended urgent action against individuals &quot;responsible for the maltreatment of detainees&quot;. Nelson Mandela accepted the ANC leadership's collective responsibility, but insisted individuals could not be singled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still under pressure, the ANC appointed the independent Motsuenyane Commission the following year. It came to similar conclusions. The ANC again accepted the findings, but argued action could not be taken against individual members as long as the National Party and security forces did not do the same. The organisation then called for the establishment of a Truth Commission to &quot;investigate all the violations of human rights ... from all quarters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But whether the ANC will now deliver individual transgressors to the Truth Commission remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Truth Commission, for its part, may be hampered by the fact that these abuses occurred in foreign countries. Its leverage over individuals who committed crimes in South Africa lies in the fact that those who do not confess will not get indemnity and may be prosecuted in South African courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the liberation movements who were guilty of hu-man rights abuses in the frontline states have little to fear from South African law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A publisher has uncovered a potentially massive book piracy operation in KwaZulu- Natal, but believes police are reluctant to investigate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Southern Books publisher Basil Van Rooyen was alerted to forgeries of a mathematics technical college textbook being sold at a Durban-based book shop -- Premier University Book Shop in Field Street -- earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The book shop is owned by businessman Nel Bisseru, whose family owns various book shops, outlets and library services supplying books to the University of Durban-Westville, ML Sultan Technikon, Natal Technikon and schools and libraries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Rooyen discovered the pirate operation when another Durban-based book distributor asked him several months ago why Premier University Book Shop was still selling the textbook when his own shop had not received any more copies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Rooyen said he realised something was amiss, since he knew the book was out of print. He asked a colleague to purchase the textbook from Premier University Book Shop and on examining the book, found it was a pirated version.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forged books have been bound with &quot;perfect binding&quot;, meaning the pages are glued straight to the spine, as opposed to the genuine articles which are &quot;section sewn&quot;. The forged books can also be distinguished by their contrasting bold and light typeface and their softer covers, which curl up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed with affidavits, including one from the printer of the genuine book, who concluded the replica had been photographed, Van Rooyen went to Durban in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was under the impression that police, confronted with the evidence, would raid Bisseru's book shop. However, Van Rooyen says he was simply passed from one investigating officer to the next and discouraged from pursuing the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain A Hemraj, from the police criminal unit in Durban, denied police were holding back on the investigation. &quot;We are busy with the investigation which we will then pass on to the courts to make a decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The textbook's selling price is R42,95. According to Van Rooyen, the manufacturing cost is only six rand per book. This means the forgers could pocket a profit of R37 for every book sold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attempts to contact Bisseru for comment were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we are aware of could be the tip of the iceberg. The piracy could involve millions of books which are being counterfeited. My big worry is if this kind of thing continues we'll slide to the level of countries like Burma where -- because of the levels of piracy -- - no one wants to do business,&quot; said Van Rooyen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owen Dean, an attorney specialising in copyright law, said police were traditionally reluctant to pursue what they perceive to be civil law infringements. While Johannesburg police have shown a willingness to act in cases of piracy of books, records, videos and computer software, &quot;Durban has traditionally been a difficult area&quot; -- ostensibly because of the violence and police manpower problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dean encouraged publishers to pursue civil cases if they seek justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Technology is the biggest threat to copyright, said Dean, &quot;because it makes reproduction so easy and cost-effective&quot;. Currently, international publishing groups are putting their heads together to find ways of maintaining ownership of &quot;intellectual property&quot; once it hits the information highway on the Internet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Government and labour will square up over privatisation on June 15, at the first meeting of parties under the National Framework Agreement (NFA), signed in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela's statement on his return from Germany -- to the effect that privatisation was &quot;fundamental policy&quot; of the African National Congress and would be implemented -- will add impetus to the meeting. Public Enterprises minister Stella Sigcau followed up this week, saying she was confident the unions could be brought on board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NFA sets out principles and procedures for restructuring state assets and pulls together government ministries and the three labour federations: the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the National Council of Trade Unions (Nactu) and the Federation of South African Labour (Fedsal).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides have been preparing their positions. Stephen Rix, a researcher with the National Labour and Economic Development Institute (Naledi), which has been appointed by the union federations as the co-ordinating body for labour's research effort, said state funds had been provided for labour to employ its own advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rix said work had been done by affected unions within each of the federations, but this had to be &quot;massaged and assessed&quot;. A key item on the agenda for the meeting was time-frames.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the problem with the process, which has been in stop-start mode since government's first announcement on privatisation in June 1994, was it had run ahead of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Entities that wanted strategic equity partners got going, but the government had yet to put a macro-economic framework in place,&quot; said one source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government was under pressure from &quot;vultures (foreign investors) who want to buy and merchant bankers who want big fees for handling the sales&quot;, but government first had to complete the process of maximising the value of the assets it would sell through re- engineering and getting rid of loss-making entities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source in the Public Enterprises ministry said it was felt &quot;enough preliminary exploratory discussion analysis&quot; had been done and it was time to get a move on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an address to the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, Cosatu secretary general Sam Shilowa reiterated the federation's position that it was in favour of restructuring of state assets as a means of achieving upliftment and the goals of reconstruction and development, but was opposed to privatisation being the central tool for doing so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the absence of any macro-economic plan, government was looking to selling off state assets to bolster its fiscus when it should be looking at reprioritising spending and investigating what the private sector was prepared to do in terms of dealing with job losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naledi economist Ravi Naidoo said Shilowa's speech was indicative of a more flexible position, but he was essentially saying the same thing. &quot;Cosatu is saying to government, if you have a plan, come and show us how it fits into the bigger pie. You can't just say that because there's a problem with the economy we have to sell state assets because that's the trend internationally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The left recognises the bankruptcy of a command economy, but is just as opposed to the neo-liberalism of the Thatcherite model. South African Communist Party deputy general secretary and ANC national executive committee member, Jeremy Cronin, told the Mail &amp; Guardian of a &quot;confused adherence to neo- liberalism by some within the ANC, who are under the illusion that one can glue neo- liberal economics on to Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) aims&quot;. But this tendency did not represent a shift to the right by the ANC, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Thatcherite model had &quot;never worked, and least of all in a country emerging from war or from third-world under-development&quot;. But a Stalinist model of wholesale nationalisation was equally misguided, he said, affirming the party's commitment to &quot;the RDP model, growth through development and development through growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We need business in that process. We need to find ways of encouraging the private sector into that process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, &quot;if the ANC became a centrist, Tony Blair kind of party it would lose its constituency&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - While Africa's largest banking group, Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa), unveiled a 50% surge in profits this week, it failed to declare to what extent its figures were buoyed by the tail-end of a R1,125- billion gift from the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gift was the controversial five-year secret &quot;lifeboat&quot; the Reserve Bank threw to Bankorp (the then parent company of TrustBank) in 1990 when Bankorp was close to collapse. Absa bought Bankorp two years later and with it, the boon of the lifeboat. The gift, or lifeboat, fed the Absa group with about R225- million a year until last October.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the Reserve Bank and Absa had agreed to secrecy on the lifeboat, the banking conglomerate did not acknowledge its existence until November last year when, in a nationwide advertising campaign, it came clean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lifeboat has often been presented as a loan which Absa has fully repaid, but in fact it was a gift. The Reserve Bank gave Bankorp government bonds at a 1% interest rate, which Absa then sold back to the Reserve Bank at an interest rate of between 15% and 18%. The fruits of this deal were the lifeboat Absa inherited when it bought Bankorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absa's upbeat financial results for the year to March -- which boasted profits of R1,13- billion -- was its first opportunity since it broke its Reserve Bank-imposed silence to explain to its shareholders how the lifeboat helped it, and them, out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there was no mention of the Reserve Bank package, which had originally been given to Bankorp to help it write off a string of debts owed to it, including some from the troubled conglomerate, Tollgate. None of the debts supposedly written off by the Reserve Bank's lifeboat have been mentioned in the accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absa has said nothing about repaying the Reserve Bank, and the Ministry of Finance said this week it had yet to look into possible action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its results, Absa also failed to note that it had enjoyed a R51-million injection from Sanlam. In 1992, Sanlam -- which was a major shareholder in Bankorp -- said it would give Absa R51-million a year for the next 10 years when Absa bought Bankorp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absa said Sanlam's injection was irrelevant as it went towards repaying a debt to Absa. The bank said the Reserve Bank lifeboat did not figure in the annual accounts because it had no impact on current results. Absa said it will only repay the money if there is any left over after writing off bad debts. It will deal with the Bankorp package in its annual report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing Absa's results on Monday, chief executive Danie Cronje said Absa's strategy this coming year included an offshore expansion drive.  Lawyers say it is likely that higher standards of corporate disclosure abroad will force Absa to reveal more about financial implications of the the Reserve Bank lifeboat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - &quot;Trust nobody,&quot; scream the walls of a Hanover Park tenement building on the Cape Flats. Not only is the message scrawled in crude black ink, but the disrepair of the buildings, the rubbish lifting in the wind and the belligerent poverty of the area testify to the fact that politicians have not yet bought the Hanover Park community &quot;A better life for all&quot;, promised by the African National Congress since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the queue at the Hanover Park polling station this Wednesday during the Western Cape local government elections was long and patient. Residents arrived at the gates to the polling booths throughout the day, ID books in hand, to select a politician to represent them on local councils. As in many areas in the poorer parts of Cape Town, posters were few and far between, and voting was a low-key event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Not much problems here,&quot; said an official. &quot;Just, people can't understand why they must vote three times. But we have explained that to them ...&quot; He broke off to talk to an elderly man who wanted to vote, but who had not registered. As we got back into the car to continue our tour, the elderly man limped away from the polling station on his own, clutching his ID book, without having cast his vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Back on the road, the line of posters got thinner and thinner the further away from Cape Town centre we went. Between Nyanga and Philippi, there were one or two ANC posters on the lampposts, and then suddenly an unexpected Democratic Party poster, stuck in the middle of shackland. On closer inspection, it became clear that the DP poster was serving as an important part of a shack wall, and was not a clear sign of support for DP leader Tony Leon. At a small squatter settlement called Phola Park, I asked a woman who she was voting for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The National Party,&quot; she said. &quot;Where's your money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't have any money,&quot; I answered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I vote NP if you give me money ... where's your money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On realising that she had no chance of getting anything, she burst out: &quot;This is ANC, go away NP, this is ANC.&quot; As we retreated to the car, small groups of women shouted, &quot;ANC! ANC!&quot; and held up their fists, half in salute and half in anger. The men looked up with amusement from their card games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around the corner, a man festooned in ANC paraphernalia also asked for money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petrol pump attendant Arthur Mduzulwana was, however, grateful for an apple, and gave &quot; a statement&quot; to the media: &quot;I vote for the ANC because it is going to make my life here easier ... The NP is lying. We like FW as our ex-president, but he must not gossip about the ANC as he does. The ANC will give us houses, water and jobs for all people so the crime rate is not so high. Nelson Mandela is our president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's voting place, Westerford High School on Rondebosch Main Road, seemed a world away from Phola Park on the Cape Flats. Mandela strode out of his official residence Genadendal on Wednesday morning, with the ANC candidate, city architect Revel Fox, at his side. They were mobbed by photographers, by Fox's groupies and by curious passers-by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neatly maroon-jacketed school girls and boys and their families waited for Mandela with tea and biscuits and a choir performance. Local Rondebosch families were agog as he shook hands, talking here and there with his characteristic ease, and bubbles of hysteria mounted among the young people, especially the teenage girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He touched my hand, he touched my hand,&quot; shouted one, staring at her thumb and forefingers as if she wanted to chop them off and preserve them in a jar of aspic until kingdom come. Mandela had impact, but most of the excitement faded after he left in the middle of the morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fox team made the boldest splash of all in Rondebosch, with a table and stands and many bright posters, swamping the other parties, which relied on posters on lampposts to make their statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By midday, it became clear that the winner of the best election poster award just had to go to Nando's. Posters placed throughout the city proclaimed the fast-food outlet's message: &quot;Food for all&quot;; &quot;We stand for family values&quot;; &quot;Vote for the left and the right wing&quot;; &quot;No foul play&quot;; &quot;Against battered chicken&quot;; &quot;Simply the breast&quot;; &quot;Now you've made your mark, have your lunch&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nando's put the other election messages in the shade. The NP had a selection, including the grim &quot;Death penalty for murderers&quot; and the fantastical &quot;Save the rand&quot;. The ANC stuck to the tried and tested &quot;Make it happen in your ward&quot; and &quot;Die NP het misluk&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Freedom Front ignored the volkstaat with &quot;Equal rights for equal service&quot; and the Conservative Party hit out at the NP with &quot;Geen blanke tjek vir FW/ANC&quot;. The African Christian Democratic Party preached &quot;Morality, stability, accountability&quot;, &quot;Ensuring your family's future&quot; and &quot;No slogans, just action&quot;. The DP boasted: &quot;More meat less gravy&quot;, &quot;Bang vir niks&quot; and &quot;Tough, capable, determined&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was difficult to find many signs of the DP outside the traditionally white areas, but in Delft there was a small outpost -- a house covered with DP posters. It was the Delft undertaker's house. The undertaker, Stanley van der Bergh, brought his own touch to the DP message, adding to posters the words &quot;Join the DP for peace&quot; and &quot;Set the Cape free&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was probable that the Delft community would stick to its traditional voting lines of ANC and NP, but he hoped there might be a swing to the DP, &quot;because the DP is the party of delivery and businessmen. They are the people who fight for us in Parliament, not the NP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election agents and party workers confirmed at different polling stations that one of the problems in this election was that people were confusing local issues with national policy, and would probably still continue to vote along the lines they did in the 1994 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this local government election was altogether much calmer and flatter than that of 1994. Despite administrative hitches and some confusion in the townships about registration, the voting process was smooth - -- unexpectedly so after the rough and ready final election campaigns, during which the NP and ANC jostled each other for the coloured vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An NP supporter in Mitchell's Plain was dismissive of the ANC on Wednesday. &quot;I lost my job, you see, three years ago, in the bakeries ... It was when the unions came in. Cosatu gave money to the ANC and that is why they are a party now ... it's my money. I used to get R3 000 a month, now I am getting R250 a week and I am glad to have a job.&quot; He walked away in disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MPs, especially those from up-country, said they were appalled at the crudeness of the approach of some of the NP supporters they encountered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One told this story the day before the elections: &quot;We were campaigning in Mitchell's Plain and these tannies lifted up their skirts and said, 'See that, it belongs to FW de Klerk, not to you.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MP rolled his eyes in prudish disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the time of going to print, insufficient results had come in to be able to decide whether De Klerk got lucky on the Cape Flats, but the first signs indicated the NP was keeping the ground it won during the election of 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - The African peacekeeping force ECOMOG claimed on May 29 to have taken &quot;firm&quot; control in central Monrovia following redeployment of its troops throughout the city, the force's chief of staff said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a tour of the capital, Brigadier General Gabriel Anyankpele told newsmen he was satisfied that the deployment operation, which began on May 26, had been completed &quot;smoothly and peacefully without any obstruction from any of the parties&quot; to factional fighting which flared up in early April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyankpele urged residents who have fled their homes to return and take charge of their &quot;remaining belongings,&quot; promising that the peacekeepers would &quot;do everything to protect them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said an early return of civilians &quot;is the only was they can protect what is left of their homes.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyankpele said his tour, conducted on May 28, took him to the diplomatic enclave of Mamba Point, the military Barclay Training Centre (BTC), the presidential Executive Mansion, and Monrovia's eastern Congotown and Paynesville suburbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most civilians were still reluctant to return home for fear of an outbreak of renewed fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first time in seven weeks, a convoy carrying badly needed relief food to displaced centres on May 28 drove on the Gabriel Tucker bridge (new bridge), the scene of prolonged fierce factional fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other parts of Monrovia, Liberia's only reliable safe haven for the past six years until early April when the fighting broke out, residents began cleaning up the debris left by the street violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owners of stores and shops in central Monrovia were busy cleaning around their stores offering electronic devices, video players, refrigerators, spare parts and other accessories for vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the streets were still strewn with human bodies and left covered with debris including huge piles of garbage, burnt vehicles, broken window panes and bottles as well as heaps of torn merchandise cartons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faction leader and ruling council of state member Charles Taylor, on May 28 said he was contributing some five tonnes of rice towards a government-sponsored clean-up campaign for the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carey and Benson streets, which lead to Greystone near the US Embassy, where more than 20,000 civilians are refuged, have become the busiest routes in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The streets were also clogged by several thousand suburban dwellers heading to Greystone to trace friends and relatives unseen during the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prices of food commodities were skyrocketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the same day, a spokesman from the Ministry of Health said a team comprising personnel from the ministry, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), was preparing to collect bodies still lying in some streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on May 22 recommended that the 25 members of the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) be maintained in Liberia until August 31, despite sporadic eruption of heavy factional fighting that has been preventing them from doing their job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Boutros-Ghali warned that the UNOMIL presence depended on that of African peacekeepers of the ECOMOG force and that if they were withdrawn, &quot;UNOMIL would have no choice but to do the same.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali recalled that when UNOMIL was set up in September 1993 &quot;it was clearly recognised that unarmed UN military observers would require the provision of security by ECOMOG in order to fulfil their mandated tasks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Boutros-Ghali said that &quot;ECOMOG has not been able to provide the level of security necessary for UNOMIL personnel to function in Liberia, or to fulfil entirely its own responsibilities as a peacekeeping force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This was amply demonstrated by the events of the past few weeks,&quot; during which factional fighting erupted in Monrovia, Boutros-Ghali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Secretary General also said that the problem of looted equipment during the unrest had to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the UN was currently attempting to assess the value of goods and equipment looted by Liberian fighters, which included 80 per cent of UNOMIL vehicles taken, and many destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the wholesale looting, UNOMIL telephones, computers, photocopiers, communications equipment were among the stolen items, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algeria - The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Algiers, Monsignor Henri Teissier, vowed on May 27 that Christian priests planned to stay in the country despite the recent murder by extremists of seven French Trappist monks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview here by the daily La Tribune, Teissier, who is French said: &quot;We decided to stay because we know that we have the support of our friends and all those who work with us, as well as our neighbours who accept our presence and who have cultural and friendly relations with us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The archbishop added that he did not doubt the authenticity of the communique from the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) which said that the seven monks kidnapped in March had been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the announcement, France reiterated its call for its 300 or so nationals still in Algeria to leave the country or risk the same fate as dozens of foreigners killed by fundamentalists in the last four years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extremist groups, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and other fundamentalist Islamic groups, launched an armed insurrection against the secular authorities after the army stepped in to cancel the second round of legislative elections in January 1992, which the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vow to stay on in Algeria came as protests and controversy were mounting against extremists over the murder of the monks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Paris, French police said that around 10,000 people took to the streets on the evening of May 28 to protest the murder of the seven monks in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crowd, which included Prime Minister Alain Juppe and politicians from all parties as well as trade union and religious leaders, met at the Place du Trocadero, many wearing white carnations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two huge banners were unfurled, reading: &quot;If we are silent, the stones will cry out.&quot; A minute's silence for the dead was followed by music from Samuel Barber and Gustav Mahler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extremists Armed Islamic Group, one of the most radical groups fighting the Algerian government since it annulled elections in January 1992, said it killed the Trappist monks last week, nearly two months after their abduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Juppe made no comment, but signed a book of condolences. French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette however said: &quot;We did all in our power to get the monks out of the claws holding them.&quot; The rally was called for by Education Minister Francois Bayrou, who said it was to demonstrate the solidarity of all sections of French society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the religious figures was Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the archbishop of Paris, leaders of the Jewish community in France and the Imam Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of the Muslim Shiite community in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former Socialist Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy said: &quot;It was the least we could do to honour those who were massacred and to demonstrate our readiness to unite against barbarism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier on May 27, trade unions had urged their members to participate and the rector of the Paris mosque's Muslim Institute, Dalil Boubakeur, had also urged &quot;all Muslims of France whatever their opinions to take part in this gathering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mufti of Marseille Mosque Soheib Bencheikh likewise called on Muslims of France to attend the demonstration in protest at the killing of the monks whose murder was claimed by the Islamic Armed Group (GIA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A memorial mass was celebrated on May 26 for the monks at the Cistercian Abbey of Aiguebelle in south-west France. Father Yves de Broucker, the superior used the occasion to call for &quot;reconciliation&quot; in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let us pray that the fate of our seven brothers may sow the seeds of reconciliation among the Algerian people and peace for the Church of Algeria,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The abbey of Notre Dame d'Aiguebelle near Monjoyer in the Drome region, founded in 1934 the monastery in Tiberihine near Medea in the Atlas mountains, where the seven monks were seized during a raid in March.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mutiny left 43 people dead, 11 of them soldiers, and injured 238, Patasse said on May 29 in an address to the nation, quoting Red Cross figures. Of the injured, 212 were civilians and 26 were soldiers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A European diplomatic source here had earlier said that the civilian casualty toll was 32 killed and 212 injured in the bloody revolt before it ended on May 26, and that most of these civilians were killed or injured by stray bullets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutineers, who were estimated by a French military source to number about 500, out of a total 4,000 Central African Republic troops, had previously negotiated only with General Bernard Thorette, in charge of the French military operation that supported the government during the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting had taken place between mutineers and loyalists, as well as between rebel soldiers and French troops sent in to prop up the Patasse regime in this former French colony where Paris maintains one of its key military bases in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebel soldiers agreed on May 26 to a general return to the Kasai military barracks in the eastern part of Bangui, after Patasse promised them amnesty, ending the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiations on May 29 would focus on the preparation of an amnesty law, an informed source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, opposition groups in the Central African Republic on May 28 laid out their conditions for entering a government of national unity under President Ange Felix Patasse in the wake of a 10-day mutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The umbrella group, Democratic Council of Opposition Parties (CODEPO) called for a change in the constitution to give the Prime Minister more powers, and for it to nominate a premier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also called for a conference of national reconciliation, for arms given to civilians during the mutiny to be handed back, for a consensus between the army and Patasse, and an amnesty for the mutineers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patasse, in an accord signed with the rebel soldiers on May 26, had already agreed to an amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said then he was taking steps to form a government of national unity which &quot;will call on all legal political groups and civilian society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mutiny was sparked by attempts to disarm soldiers who had taken part in another mutiny a month earlier over unpaid wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Paris that a government of national unity was essential to restore stability to the Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spokesman said the accord, which was brokered by the French military commander in Bangui, was being implemented with the return of mutinous troops to their barracks, leaving French troops to patrol the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bujumbura - At least 59 people have been butchered in Burundi following an attack by Hutu rebels on Tutsis at a displaced people's camp in the eastern part of the country, the Burundian army officially announced on May 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The army had initially said at least 51 people died in the May 28 attack by Hutu rebels who set fire to 74 huts in the camp at Butezi, in the eastern province of Ruhigi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence Ministry spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani said another 25 people were seriously injured and that many others were missing. He said the assailants had also been involved in an earlier attack on the Tutsi-dominated army in the neighbouring province of Gitega.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The military announcement came only hours after the French government announced in Paris that it was suspending its military cooperation because of &quot;security problems&quot; and the political deadlock paralysing this tiny central African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement, the French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that all of 23 French military advisers that were in Burundi as at April 15, will have left the war-torn country by June 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The minimum conditions necessary for military cooperation to function well are no longer there. We have therefore decided to suspend our military cooperation with Burundi until a comprehensive political settlement has put an end to the violence and committed the country to the path of national reconciliation,&quot; the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi has been in the throes of ethnic violence for more than two years since an attempted coup in October 1993 in which Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first President from the majority Hutus, was killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former Belgian colony and UN trusteeship, Burundi achieved independence in 1962.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France had less than 10 civilian advisers in Burundi, but they were also being reduced, the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, UN officials are seeking commitments from member countries for a possible emergency operation in Burundi, which has been ravaged by new violence between Tutsis and Hutus, UN sources said on May 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN peacekeeping chief Kofi Annan chaired a planning meeting at UN headquarters with representatives of several countries, including France as an observer, a UN official said. A similar meeting was held on May 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official said Annan was giving priority to a negotiated solution in the African state but that rapid &quot;contingency&quot; plans were being examined in the event of a wider outbreak of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> France had refused to attend the earlier session organised by the United States, claiming that only countries willing to join a UN force should participate. Paris was also irritated that the meeting was held at the US mission rather than at UN headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attending the May 28 session were at least seven countries, including the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, Norway, Belgium, France and Britain, according to a UN source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some African countries are willing to participate in a Burundi operation, but if an emergency mission is organized, the main element would be Western countries, diplomats here said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is prepared to offer logistical support but no troops, the sources said. No Western power was willing to head the mission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Democracy campaigners in Nigeria have strongly condemned a reported endorsement by a United Nations fact-finding mission of military ruler General Sani Abacha's three-year plan to return the country to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Campaign for Democracy (CD) - a coalition of human rights groups - was reacting on May 28 to a story filed at the weekend by the New York correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), which quoted a report of a recent UN team to Nigeria as saying that the three-year transition programme was genuine and that no attempt should be made to interrupt or reverse it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mission, according to the NAN, also warned against imposition of sanctions on Nigeria because such a step could &quot;hurt only ordinary people&quot; and have a negative impact on Nigerian society and the whole of West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a statement, the contents of which were made known here on May 28, the CD said that the report of the UN team, if it truly endorsed the three-year transition programme, &quot;only reinforces our conviction of its duplicity (...) its compromise.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We believe that the mission, which last April 13 ended its two-week assignment to Nigeria, was &quot;pre-meditated and pre-arranged,&quot; the CD said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the statement, the UN report &quot;believes the global clamour for democratic recovery in Nigeria&quot; and has also &quot;betrayed a genuine appreciation of the issues at stake in Nigeria's political crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report of the UN four-man team, a copy of which was presented recently to General Abacha in Abuja by a special envoy of the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Bourtos-Ghali, is yet to be made public in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During its two-week stay in Nigeria, the UN team investigated the execution last November 10 of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight of his Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) companions, the human rights situation in Nigeria and the regime's plan to return the nation to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation held talks with General Abacha, detained Chief Moshood Abiola, top government officials, prosecution and defence lawyers in the trial of Ken Saro-Wiwa and visited oil-rich Ogoniland, the community where the executed activists originated, and also held talks with many pro-democracy, human rights and professional groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before leaving the country, the leader of the delegation, Koffi Atsu Amega, a Togolese, described the human rights situation in Nigeria as &quot;terrible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sudden about-turn was the more surprising to human rights activists here particularly when it comes only a few days after the Nigerian government had announced plans to undertake a series of democratic reforms, notably proposing to exclude military personnel from special courts in which civil disobedience cases are heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures, contained in a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali from Auwalu Hamisu Yadudu, legal advisor to Nigeria ruler General Sani Abacha, and made public at the UN on May 24, addressed in particular the Ogoni tribe, and were taken following a report from a UN fact-finding mission in Nigeria, a spokesman from the world body said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document said the Civil Disturbance Act that led to the conviction-- and eventual hanging -- of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others &quot;will be amended&quot; to prohibit military personnel on the tribunal and to allow for the appeals of verdicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also said the government will investigate whether there are &quot;peculiar ecological and environmental problems in the Ogoni area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa, an Ogoni activist, had accused oil giant Shell of ravaging parts of the Niger delta by reckless drilling for oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the letter from Yadudu said Abacha had also ordered the &quot;immediate review of the cases of all persons currently being detained without trial&quot; under a 1984 decree and that &quot;very shortly, such persons will be released based on an assessment of the individual merit of each case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter also said the 1984 statute, known as Decree No.2, which allows people suspected of &quot;acts prejudicial to state security&quot; to be detained without trial, will be changed to allow for a review every three months of those cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the government said it will repeal the 1994 Decree No.14, which suspends courts' ability to issue writs of Habeas Corpus, generally a step in the court appeals process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed repeal of the laws was seen by human rights groups and lawyers as amounting to an admission by the government of guilt in the case and called on the authorities to translate it into practice by removing decrees that remove power of courts from entertaining certain cases in which the government had interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - It has been established that an official of the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus (EECMY), earlier on reported to have been kidnapped by unidentified persons here is being held by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A EECMY official, who spoke to APS on condition that his name would not be disclosed, said Haily Terfassa Tasse, who is the administrator of one of the church's hostels in the Ethiopian capital &quot;is being held at the Central Police Station, here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church official said Tasse, went missing on April 17, when he was reportedly kidnapped by unidentified persons, while driving to one of the commercial banks in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The April 23 edition of Urgent Action, an update bulletin of cases brought to the attention of the London-based human rights organisation, Amnesty International, reported the disappearance of Hailu Terfassa Tasse, 52.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;His whereabouts remained obscure for a couple of weeks. However, now he can be visited by his wife,&quot; the church official told APS in a telephone interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the major reasons for Tasse's detention would be suspicion that he is having links with the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), which is fighting the government for self-determination in the south of this Horn of Africa country with a population of over 50 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church official further told APS he has already visited Tasse at the police station and also confirmed that the suspect's wife also paid her husband a visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I spoke to him and he told me he was being held at the police station since April 17 and that he has not been 'treated badly'. Asked what he (Tasse) was likely to be charged with, the church official was non-committal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He however disclosed that the church was trying to get their employee released on bail, but by the time of going to press these efforts had not been successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether kidnapping of church personnel was common, the church official said; &quot;Tasse's was the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first in the EECMY since the overthrow of Mengistu Haile Mariam's Derg government. However he cited cases of employees of the church who have been detained but released later on related issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hope Mr. Tasse will be released soon&quot;, the anonymous official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its URGENT/ACTION update dated April 23, 1996 citing dissappearance and fear of torture Amnesty International expresses fear that &quot;his (Tasse's)family have been unable to trace him in police stations but his car was reportedly later found at the Central Police Station.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Amnesty International fears that he may be held in a secret detention centre and could be at risk of ill-treatment or torture,&quot; says the human rights report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report describes Mr. Tasse as a prominent Oromo elder, adding that &quot;many members of the Oromo nationality (or ethnic group) have been detained without charge or trial since February 1996 on suspicion of having links with the OLF, which is fighting the government in the Oromo region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia's population comprises 45 per cent Muslims, 40 per cent Orthodox Christians while the remaining 15 per cent is shared among Protestants, Evangelicals, Roman Catholics and other faith. The EECMY which is Lutheran, was instituted in Ethiopia in 1958. It has a membership of some 1.6 million Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EECMY became a member of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) in 1963 and is affiliated to both the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia is ranked second after Tanzania in the category of African countries with the highest number of Lutherans. Tanzania has an estimated 2.2 million Lutherans, Ethiopia 1.6 million, Madagascar 1.5 million, South Africa 829,000, while Namibia has some 700,000 Lutherans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some 7 million Lutherans in Africa out of a total world population of 54 million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Limuru, Kenya - A church consultation here has reminded African churches of their onus to challenge laws that perpetuate unequal distribution of wealth among the African people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The May 21 o 24 meeting here, some 30 kilometres west of Nairobi, also called for research and implemention of new economic methods that would encourage income generation towards self-reliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 18 para-church organisations in Kenya and local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), also highlighted the need for churches to teach and promote a biblical work ethic for all in the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 85 participants were mainly drawn from Kenya but Botswana, Nigeria, Tanzania and the United States were also represented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On spiritual concerns, the participants said; &quot;we should feel obliged to repent as individuals, local churches and groups, of our lack of faith in God, to supply for the needs in the work He has called us to perform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should also feel obliged to repent of the failure to faithfully administer the resources entrusted to us and the failure to be accountable to God, to His people and to each other,&quot; they further recommended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also emphasized the churches' need to seek divine intervention to enhance a spirit of renewal in doing God's work in Africa with resources from the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The participants added; &quot;We should also make efforts to return to a clear and consistent teaching of scriptures on giving and self- reliance, in our personal lives and churches too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on leadership, the consultation participants called on churches in Africa to ensure that future partnerships between them and donor partners are characterised by mutual respect, trust, full participation, clear understanding, equal contribution and distribution of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The church in Africa should recognise and utilize human resources and other skills whenever possible in the local churches and organisations, the participants further stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also stressed the need for churches to be exemplary role models encouraging simpler life-styles and honouring the Creator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consultation on self-reliance, was organised by the local churches in Kenya and coordinated by Mr. McMillan Kiiru, a consultant with a Nairobi-based NGO, Lenmac, and a former General Secretary of the Fellowship of Christian Communicators in Africa and Madagascar (FOCCAM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his introductory remarks, Mr. Kiiru said although the church seems to be struggling in the search for resources to fulfill the Great Commission, it is &quot;my conviction that there are adequate God-giving resources, which need to be mobilised and developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But this, would require a change of attitude and practice as well as making efforts to reduce our vulnerabilities and increase our capacities, not least our faith in God,&quot; Kiiru said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also stressed the need to develop a greater sense of ownership and commitment to the Church by Africans themselves and more so through financial support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial support from the West, he stressed, has been coupled with foreign leadership and influence with programmes, which, he added, have not been culturally appropriate, reveal paternalistic attitudes, mismanagement of available resources, lack of accountability, fightings and quarrels within the church, a spirit of competition and duplication of efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Kiiru, mission policies, regulations, historical practices and philosophies have often</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> contributed to and even encouraged a dependency syndrome by the African church. &quot;Western funding has in the past been used for theological education, missionary outreach, development projects, pastors salaries and even buildings for Christian worship, Mr. Kiiru further told the consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that the Church in Africa has struggled with limited success to create a more indigenous Christian movement by raising support for her ministries locally. &quot;This can partly be blamed on poverty which characterises the continent as well as a mentality that Africans are too poor to give to their own church,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting was addressed by among others the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) General Secretary, Rev. Jose Chipenda, the former General Secretary of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA), Rev. John Gatu, the current chairman of the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), Rev. Zablon Nthamburi, who is also the Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church here and Dr. G. Ikiara of the University of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - An estimated 20,000 Christians on May 25 converged at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) grounds here, for interdenominational prayers for the government, families and the country's youth after a five-kilometre walk, &quot;March for Jesus&quot;, marked by 15 million Christians in 180 nations worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christians who had marched into the city from five directions singing God's praises, prayed that justice would prevail in Kenya's parliament and judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering the day's sermon, Bishop Muyu of Gospel Tabernacle said that trouble is brought by disobedience. &quot;There are some serious consequences to every disobedience,&quot; he said. Like Jonah in the Bible, one must be quick to understand the cause in order to deal with the problem. &quot;The answer for Kenya is not to flee from the presence of God,&quot; he advised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a session of thanksgiving, confessions and supplications were made on behalf of Kenyan youth for deliverance from alcoholism, drugs and premarital sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congregation also prayed for the government and the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relating to the gathering what had ensued from the previous &quot;March for Jesus&quot; held in 1994, the steering committee chairman Rev. Ibrahim Omondi of Dove Fellowship recalled that the shilling which had been experiencing &quot;high fever&quot; at the time was &quot;healed&quot; and concerning the infamous 1992 to 1994 land clashes, we today celebrate the end of tribal land clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of devil worshippers, another prayer concern, Rev. Omondi said they were now in the country &quot;illegally&quot;, after the institution of a probe committee by the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya, with a population of 25.7 million people experienced an inflation rate as high as 110 per cent in 1992 and a negative growth rate from 1992 to 1994, after which a three per cent growth rate was recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exchange rate of the US dollar to the shilling in 1994 stood at 1$ to between shs 60 and 70. Today the dollar has stabilized at about shs. 58.  The land clashes too, started in 1992 and ended in 1994, while the probe committee comprising spiritual leaders, educationists, social workers and lawyers was instituted January 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interdenominational march, entirely funded by the Kenyan churches, was the result of joint efforts by church leaders mainly of evangelical, pentecostal and mainline church background, although other churches and the general public were invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christians comprise 70 per cent of the population, with Roman Catholics accounting for 18 per cent while the rest are Protestants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A &quot;March for Jesus&quot; event comprises a praise march and a prayer assembly. Among its purposes is to publicly affirm and declare love for Jesus, to share His love, to repent and publicly humble, to praise the person of Jesus Christ and not to parade personalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was Nairobi's second &quot;March for Jesus&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanza, Tanzania - Divers from Kenya, South Africa and Tanzania are hampered by extreme dark conditions as they try to free hundreds of bodies still trapped in the compartment of the ill fated Lake Victoria ferry, MV Bukoba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 400 bodies have been recovered from Lake Victoria since the unprecedented marine tragedy occurred on May 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lt. Commander Ahmed Hamisi of the Zanzibar Navy said working conditions 100ft under water are dreadful. The divers had succeeded in cutting an access through the hull but lack of underwater lighting and the fact that the bodies had swelled and become more tightly packed had made their work &quot;very difficult.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of people are still camped by the lakeside in the port town of Mwanza awaiting to identify their loved ones for private burial, but many late recovered bodies are beyond identification except for peculiar features or clothing. The final death toll is expected to reach 1000, twice the carrying capacity of the ferry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ship which had chronic balance problems flipped over side ways at about daybreak while nearing Mwanza after an overnight trip from Bukoba on the western shores of Lake Victoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During an ecumenical prayer service for the dead at Mwanza stadium President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania said an inquiry would be instituted and those responsible punished.&quot; Most of the recovered bodies were interred at Igara near Mwanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rukiya Shamte of the Tanzanian Railways Corporation has meanwhile announced the suspension of Captain Jumane Rume in charge of the ill fated vessel as well as six officials of the Marine Department of Tanzania Railway who are in charge of the MV Bukoba. She said it was a routine safety enquiry after any accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of extremely disturbing facts have emerged about the MV Bukoba.  First, Tanzania Railway officials said it was not insured. Secondly, the Belgian company that had supplied the ferry had already gone under. The ferry design was known to have stability problems but it was probably assumed that Lake Victoria was inherently safer than other seas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, rescuers who cut the hull a few hours after the vessel capsized - but still remained afloat - ignored the pleas of local fishermen who told them the craft would sink once the trapped air escaped. Hundreds of people still trapped in the lower compartment at the time were still alive and banged frantically from inside. They perished 15 minutes after the hull was cut by the rescuers. The MV Bukoba now lies 100 ft under water.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Celebrations marking the second anniversary of the Kenya-based Sudanese Women's Association in Nairobi (SWAN) on April 27, were a milestone in the progress of Sudanese women who fled to neighbouring Kenya following civil war at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The event which coincided with the association's annual general meeting, was also attended by members residing in Lake Victoria's port town of Kisumu in Western Kenya, some 340 kilometres north-west of Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SWAN, comprising southern Sudanese women exiles in Kenya, was registered in 1994. A non-charitable organisation, it encourages its members to work for a living, espousing commitment to a workable peace process in the Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to APS, Mrs. Carla Tongun, the vice chairperson of the association, stated that despite the differences at home particularly as Southerners engage in factional fighting, the SWAN members, who are wives of those fighting, have worked together peacefully. This alone is a step towards peace and reconciliation among the Sudanese people, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The peace process cannot succeed unless the common people come together as they are the ones suffering and affected by the war particularly women, children and other vulnerable persons. Peace should be approached at the grass roots level and our leaders should be told to follow, not ask to be followed,&quot; Mrs. Tongun asserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SWAN anniversary celebrations were also attended by other women groups, among them the Sudanese Women's Voice for Peace (SWVP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Formed in February 1994, SWVP carries out peace related activities at the grass roots level while SWAN tackles social development programmes. The former also advocates peace initiatives and networking with regional and international peace movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of SWAN mainly face health and nutritional problems, and are generally poor, with war and poverty, related illness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The association's main objective is to encourage channels of communication, consultation and interaction among and between diverse groups of Sudanese women who are living in Nairobi and Kisumu. It also identifies and prioritizes economic, social and educational needs of members, with the view of acquiring skills and knowledge to enable them become self-sufficient.  Such efforts can help the group seek sisterly affiliation with other women groups in Kenya such as the Women Finance Trust (KWFT) which works with rural women groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A focal point for Sudanese activities in Nairobi, SWAN also coordinates educational programmes. About 37 women and two men recently underwent a six-month basic English language course in Nairobi conducted by teachers who are mainly from among the Sudanese women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ability to read, write and speak basic English is crucial for these women as this skill will help them join such courses as tailoring. Already, 36 of them are beneficiaries of tailoring courses. Out of this lot, 12 have already graduated and are putting the acquired skills to good use in their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the kindergarten project, 125 members have received partial scholarships for kindergarten-aged children. Without this basic education, Sudanese children cannot enter good primary schools in Kenya generally and Nairobi in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 40 per cent of SWAN members cannot communicate in English and Kiswahili, Kenya's official and national language respectively. For a regular meeting of SWAN, discussions have to be translated into between five and eight languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1995 some 81 women have benefitted from SWAN's English language courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But funding has been erratic. Sponsors do not always honour their pledges on time, which makes implementation of projects very difficult. From 1994 to 1995, SWAN's income totalled Kshs.4,158,688.00 (US$71,700) while expenditure stood at Kshs.3,602,615.00 (US$62,114). The United Nations Fund for Women (UNIFEM) is the major donor through the UN Women in Crisis programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding overall development, the SWAN vice chairperson urges women to work hand in hand with men for progress. &quot;A woman is a source of stability in the family and in the society as well,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through SWAN, Sudanese women living in this East African country have also attended regional and international seminars like the UN Women's Conference in Beijing, China last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have also taken part in workshops on HIV awareness, nutrition, Christian growth and leadership courses, mostly sponsored by the UN Women in Crisis, Caritas Netherlands, and International Refugee trust (IRT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As SWAN prepares women to realize their role in future leadership in the Sudan, Mrs. Tongun is very optimistic that when peace comes to the country, the association members, most of whom are involved in various self-sustaining activities, will be the resource people for rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says one of the trainees Mrs. Yolanda Ilorya; &quot;The English ,language training which I have acquired was good , but the six months was too short. I wish it could be extended.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, she was full of praise for the association. &quot;SWAN is doing nice work for the Sudanese women in Nairobi, but they have financial constraints. If these women could get more help, they can support many Sudanese women who are suffering in Nairobi city with their children through education, feeding, health services and accommodation. Now they have trained many women in tailoring, taught them hygiene and granted loans despite the financial difficulties they encounter,&quot; she told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan has been involved in civil war for the past four decades, resulting in dramatic displacement of the population. The war, including inter-factional fighting has further exacerbated the people's suffering caused by recurring droughts and floods. The current civil war involving the Khartoum government and the liberation groups in the south began in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of refugees have fled to neighbouring countries of Central African Republic, Kenya, Zaire, Uganda and Ethiopia. While thousands more have sought political asylum in other countries worldwide, millions more have been internally displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis has left miserable images of destroyed property, family separations, mental and physical disabilities, and the overall destruction of the social, cultural and economic fabric that held society together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women have often watched helplessly as the different warring parties ravaged their homes, forcing them into camps within Sudan or into exile in neighbouring countries, trailing with them the young, elderly, and the disabled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Final Exit Society (FES)-Zimbabwe, a pressure group advocating for a new law which will allow voluntary euthanasia for people afflicted with terminal illnesses or those with incurable diseases such as cancer or AIDS, is convinced human beings have a right to chose to die with dignity or what is generally referred to as &quot;mercy killing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a host of other people - especially the Church sees the issue of &quot;mercy killing&quot; differently. Reacting to a report published in a local newspaper, the Sunday Mail, in early May, Father Oscar Wermter, SJ, the Social Communications Secretary of the Zimbabwe Bishops' Conference lashed out at the report entitled Everyone has a right to die with dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He contended; &quot;Certainly! (to dying with dignity). But no one has the right to kill. Not even a terminally ill person. Doctors and nurses are ethically obliged to preserve life. They must never be allowed to be dispensers of death...&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, the euthanasia campaigners insist that the medical fraternity, by prolonging the life of terminally ill people, whether with the aid of life-supporting machines, such as oxygen tanks, catheters, etc, are, in their view being &quot;cruel&quot; as such people - who will still die anyway, must be allowed to make their own decisions concerning their own lives and be left to die with dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, an association for the welfare of prisoners and ex- convicts, the Zimbabwe Association of Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation of the Offender (ZACRO), at about the same time appealed to the government to stop wasting scarce resources by keeping terminally ill prisoners in jail, especially those showing symptoms of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The state should release all prisoners in this category, says ZACRO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZACRO secretary general, Sam Muyamba who led a tour of Zimbabwe's largest prisons in March 1996 with his organisation's national executive, said estimates given to them by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare indicated that at least one out of every ten prisoners suffered from HIV or AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are around 22,000 prisoners in the country's jails - far exceeding the carrying capacity of 16,000, while the cost of feeding one prisoner is said to be almost Zimbabwe dollars 700 (about US$70) every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Given such estimates, it therefore becomes clear that many prisoners are suffering from HIV or AIDS. So by releasing such prisoners, Government would save thousands of dollars in the process,&quot; said Mr Muyamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Wermter made a passionate appeal to all mankind and to Zimbabweans in particular to do everything possible to care for their dying fellowmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We all have the duty to care for the dying and stand by them until their last breath. Enormous progress has been made in alleviating pain and severe stress of incurably ill patients. Just ask the dedicated workers of Island Hospice Service, (a special home for the terminally ill which was set up by churches in Harare several years ago). The churches make strenuous efforts to teach people home-based nursing care of their relatives with AIDS.  We do not need to speed up dying. We need to give more care, and more resources to the living, including those whose life is coming to its natural end,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Catholic Church insists on the inviolability and dignity of the human person from the moment of conception until the natural death,&quot; (Pope John Paul II, speaking in the Catholic Cathedral, in Harare on September 11, 1988). Our technological culture wants to manage and engineer everything, even life and death. But we have to observe limits: our human dignity is only respected if we accept life and death from the hand of our Maker,&quot; explained Wermter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On social responsibility as Africans, Fr. Wermter noted; &quot;One of the best traits of African culture is the great concern shown for the ill and respect for the elderly. Are we now putting pressure on the terminally ill to end the burden that prolongation of life will impose on others? Are we caving in under the impact of AIDS? Is AIDS brutalizing us?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no moral obligation to artificially prolong a life which is clearly coming to its natural end by using extraordinary means. But the Church will always resist giving &quot;medical authorities statutory powers to end the life of a terminally ill patient, i.e. active euthanasia,&quot; concluded the Communications Secretary of the Bishops' Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet those who support euthanasia say among other things, that they desperately need a law which adequately caters for those willing and voluntarily prepared to take their own lives either due to boredom, unbearable mental suffering or other circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The campaigners urge the government to set up an euthanasia committee comprising some Members of Parliament, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, human rights groups and members of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP). This committee would give sufficient legal protection to doctors, thus preventing them from being accused of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before one wishes to end his/her live, a doctor has to consult the euthanasia committee for counselling and verification of the person's viewpoint to determine if it is voluntary death. The doctor will then go ahead and a person is quickly rested, the pro-euthanasia lobbyists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Voluntary euthanasia is a new concept in Zimbabwe which, if recognised, will give the medical authorities statutory powers to end the life of a terminally ill patient, as is the case in such countries as the Netherlands,&quot; claims a founder member of the controversial organisation, Jeanette Lamb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FES-Zimbabwe, now a member of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies, was set up following the visit to Zimbabwe early in 1996 by the secretary general of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of London, John Oliver, who addressed several organisations on the sensitive and controversial subject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But should terminally ill people have the right to die peacefully without prolonged suffering through assisted suicides?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Voluntary Euthanasia Society believes that this (decision) should be the lawful right of individuals in carefully defined circumstances and with utmost safeguards, if and only that is their expressed and sustained wish,&quot; says Lamb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She says with voluntary euthanasia, terminally ill patients in Zimbabwe would be allowed to indicate their wishes in advance about life prolonging medical treatment should they become incurably ill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unlike Christians and others who say God alone can give and take life, we think that there are circumstances in which concern for the quality of a person's natural life should override the desire to preserve it at all costs,&quot; says Lamb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Lamb, humanists consider euthanasia (voluntary) a moral right when the sufferer's life is hopeless. But, she stresses, there must be no prospect of relief before death and the sufferer must have made it clear that he or she would rather die with dignity at a time of their own choice than continue to live in suffering or with loss of dignity, or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Humanists consider there should be no reasonable prospect for recovery or cure and the judgement as to whether the condition is intolerable must always be made by the sufferer, either at the same time or beforehand,&quot; says Lamb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among examples she cites where a sufferer might consider life to be hopeless are serious physical suffering, loss of personal dignity, loss of the power of understanding either completely, as in a coma, or partially and progressively, as in dementia, and the loss of power to act so that the sufferer becomes unable to do things that have given meaning to his/her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lamb argues, although it is right for society to define conditions and establish protection, it is not up to others to overrule a person's wish to die. &quot;Where life is hopeless, to refuse immediate release from suffering is merely to postpone the inevitable with no intervening benefit,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The purpose, may be to end the pain and distress, either mental or physical, which the sufferer is experiencing or the wish may be unselfish, to end the burden that prolongation of life will impose on others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In either case it is inhumane and lacking in respect for society to deprive an individual of the right to choose a painless and honourable way out of the situation,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She describes as &quot;unreal&quot; the fear that unscrupulous families will use the pretext of &quot;voluntary&quot; euthanasia to hasten the deaths of elderly relatives for their own gain and against the old person's will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lamb believes that doctors and medical staff should not be asked to act in any way they consider morally wrong but should equally not infringe on the rights of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a researcher, J.A. Gordon of Harare opts for rational analgesia as the solution to the question of euthanasia and says that in his opinion the answer to any form of euthanasia is definitely &quot;No! No! No!&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Gordon, mercy killing is neither legal in Britain nor Holland. However, in Holland it has been tolerated under certain circumstances which in fact, cover both voluntary and non-voluntary euthanasia and allows for euthanasia under certain conditions which lead to abuse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - As sub-Saharan Africa's gold mining countries open up by the day to foreign mining companies in response to liberalization demands from international money lending houses, they run the risk of squandering away this much valued natural resource instead of benefiting from it as do other gold mining countries in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In search of sub-Sahara Africa's gold today are said to be transnational corporations &quot;and an aggressive new breed of junior mining companies which are now jostling in a headlong rush to stake their claims,&quot; reports the May 1996 edition of the London-based PANOS Media Briefing publication entitled, The Lure of Gold; How Golden is the Future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PANOS reports that these companies are being made welcome as never before. Of the 70 countries in the so called Third World which have changed their mining laws to attract foreign companies, 31 are entirely in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such countries as Ghana, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mali, Eritrea and Namibia are said to be &quot;holding out a raft of incentives, from the lifting of foreign ownership restrictions to reduce taxes and the boosting of profit repatriation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report adds that some sub-Saharan countries are tripping over each other in courting foreign companies for their bids for gold mining as the sale of state assets gains momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such entitlement as &quot;allowing tax-free imports, differing royalties and similar payments, and permitting the expatriation of up to 100 per cent of the profits and even the export of all the gold mine,&quot; are being used to lure gold mining companies into impoverished Third World countries, more so in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lure of Gold warns that the costs and benefits may be a tricky task for poor countries striving for sustainable development. &quot;Without new safeguards,&quot; cautions the publication, &quot;the lustre of gold may well turn out to be as illusory for developing countries as the fabled El Dorado.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Global demand for gold today is said to be higher than ever before. This has boosted prices and profits. The demand, for example, rose from a record 3,573 tonnes in 1992 to 3,642 in 1995. Most of it ends up in the so called East Asian Tigers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PANOS, quoting the Commodity Research Bureau, says the African continent has 31 per cent of the world's known resources of gold. On the other hand, exploration targets suggest that in 20 years' time, about half of global gold production will derive from indigenous peoples' territories mainly in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, according to observers, poses a number of questions. For example who will benefit financially from the gold mining process in the region?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the one side of the mining game in sub-Saharan Africa are giant conglomerates which are fast staking their claims on African minefields.  These are mainly Australian, British and North American companies. They include BHP Minerals -- Australia's biggest conglomerate, CLUFF of Britain, London-based Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ), and Anglo American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That some of these giant companies have been allowed by legislation in some cases, to repatriate as much as 100 per cent of the profits they make from African goldmines and even export all the gold mined, poses grave danger to impoverished sub-Saharan African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These worries are not only based on the fact that sub-Saharan African countries will be looted of this precious resource through such uneven arrangements but also that indigenous populations, on whose land most of the gold struts, will end up being evacuated to less promising land and at their best only benefiting marginally as cheaply paid labourers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However some countries in the region seem to have already visualized this looming danger and are putting legislative checks into place. Says Pepukai Gwata, the First Commercial Secretary at the Zimbabwe High Commission in Nairobi, &quot;all the gold mined in the country is by law sold to the Central Bank which refines it, keeps some in the national reserves, sells some to internal users, mainly for jewellery, and exports the rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe is more of an exception in Africa rather than the norm. Other than the fear of large corporations which are said to be merging &quot;as they seek to exploit the Third World better,&quot; there is also mounting suspicion of a growing number of &quot;junior groups of companies&quot; also referred to as &quot;wildcats,&quot; who are increasingly putting their claims on sub-Saharan goldmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These &quot;wildcats&quot; are said to be arousing fear and suspicion as they encroach on traditional small scale mining grounds. The Lure Of Gold estimates that in Africa, small scale miners produce up to 20 per cent of the continent's gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the sub-Saharan region, more than 1.5 million people work in the informal mining sector, while in Zimbabwe the figure is put at 100,000,&quot; the publication reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tanzania, the Central African Republic and Sierra Leone, the total gold output today is said to come from small scale miners. The PANOS publication estimates that in 20 years time, half of the global gold production will derive from indigenous peoples' territories. Most of it by then will no longer be owned by indigenous peoples, thanks to the incessant penetration of &quot;wildcats&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Canadian government working group is said to have identified some 200 Canadian &quot;wildcats&quot; operating outside their home country by 1992. By 1995, that figure had trebled and virtually all were exploiting mines in the Third World. Such companies are said to be mobile, relatively inconspicuous and hence enter indigenous territories much more easily. Presently, they are said to be opening up new fields of exploitation in such sub-Saharan countries as Ethiopia and Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And with the regional governments' policy shifting inexorably away from state controlled mining to liberalization and hence foreign mining, many gold fields currently mined by millions of small scale miners in Tanzania, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia and Namibia, for example, will inevitably be licensed to foreign concerns, probably &quot;wildcats&quot; who eventually hand over their operations at sumptuous profits to giant conglomerates. &quot;In this way,&quot; says the PANOS publication, &quot;the big corporations still continue to hold their sway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As this emerging process of &quot;resource grabbing&quot; takes root in the region, one might want to know what the indigenous peoples' stake is, both in owning the resources and the profits to be made off them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zimbabwe, &quot;if you discover gold or any other minerals on your land you surrender it to the state. You can only continue owning that piece of land if you have prospecting rights,&quot; Gwata told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other than fears for indigenous peoples' rights over their lands, natural resources and the proceeds thereof, observers are also concerned about environmental degradation and related health hazards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), &quot;mining is one of the world's most hazardous sectors causing more than 15,000 deaths annually.&quot; South African miners feature at the top of this casualty list.  These deaths are poised to increase in sub-Saharan Africa owing to increased mining activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore gold mining is said to have potentially heavy environmental costs as it usually involves the use of cyanide and mercury in the casting process. Both are very toxic substances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cyanide is particularly singled out as having severe environmental impact. It is extremely poisonous to people, wildlife as well as plants.  Hence extensive mining in sub-Saharan Africa is a potential danger to people's health and the entire environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other environmental problems anticipated include widespread excavation of top soil leading to severe loss, and widespread felling of vegetation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bearing these consequences in mind, The Lure Of Gold warns that if the South, more so sub-Saharan Africa, has to benefit &quot;from gold mining, the economic and environmental regards are imperative. This may involve a recognition of mining as a national strategic industry and developing mining policies which ensure that a fair share of the vast profits go towards local communities and sustainable development practices.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Standard Chartered Bank has been accused by its 'small' customers of ditching them for big corporate clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 'small' customers complained that the minimum account balances the bank is demanding are just a way of politely telling them to leave as it steers towards a corporate banking policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had to close my account because I could not afford the new balances,&quot; carped Mulenga Musonda of Lusaka in a walk-in interview yesterday. &quot;I cannot understand why a bank which has previously been very people-inclined should do this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Paul Tembo, a small-scale businessman, who claimed his account had been closed by the bank, said the bank was trying to change its clientele to cater for only a small elite group like the way Citibank and Stanbic are doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But they are definitely going the wrong way around and just upsetting everybody in the process,&quot; Tembo charged in a walk in interview in Lusaka yesterday. &quot;Now that the market is liberalised, we can always go elsewhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to get comments from the bank yesterday proved fruitless.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Democracy must be synonymous with equal representation for women, demanded Chief Justice Matthew Ngulube yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking during the official opening of the training of women candidates for local government and general elections two day workshop in Lusaka, justice Ngulube charged that democracy must be made to respond to womens' concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we think back to the days before 1964, men fought side by side with the women. So where are the women in power now?&quot; asked Ngulube, adding: &quot;Whereas men have made headway, women have lagged behind and no nation, let alone a democratic one, can afford to leave behind more than half of its population and expect meaningful development to be attained.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chief Justice noted that women comprise less that 10 per cent of the members of parliament and legislators around the globe and yet the constitute the majority of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Democracy need not be perceived simply as an ideology, rather it should be viewed as a practical tool to embrace women and what they stand for,&quot; justice Ngulube advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Ngulube, however, said that women themselves were hesitant to run for office and urged them to change the equations, remove the long standing barriers and open the windows of opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Ngulube advised women to develop their own vision of their future saying &quot;the government would not rescue them&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Gains will only be attained through sustained struggle that is, the women's struggle,&quot; justice Ngulube advised. &quot;Working in coalition, women's NGOs should consolidate the women's stand and effectively contribute in the task of eradicating poverty, increasing human rights awareness, reducing violence, peace making and education.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chief Justice also observed that there was a general lack of support for women in politics from men who feel threatened or believe that wives should stay in the home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The importance of political training for prospective and potential candidates is self-evident,&quot; Justice Ngulube observed, adding: &quot; Civic education and consciousness raising activities would help all citizens to recognise that women must be equally engaged in governing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Bank of Zambia's high denominated notes are in the country and ready for distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing the arrival of the notes at a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday, Bank of Zambia deputy governor Situmbeko Musokotwane however admitted CAMDEX, a company owed money by the central bank, had blocked their shipment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although CAMDEX did have an injunction to stop the shipping of the notes to Zambia, the efforts by the Bank's (BOZ) solicitors in the United Kingdom's appeal court to remove the injunction were successful,&quot; Musokotwane disclosed. &quot;The bank notes are therefore freed of any encumberances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Musokotwane, however, assured the security of the notes had not been compromised by the injunction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even during the time when there was an injunction on them, the new notes never left the premises of Thomas De La Rue, the company that printed them,&quot; Musokotwane said. &quot;The security of these notes has therefore not been compromised in any way at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And speaking at the same press briefing, Bank of Zambia secretary, Chilufya Mbalashi, revealed that CAMDEX International was owed 86 million and the debt dates back to 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAMDEX International bought off the debt, which Bank of Zambia had failed to service, from the central bank of Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbalashi also disclosed that the CAMDEX injunction was dropped after CAMDEX and the court found that the notes were valueless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about what the CAMDEX loan meant for, Musokotwane said it might have been for &quot;the boosting of foreign exchange reserves&quot; whose supplies were rather erratic during that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And without stating who else the bank owed money, Musokotwane disclosed that the country was still &quot;highly indebted&quot; and had no capacity to pay all its creditors in full.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Indeni Oil Refinery is struggling with a technical fault which has existed since March this year causing the plant to produce impure premium petrol and less kerosene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source from Indeni's Ndola plant confirmed yesterday that the plant had been struggling to repair the technical fault which has affected the purifying process since March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a highly placed representative from the oil industry confirmed that Zambia has been receiving her crude oil shipments on schedule, contradicting rumours that the country had been failing to pay for oil supplies and suppliers had decided to halt oil shipments, leading to the fuel shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No such thing has happened though there has been a problem in the refining process which I expect to be rectified by today,&quot; he said, insisting: &quot;The engineers have finally dealt with the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, energy minister Edith Nawakwi announced that the fault would be quickly attended to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But though the refinery had set the re-opening date as May 28, operations failed &quot;due to lack of hydrogen&quot;, Indeni explained in a statement yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) deputy general secretary, Azwell Banda, claimed in an interview yesterday that President Chiluba has not established his origins beyond any reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chiluba has not conclusively established his origins,&quot; Banda claimed yesterday. &quot;It is strange that a person who knows that his background is unclear should sign such a constitution.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda said it was a natural consequence of &quot;their own insanity&quot; if President Chiluba doesn't qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If there are any political parties investigating Chiluba I think it is perfectly in order because the amended constitution supports them,&quot; Banda said. &quot;We have always warned that such amendments may lead to ethnic cleansing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda insisted there was totally nothing wrong with investigating President Chiluba's origins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After all that is what Chiluba has been doing to leading member of the opposition,&quot; Banda said. &quot;Chiluba will have to establish beyond any reasonable doubt that he is Zambian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And National Salvation Party president David Kasuba, in a statement released in Lusaka yesterday, said President Chiluba had passed a constitution which would set back Zambian progress because of its divisive nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Congress of Trade Unions chairman, Fackson Shamenda, said yesterday the government should not try to force Zambian to accept its constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is unfortunate that the government has decided to ignore the calls of the people for a consensus,&quot; said Shamenda in a telephone interview from Ndola yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And special assistant to UNIP president, former president Kenneth Kaunda, Muhabi Lungu said his party would fight the amended constitution legally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will use the courts to fight this constitution,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of Information and Broadcasting Amusaa Mwanamwambwa refused to make any comment on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Frankly, I have no further comment to make on a subject which has long been debated, especially to allegations made by people who have no conclusive evidence,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda said it was only logical that the citizens of Zambia would wish to establish the roots of the current President seeing that the constitution now demands it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are satisfied at ZDC that when the interests of the nation collide with the interests of one man, then the interests of the nation must prevail,&quot; Banda said. &quot;They have sown the wind, and they will reap the storm.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The yet to be launched Radio Christian Voice became the first radio station in Zambia to pay royalties to the writers of music played on their station when they presented the Zambian Copyrights Society (ZAMCOPS) with a K5.84 million cheque on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presenting the cheque to ZAMCOPS chairman Jagari Chanda, the station's manager, Philip Haggar, said the money would also help to fight copyright piracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are delighted to be able to take the lead in presenting this cheque to ZAMCOPS,&quot; Haggar said. &quot;We have been waiting for the formation of a collection and distribution society, to support Zambian musicians, and we are pleased to see it being started in such a professional and enthusiastic way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haggar added that his station supports the efforts of ZAMCOPS and urged other radio stations to recognise their obligations to pay the authors of the music which they play on their stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chanda has, meanwhile, taken a swipe at Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) for not recognising the artists whose music they play on radio and television by way of paying royalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have suffered enough because some radio stations like ZNBC are playing our music for free and we shall not allow such a thing to continue any longer,&quot; Chanda warned. &quot;Musicians live on music, therefore, what is due to them should be paid.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The long awaited Zambian tour of Britain's leading professional all-female a cappella group, the Black Voices, is finally on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Black Voices will be visiting Zambia from 13 to 18 June, 1996 under the auspices of the British Council,&quot; announced British Council deputy director, Shoba Ponnappa, in a statement issued in Lusaka last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group, which plays a blend of gospel, calypso, reggae, spiritual and popular contemporary songs, was initially scheduled to tour Zambia some two months ago but due to vagaries which Ponnappa declined to divulge, they could not.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Zambia the group will put up jams at the Lusaka Playhouse on June 13, Ndola's Savoy hotel on June 15 and Lusaka's Intercontinental Hotel on June 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On June 14 and 17, they will be conducting workshops for Zambian musicians at the British Council,&quot; Ponnappa said, adding that the workshops will cover historical information on the development of black music together with practical ways of using different material and harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The aim of the workshop is for Zambian and British musicians to share ideas and music, learning songs and rhythms from each other,&quot; Ponnappa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group, which comprises five female vocalists, was formed in 1988 and has over the years travelled extensively around the world and built up an enviable reputation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outspoken British member of parliament, Bennie Grant, once described the group thus: &quot;Black Voices reminded me that the best musical instrument is the human voice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For British Arts Council music director, Kenneth Baird, &quot;the heartfelt commitment and the rich blend of voices in this acappella group, who present themselves with considerable style make for performances that are both moving and memorable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ponnappa couldn't have put it more succinctly: &quot;Their music speaks to the world and has been described as either infectiously exuberant or quietly moving.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> London - Following the National Islamic Front (NIF) regime's failure to comply with the UN Security Council Resolution 1044, the governments of Egypt and Ethiopia differed sharply last month in New York over the issue of sanctions to be imposed upon the regime in Sudan. It became clear in each country's presentation to the Security Council that the Egyptians were opposed to any sanctions being imposed, whilst the Ethiopians wanted the strongest of measures to be taken. This appeared to reflect the Egyptians' desire to use the sanctions issue as a means for placating the regime in Khartoum and the Ethiopians' desire to deal with the issue as a criminal rather than a political matter. The NIF regime, naturally, issued statements appreciating the Egyptians stance, in sharp contrast to the views of the Sudanese public who saw the Egyptian position as a hypocritical turn around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last 26 June and the days immediately following it, President Mubarak and the Egyptian leadership were visibly shaken by the assassination attempt on the streets of Addis Ababa. Pre-empting any official investigation, the Egyptian government immediately apportioned the blame for the incident on the NIF regime. The Egyptians tried to usurp the official investigations in Ethiopia, believing that the Ethiopians would perhaps not do a thorough job.  This attitude angered and frustrated the Ethiopians but at least did show that the Egyptians wanted to get the heart of the assassination plot.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clear Evidence: When the Ethiopian authorities announced their findings and implicated the NIF regime in the plot, the Egyptians were more than pleased and started to cooperate with the Ethiopians as to what further steps to take. The two countries jointly took their evidence to the UN Security Council and worked together to ensure the unanimous approval of Resolution 1044 on 31 January of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, having secured the resolution, and with the threat of sanctions being imposed, the Egyptians, for reasons best known to themselves, began to manoeuvre with the Khartoum regime. It seems tht the Egyptian authorities wished to gain some kind of hold over the regime by presenting themselves as the people who stopped sanctions being imposed. It is now believed that some kind of deal was being struck concerning the large numbers of Egyptian Islamic Fundamentalists terrorists based in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Egyptians ambassador to the UN, Nabil El Arabi, told the Security Council that the issue of the assassination attempt and the three terrorists accused of conspiring in it was a matter for the Egyptian authorities alone and something that Cairo would competently deal with. As a co-sponsor of the original resolution, this was a bizarre positoin for the Egyptians to take and it only served to increase the suspicions that Cairo and Khartoum had brokered some kind of secret deal. Why did Egypt go the Security Council in the first place if it wanted to deal with the matter on their own terms with Khartoum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Playing the Southern Card: A public statement issued in Cairo by the ministry of foreign affairs at the time that the Security Council was debating the issue, said that the Egyptian government could not accpet any economic or military sanctions being imposed on Sudan. Egypt did not want to be responsible for punishing the Sudanese people. In addition, the statement said that an arms embargo would hand victory in the civil war in Sudan to the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which would lead to the political separation of the South from the North. Egypt would not allow the Southern rebels to defeat Sudan's national army. Furthermore, Egypt would not allow Sudan's national security interests to be violated. It was a characteristically pretentious performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt's colonial and patronising attitude towards Sudan was unlikely to win votes from the Sudanese public as a whole, and did little to endear Cairo to the Khartoum regime either. However, the Egyptians have repeatedly intervened in Sudanese matters, especially when they have concerned events in Southern Sudan. For instance, in the first phase of the Sudanese civil war, 1955-1972, Egyptian military intervention on behalf of Khartoum is very well documented. In 1994, the Egyptians were instrumental in persuading the Arab League of Nations to pass a resolution condemning the call for Self-determination for Southern Sudan. The language of that resolution was implicitly racist as was the notion that an organisation, which by its own definition of an Arab does not represent eighty percent of Sudan's population, could pass judgment on the motivating forces behind the conflict in Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the same year, President Mubarak, as chairperson of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) prevented the SPLA from attending the OAU meetings in Cairo as observers and then failed to mention the Sudanese conflict in any of his major speeches. He reviewed all of Africa's other conflicts, but somehow managed to overlook the problems of Sudan, the one closest to his own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia's Reaction: Undoubtedly shocked by Cairo's volteface at the Security Council, the Ethiopian government insisted that the toughest sanctions be imposed upon Sudan. The Ethiopians said, rightly, that the terrorist crime committed on Ethiopian territory could not be allowed to go unpunished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a clearly worded statement, Addis Ababa said it would be wrong for any one country to imply that it alone cared for the interests of the Sudanese people. Ethiopia was also a close neighbour of Sudan and was also a friend of the Sudanese people. However, the NIG regime was using terrorism against its own people and their friends in neighbouring states, and as such ought to be treated as the criminal in truly is. From their own close contacts with Sudan, the Ethiopians added that the Sudanese people have demanded comprehensive sanctions to be imposed upon a very unpopular NIF regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopians circulated a draft resolution in New York which demanded sanctions such as a complete arms embargo and the barring of Sudan Airways' flights to any member state. The national carrier could not be left out of any call for sanctions because it had clearly been used to fly the terrorist suspects out of Addis Ababa following the assassination attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Resolution: In well known UN style, the Security Council examined the extreme position of the Egyptian government, contrasted it with that of the Ethiopian government, and arrived at what it believed to be a fair compromise. Light sanctions would be imposed upon Khartoum and they would be gradually increased by increments if the regime continued to fail to comply with Resolution 1044.  By their muddle-minded manner of dealing with issues, the Egyptians have just managed to make a laughing stock of the world body.  How can any member of the ordinary public be expected to respect UN Security Council resolutions if it finds a member state guilty by unanimous vote and yet fails to ensure appropriate punishment for the crime? Whatever Egypt may think they have achieved by their behaviour at the UN, they have encouraged Khartoum to continue its criminal ways. And next time, maybe Mr. Mubarak or any other Egyptian leader the NIF is targeting may not be so lucky. Then it will be too late to ask the world community to do something.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the summary and conclusion of a report on Kenya issued by the International Republican Institute:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the surface, Kenya appears to be no closer to achieving the democracy many hoped for when the country repealed its law mandating single-party rule in 1991. Despite the creation of enduring opposition parties and a multiparty election in 1992, there are those who remain pessimistic that the government of President Daniel arap Moi will ever genuinely accept pluralist democracy in this East African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even positive developments, such as the March 1 meeting between President Moi and the leaders of the three main opposition political parties turned out to be less momentous than first hoped. President Moi pledged to take action on the design of the national identity card and other issues aimed at opening up the political environment in advance of the anticipated 1997 general elections. Still, lower level functionaries continued to clamp down on the political opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A joint opposition rally in Meru involving Michael Wamalwa of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy - Kenya (FORD-Kenya), Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party (DP) and Martin Shikuku of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy - Asili (FORD-Asili) was broken up by police wielding clubs and using tear gas. The license for the meeting was suspended by local authorities early on the morning of the rally unbeknownst to the organizers.  Other licensed political meetings also have been disrupted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan government, which had pulled back a repressive political party regulation bill last year in response to local and international pressure, has reintroduced the measure in Parliament. A repressive media bill was pulled back last year ostensibly for reworking, but it is reportedly about to be pushed again in the current parliamentary session. The political environment is still significantly tilted in favor of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU), and restrictive laws that hamper the operation of a multiparty democracy remain on the books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet despite the current circumstances, there is much cause for optimism that Kenya's political problems can be solved in the near future and that steps are being taken even now to lead to such solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic indicators are positive for Kenya, and the government has taken measures to deal with corruption that have led to arrests and suspensions of major government officials and resulted in hundreds of millions in revenue from correctly collected tariffs. Legislative oversight by opposition parliamentarians appears to be successfully guarding against the kind of financial manipulations that helped the ruling party amass a war chest to bribe opposition politicians and voters in the 1992 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition political parties and elements of civil society are attempting to coalesce around commonly accepted changes in the constitution and election procedures before the next general elections. The government and the ruling party also have pledged in two separate Parliamentary motions to cooperate in an examination of the country's political environment.  Meanwhile, a coalition of civic groups and the three main opposition political parties co-sponsored a May conference to discuss constitutional reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the country's political parties are all mired in leadership struggles, democracy in internal party affairs is beginning to be practiced, if somewhat painfully. This promises to lead to a greater commitment to democratic practice generally. The leaders of the three main opposition parties and their top lieutenants began meeting quietly during late summer and fall of 1995 to discuss an alliance that would begin on a parliamentary level and then broaden to include other national pro-democracy forces. In late November, the formation of the National Alliance was announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition party defections, which have caused nearly two dozen by-elections since the 1992 general elections, are becoming more difficult for the ruling party to manage successfully. The advent of issue-oriented politics by all parties threatens to make defection more costly, both in financial and political terms, for all concerned. Moreover, if the opposition Alliance can join in a lasting partnership with civil society, threats by ruling party officials to defect to the opposition might come to pass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women compose the majority of the Kenyan electorate and the overwhelming percentage of actual voters. Civic and voter education conducted since 1992 appears to have had the impact of causing grassroots women and female leaders to take a more active stand for their rights in a variety of situations. More than 30 Kenyan women's organizations have agreed on the goal of electing more women to Parliament and local councils. This should have a profound impact on the next elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newer political leaders now on the scene and those being developed promise to reform Kenyan politics not only over the long term, but perhaps in time to improve the conduct of the anticipated 1997 general elections.  Frustration with the old guard is rising within all the country's political parties. It remains to be seen, though, whether young leaders will find a more promising opportunity anywhere other than their current parties. Events during the next several months may decide whether the new wave is a genuine phenomenon or merely rhetoric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Looking at Kenya's political scene from the West, many observers are inclined to throw up their hands at the seemingly self-destructive tactics used by politicians in the East African nation. Yet democracy is messy even in the West. British Prime Minister John Major has had to survive numerous challenges to his authority. Since the Republican capture of the U.S.  Congress in the 1994 elections, scores of Democrats in Congress and in state legislatures throughout America have defected to the Republican party.  Canada's Progressive-Conservative party was defeated so totally in the last elections that it barely exists as a national entity. Japan has seen the last four prime ministers fail to finish their terms because of official corruption and political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly it is true that Kenyan politicians are not advancing democracy as had been hoped in the heady days after the reinstitution of multi-party democracy in 1991. Still, it would be a tremendous underestimation of the political scene to assume that no advances are being made or are possible.  For the most part, Kenya's political opposition knows what is wrong but has felt powerless to address those problems because of the government's intransigence. The law has been used to stymie democracy rather than support it, but now politicians and members of civil society are joining forces in a long overdue coalition to entrench democracy in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Changes in the constitution and other laws and election procedures would provide a more competitive political atmosphere. This would allow opposition parties to develop normally by permitting them to reach out more effectively to voters. Aggressive enforcement of laws against vote fraud could better guarantee free and fair elections in Kenya. This would mean that no party has a lock on the vote and would be forced to be mindful of the public will.  Continued and enhanced civic education could significantly reduce the percentage of uninformed voters and uninvolved citizens. The creation of new jobs and economic opportunities for the average Kenyan could reduce poverty, and therefore render Kenyan voters less vulnerable to manipulation. None of these possibilities is beyond reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anything can happen in the Kenyan political environment, as has been proven by history. Daniel arap Moi started his political life as a lesser player in the now-defunct Kenya African Democratic Union. He went on to become Kenya's third Vice-President, and as President, he has recreated the ruling party in his own image. The current opposition parties did not exist five years ago, but they now have entrenched supporters throughout the country. With the empowerment of women and the rise of young political leaders, great changes are possible in Kenya. It was not easy in the past and will not be easy now, but with the right conditions, reform is more possible now than it was in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donor nations must not lose hope. The political opposition is working harder to practice the democracy it preaches. It may have taken a circuitous route to get there, but internal democracy is underway. Civil society is no longer content to sit on the sidelines critiquing the political action.  Religious organizations and NGOs will be major players in 1997 -- one way or another. There is a window of opportunity to create a new political order in Kenya. This chance will not last forever. If the challenge of political reform in Kenya is not accepted now, this lost opportunity will be lamented for generations to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - When last Monday Ahmed Dusau, sole administrator of the Nigeria Labour Congress, informed labour correspondents in Lagos of &quot;government's determination to hand over NLC to democratically elected officials,&quot; he exuded the confidence of a prophet. But barely 24 hours after, a meeting of 27 industrial unions held in Lagos saw labour leaders taking a position that has cast a cloud of uncertainty on the possibility of achieving the goal of fully democratizing the NLC in the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gusau had spoken glowingly of government's resolve to end the rather protracted democratization process of the NLC this week. And as the man who is saddled with that onerous task, he decided to set up two committees, the accreditation committee and the conference conduct committee. He assured that members of the committees would be tested veterans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the things to be considered for accreditation are the payment of check-off dues by unions and the conclusion of bye elections by state councils. As at last Monday about 60 per cent of the state councils were said to have concluded their elections as directed by the NLC sole administrator.  Four unions, the National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions Employees, the National Union of Petroleum, Energy and National Gas Workers, NUJ, and National Union of Railwaymen are said to be defaulting in the payment of their check-off dues. As for the conference conduct committee, it is to make arrangements for accommodation, information and all other things deemed necessary for a smooth conference to hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Gusau, the time-table for the conference, scheduled to hold at Abuja, is such that all state councils are expected to round of all bye elections by May 27. The next day would be for the arrival of delegates to the conference, the high point of which is the election to be held between may 29-31. Gusau said that the election would be based on the 1995 NLC constitution as approved by the government. On the contentious issue of Decree 4 of 1996, he explained that all laws in respect of the congress would be applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But labour leaders would have nothing to do with the Gusau arrangement.  Twenty-seven out of the 29 unions which met at the National Union of Postal and Telecommunication Employees secretariat in Lagos, complained that &quot;eight days to May 29, the sole administrator has neither held any meeting nor informed the unions of any plan to hold the conference on the said date.&quot; They also alleged that the trade unions have not been involved in the preparations for the conference, which is not in consonance with the provisions of the NLC constitution. The labour leaders then re-affirmed that industrial unions and state councils would participate only if an NLC conference convened on the basis of the existing constitution of congress with regards to delegates to the conference and the eligibility to contest any elective office of the congress, among other things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They further said that in the light of the above, the Trade unions (Amendment) Decree 4 of 1996, section 7 of which has technically sidelined potential candidates for the election on the grounds of not being &quot;card carrying members,&quot; as well as the guidelines issued March 2 by the labour minister, could not be the basis for convening a truly democratic and legitimate conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the leaders pledged that no union would embark on strike action because of this position, they condemned the attitude of some veterans who have offered themselves to be used by the government in realizing its aims.  They, therefore, resolved to take their case to Sani Abacha, the head of state, whose government they described as a &quot;listening one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution of the labour leaders which formed part of the communique issued at the end of the meeting, is nothing short of a boycott of the conference. Last week, Labour leaders were resolute in their demand for the review of Decree 4, especially section 7 of it. Speaking on the issue to Theweek, A.B. Dania, senior deputy general secretary, Textile and Garment Workers Union, said that the decree seeks to create artificial demarcation between card carrying members of the unions and their leaders. he said that it had never been so, as all the veterans necessarily grew from the rank and file of the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his words, &quot;No one can be a leader without having graduated through the rank and file of the union.&quot; He was categorical that the conference would not hold except the demands of the unions were met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his part, Hassan Sunmonu, past president of the NLC and the current secretary-general of Organization of African Trade Unity, warned that &quot;Nigeria may become a laughing stock in the international labour community if the election of officers for the NLC is conducted under the guidelines given by the minister of labor.&quot; He further said that any president elected for the congress on the basis of the guidelines and decree 4, of 1996, would not be respected nationally and internationally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Like his death and its delayed announcement, burial plans for Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's political icon who passed on, May 11 a t 92, may be mired in controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 10 days during which it had been scavenged by the media, Chukwuma Bamidele Azikiwe last Tuesday finally announced the death of his father, Nnamdi Azikiwe. He confirmed that the Owelle of Onitsha and Nigeria's first and last ceremonial president passed on exactly at 4.45 p.m. Saturday, May 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chukwuma's announcement came after the completion of the different traditional rites necessary for the broadcast of the death of an Owelle, one of the six highest titles in Onitsha, to which Azikiwe, according to Chukwuma, was appointed in the 70's. What had delayed the completion of the rites was the prolonged absence of 73-year old Ofala Okagbue, the Obi of Onitsha, who is abroad on medical check up. The monarch reportedly delegated Valentine, his nephew, to stand in for him as chief coordinator of the rites.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In announcing the death of his father, Chukwuma also confirmed Onitsha as the late sage's final resting place. According to him, the 92-year old one time premier of defunct Eastern Region will be interred at the Inosi Onira family compound at their Ogbeabor village in the commercial city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chukwuma later led a delegation of top family members to Aso Rock where he formally informed Sani Abacha, the head of state, of the death of the former Nigerian president. The head of state promptly ordered a three-day national mourning for the former Nigerian senate president and first indigenous governor-general. The national flag would fly at half-mast for the period of the national mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About the time Chukwuma was meeting Abacha, the constitution of a 31-member all Igbo panel to coordinate the funeral was also being announced.  Already, the committee was reportedly working on a proposal it hopes to submit to the federal government as soon as the mourning period it declared is over. The committee intends to ask the federal government and the governments of the seven eastern states to pick the bill for Zik's burial, on a day yet to be fixed. There are speculations that the foremost nationalist would be buried October 1 as part of activities to mark the country's the country's 36th independence anniversary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speculation that Zik's burial will be delayed for close to five months is already proving a source of potential rift in the family. Uche, Zik's wife of 22 years, is reportedly kicking against the idea. She said her husband detested corpses staying for months in the morgue. She told reporters: &quot;I want him to be buried soon. While he was alive, he criticized the keeping of corpse for a long time...He never felt happy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Far more capable of generating controversy is the accommodating approach seemingly preferred by the Azikiwes in the burial arrangements for their father as against the restricted, conservative requirements of Onitsha tradition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sounding a note of warning, Chukwuma declared when he spoke to reporters last Tuesday: &quot;It was his (Zik's) wish that he should be brought home and interred according to our tradition. But we will amend and bend things respecting the fundamentals. We will accommodate all the various tendencies... We will reach out to all the people that have valid claims of association with our father.&quot; These, according to him, include Nsukka to which Zik retired after his active political career, and Zungeru, his birth place in Niger State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indications of a possible clash have already started to manifest. Twice Olisa Mortune, the traditional prime minister of Onitsha and member of the group of the six capped chiefs among whom Zik counted on till his death, stormed out of the press conference at which Chukwuma formally announced his father's death. After entreaties from the eldest of Zik's sons he returned after first walking into his Volvo car in annoyance. He was said to be protesting alleged violation of tradition by the Azikiwes. This, he reportedly alleged, had become clear from their extending hands of friendship to the corps of reporters who had swarmed around Zik's abode at both Nsukka and Onitsha since the elder statesman died. To Mortune, the reporter' effrontery in reporting Zik's death ahead of the Onitsha Ndichie (council of elders) amounts to an unforgivable desecration of his people's culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will Zik get a prompt burial, and in accordance with Onitsha tradition, or are the remains of the erstwhile publisher of the largest Newspaper chain in Nigerian journalism annals set for a long stay in the morgue? That is the puzzle to be resolved in the he weeks ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Mamman Nasir, former president of the Court of Appeal, and now chairman of the Transition Implementation Committee, discusses the incarceration of Moshood Abiola, the transition programme, and the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek: As chairman of the Transition Implementation Committee, can you give us a self-assessment of the journey so far towards democracy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nasir: To start with, What is transition itself? I believe your interest is in the transition programme announced by the head of state on 1st of October, last year. Our committee was charged with the responsibility of ensuring a successful transition. This transition involves all the matters, all the decisions which have been passed on from the constitutional conference to the government of the federation, which the government has accepted almost a hundred per cent. For ease of reference, you may recall that the present administration upon coming to power appointed the constitutional conference of about 360 delegates. Out of this number, 270 were elected and 90 approximately were nominated. This conference discussed all concepts of Nigeria's national life, and in one full year's deliberation, submitted the draft constitution and so many recommendations. And the conference said, if we practice this constitution and we apply the following recommendations, we are more likely to get a stable government. This is what the present transition programme is all about.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, this programme is already being implemented. There is marked improvement even in the preparation of the annual budget and improving the economy, in trying to clean some of our bad practices, e.g. in the banking sector. We are improving the infrastructure, roads, hospitals, education, and so on. In addition, there is a much greater liaison between the private sector and the government. The sum total of all these is that we are now getting a direction. Now, the constitutional conference said that unless we improve the economy, we improve the lot of the ordinary man, we improve the social services, we improve our roads, we make Nigerians more friendly to each other and to have a sense of brotherhood, there is no amount of election that will bring democracy. All that will happen without these necessities will be an election and after a short period, the military will come back. In other words, we are after a durable democracy, a real democracy by the people and for the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  How much of these has the government achieved?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  Oh, no! It's not for the government to achieve this. It's for you, myself and everybody else to team up and fulfill our own side of the responsibility. For example, government can't come and compel me to be your friend, but I know it's in my own interest to be friendly with the next-door neighbor. So, government counts on all of us to team up, on all of us to be honest, on all of us to work hard. If we all cooperate, instead of dissipiting energy, fighting each other, then Nigeria can be very, very great because we have all the talents, we have the resources, we have everything, it's now a question of teaming up, face one direction and Insha Allah, the result will be in everybody's interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  As chairman of the transition committee, what are the misgivings about the local government election?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  You would agree with me that Nigerians positively responded in support of the elections by coming out en masse to participate, contrary to what few people said that the elections should be boycotted, that nobody should come out. At the end of the exercise, some people were not happy with what happened. In a human society, you cannot have anything happening without somebody saying he is not satisfied, even in a family. And if you take the size of Nigeria, those grumbling are few and they have been given a chance to go to election petition tribunal, after the tribunal you can still go and appeal. So personally, I am happy with the result and I am also very happy that some people have gone to the election tribunal to air their grievances, because if you say every Nigerian is happy, it means a hundred per cent Nigerians have been suppressed. In a human society, you can't talk of a hundred per cent agreement. It has never happened, at least as far as I know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  To me and to a lot of people, the arrangement was quite untidy.  For instance, there was no voters register; people got to the polling centers and were allowed to vote. We also find that a lot of people were disqualified even on the day of the elections. So, what measures are you putting in place to ensure that these do not happen in subsequent elections?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  Except that we allowed people to vote without being registered, nobody has yet told me that no-Nigerians voted. All the people who voted are Nigerians. Now, what happened was this: If you go to the rural areas, this little village community level, they all know each other. What surprised all of us was the size of the electorate. That one made it almost impossible to get the people registered by 2 to 4 p.m. In many respects, the people themselves lined up and they were counted. If there is complaint about that one, whoever is not happy can still go to the tribunal. But I never heard anybody say some people came from Rivers State and there were voting in Ondo State. Or some people came from Cameroon and they were voting in Adamawa State. Nobody complained that way. So, from the experience, so many things will happen. For example, the intention now is to get a voters register. In other words, the next elections will be based on a voters register. From the turnout, we now learn we need more people to register the voters. We also now learn that Nigerians are democratic and know how to exercise their rights.  You always know that Nigerians are democratic. Whatever you think, they come out to exercise their rights. That's the government's goal. Let everybody participate in public life, economic, social, political and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  Since the dream of your committee is to ensure a democratic arrangement, don't you think one of the problems you have is the detention of people? Isn't the committee thinking about how to solve this problem?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  Before the end of this transition, government will break all roadblocks, which are against democracy. I can assure you about that one.  This government is determined to build a strong democracy. Whatever is happening now is to remove all our malpractices, where you believe you have to be hostile to the society before you can acclaim yourself as a political leader. This one I am tailking generally. I am not talking in respect of any particular person. This government says, &quot;look, let us sit together, let us re-organize ourselves, let us get every Nigerian on board so that we can participate in the next administration, whether a very serious politician before or whether you never participated in politics at all. This time around, we all meet together and decide what should be done for Nigeria. We don't want a situation where you get 20 odd people all saying &quot;we want to be president,&quot; some of them even change how they walk just because they personal intention, they want to contest election. No, we want you, the ordinary Nigerian, to show who will be president. We want you at your party level to nominate who should contest which office. I can't come and say I am the president because I have money. We want you now to dictate who should contest any office in the constitution. Now that we are rotating all the offices, we are likely to have more satisfaction, more contentment from the society. I have my views, but my views are absolutely irrelevant. The most important view is that of the people when they form their political parties, get them registered. Our own now is to assist in helping to formulate the bringing up of all of us into the system. I am not interested in which association is registered as a political party. I know some must be registered. But I do not want anybody to say that &quot;this association is mine, so I must be the president.&quot; I want the people to say &quot;this is our association,&quot; then they say in the party, &quot;now that we are registered, who will be senator, who will be member of the house of assembly, who will be president? Remember, if this man is president and we are rotating, then somebody must be prime minister.&quot; The party must then think of how to share the posts in the best way it can get the best result and I hope that, with our present understanding of our country, the party will cut right across, nobody will form a party which is only supported in one particular corner. We hope the political leaders will go all out and get support. We have a common philosophy in Nigeria, we have no political difference as to what we should do for our people. We know it's identical. So I hope all those with intention to play politics should try to trace their friends all over the federation and team up. It is which one is more trusted by the people rather than which one has the best philosophy. We will do our best and build Nigeria on a more sound footing which must be on the basis that the electorate are supporting the government elected by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  Let's get to the unresolved issue of June 12. During the interim administration, you were appointed chairman of a panel that was to investigate what happened to the elections. You would have probably found a way out if not for Wada Nas, now minister of special duties, who got a court order to stop your committee. What is the way out of June 12 crisis?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  I have at least two answers. The smart one is to say that the court order which stopped me from doing the enquiry as far as I know has not been revoked. So I cannot talk on it. (Laughter) But, more seriously, I have links with Abiola's family, Abiola's friends, Abiola's sympathizers. I think we have overflogged this issue at the expense of Abiola himself. We are not helping him. We have to remember that the Nigerians who are now overseas campaigning are no longer talking of June 12, they are now talking of human rights, because that is the thing that will continue to give them money out there. They are no more fighting for Abiola or June 12. They are now fighting for fundamental human rights. They went to Ogoni. They went to everything..  My candid view is that we have overflogged Chief Abiola's case. Abiola was never declared a president in Nigeria. Shehu Shagari was declared president, three months in office, he was removed. Nobody shouted. If we are arguing, then we should go back to 15th January (1966) when our political leaders were removed or killed. June 12 is not higher than the removal of Alhaji Shehu Shagari and is definitely lower than when the prime minister was murdered.  Chief Akintola was murdered. Alhaji Ahmadu Bello was murdered, Brigadier Ademulegun was murdered. All these were part of our history and, upon that, we had a civil war. All these did not break Nigeria. I hope anybody with interest in the welfare of Chief Abiola will please allow this thing to take its simple, straight forward, elementary course. In my view, that will be much better for Chief Abiola and Nigerians as a whole. We should use the experience to make sure that we don't allow the military to come again. Then there will be no more June 12. But if we now continue to talk about June 12, we are really whipping up a dead horse. I am sorry that is my very blunt opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  Don't you think if we allow the cancellation of June 12 to go unchallenged, there will be future cancellation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  That is why I use June 12 as the last straw which broke the camel's back. After this time, nobody can try it again. The only way to do it is to get good government. You see, the whole history of that election leading to June 12 is best not mentioned. As far as I am concerned, let us use June 12 as the last straw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  What would you propound as the solution to the June 12 problems?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  Now, it is in everybody's interest that we get a solution to Chief Abiola's case. If we are sincere, it is best undiscussed in the press.  I think we should deal with the matter somewhere else. You see, anybody coming to the press now is merely trying to boost his ego. Not for Chief Abiola, but for himself. See what is going on in court, lawyers arguing who will represent him. My upbringing in the practice is that, if someone says I am not wanted, I go. But see what is going on. People politicize issues to the expense of every person in the society. No Nigerian would say he hates Abiola. But people are making them to believe that Abiola would have been the worst president in Nigerian, because he was supported by only a small fraction of Nigerians. No. If we want to help him, the best way is to reduce making political stories. Go somewhere else and look for solution in his won interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  The judiciary was indicted by former President Babangida as one of the reasons for annulling the June 12 elections because of the conflicting rulings on the validation of the election. How do you assess the judiciary?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  Now, the judiciary is not at fault because the judiciary has done nothing wrong. Whoever goes to court, the judiciary must listen to him even if it is simply to tell him, sorry, I have no jurisdiction. What a court cannot do is to say you can't enter. Everybody can enter a court. But the court can say: &quot;I hear your very beautiful argument, but, I have no jurisdiction.&quot; What happened before the annulment was that the judiciary gave one judgment in Abuja, another gave an order in Lagos, another gave another order in Benin, another gave an order in Abuja. That time, the judiciary allowed itself to be dragged into a corner. Because of this, at the constitutional conference, we now said all these election cases will now go to a special federal court, the constitutional court. The difference is this: a high court in one state is not bound by the decision of a high court in another state. But this constitutional court is bound by its own decision.  So, if there is a decision in Lagos, that decision is binding on all other states. That was the idea of the conference so that the judiciary will not be dragged into the arena. We limited it to this federal Court so that nobody will give contradictory judgment and one hopes it will help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  What did people like you and former Chief Justice Bello do at that point in time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  Strictly speaking, if a magistrate grade three is charged with a case, no justice, no president should interfere with what he is doing. He should be allowed to finish his case. You don't advise judges as to what they should do. The chief justice could not interfere. In any event, the chief justice is not in charge of a state high court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  At the constitutional conference, the recommendation was made that there should be rotation of the presidency. It was approved. But the government did not go further to say how the zones are going to benefit. Why was that so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  You know this was a highly political matter. The best way to get it done is for the politicians to put their heads together and see how best to do it. If I have my way, the next government will be a national government. In any event, the conference has decided and it is now in the constitution. If a party has 10 per cent of the seats in the national assembly, it has to be represented in the cabinet. So, we are now working towards a national government. Let us give the political leaders the honor that they too can sit and work things out. If they do, it is likely to be more durable than enforcing it on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q.  You have a lot of faith in General Abacha. I want you, from your privileged position, to assess what manner of man he is?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A.  The best way is to interpret what he has done so far. That will tell you the type of man he is. He is not claiming anything more than what your are claiming as a Nigerian. He believes that it is Allah in his wisdom that put him in that position. I will do my best. You can get your own interpretation by analyzing what he has done so far. Examine what the critics have said, examine what the people in his favor have said, compare them with what has actually happened; things which were almost impossible can now become possible in Nigeria. Quietly without making noise, this man has achieved a lot as a matter of what is happening in the society. That is why I say we should analyze and educate our people as to what is going on. It is a silent revolution. You see, nobody before had the courage to probe anybody.  My analysis is that, analyze him on the basis of what he has done so far, compare the negative and the positives and, with all due respect, be honest to yourself in deciding the truth.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Just like last year, football fans in Nigeria may not have the chance to savor a continental cup triumph as things are once again beginning to fall apart with the three clubs representing the country. For those that felt the score draw Rangers International pulled in Cameroon was good enough, the 0-1 lost to Unisport was devastating. Now, the country will have to wait till next year for another chance at the Confederation of African Football Cup.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story was the same in far away Zimbabwe when Shooting Stars, playing in the second leg, second round of the Champions cup, lost 1-3 to Power Dynamos. Although Super Eagles' chief coach Shaibu Amodu blamed the loss on altitude problem, many football fans see it as a lame excuse. Amodu, who is on secondment to the Ibadan side, also spoke of lack of concentration which he said accounted for the goals the Nigerian side conceded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shooting Stars, however, moved to the quarter-finals having defeated the Zimbabwean side 5-1 in Ibadan. Playing against an obviously more experienced Gabonese side, Winners Cup campaigneers, Katsina United, debutants in continental championships, held out until the last 10 minutes when they allowed in three unreplied goals. Officiating was said to be questionable, but the Nigerian clubside reportedly played below average. The host, Mbilinga scored their last two goals within four minutes, one of which was a penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Katsina United have a chance to redeem their image when they square up with the Gabonese side for the second leg, only a miracle will see them getting a quarter-final berth. In the first round when they met Etoile du Congo who beat them twice at home in a second leg match that witnessed a replay, the team was not too impressive. Despite an army of coaches that included Zachari Baraje who just returned from Oman and Kelechi Emetole, the team failed to impress. So, it would be a daunting task for them as they aim to pull four goals behind Mbalinga to move forward in their quest to lift the Mandela trophy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Shooting Stars not looking too impressive despite their array of stars which sole administrator, Taiwo Ogunjobi promised will bring home the Skeou Toure Cup to Nigeria for the first time, Nigerians are beginning to brase up for another bleak year on the continental level. Godfrey Esu, who until recently was head coach of the Ibadan side, believes the same story will continue to be told until certain measures are taken. ESL, who now coaches Nigerdock, believes the best clubsides don't always get to represent the country. This, he says, is because &quot;officiating should be looked into at both home and away matches of the league. Except we improve on that area, we can't really get the true champions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Austin Akosa, CAP instructor, the professional league is far from matching the name it is being called. &quot;The results we have got so far from the continental matches show the level of coaching in the country.&quot; Taking a rather hard look, he believes that something is wrong with the pattern of coaching in the country. &quot;We have to go back to the drawing board,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Sani Abacha's new foreign policy measure aimed at wooing friends from outside the West may have received a huge boost last week. Speaking to the press Tuesday in Abuja, Walter Ofonagoro, information and culture minister, disclosed part of this new policy plan. He said that the government would host a three-day meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in Abuja. The hosting of the conference, is to show the world &quot;that we are still highly accepted by the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside the non-aligned nations, however, the Abacha regime continues to acquire more enemies. Last week witnessed an increase in the ranks of those calling for sanctions against Nigeria for her lowly-rated human rights record and uncertain transition programme. But far worse for the nation's image is the United Nation's report prepared by the five-member fact-finding team that toured the country last month. The report is said to be unfavorable to the government which had expected to launder its battered image by hosting the mission from the world body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the new champions of sanctions against the country, a new body called the Inter-Action Council was formed last Tuesday. The 24-member council is made up of mostly ex-heads of government in Europe. Included in the exclusive list are former president Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France, ex-chancellor Helmut Schmidt of former West Germany, ex-president Mikhail Gorbachev of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada. At a meeting held in Vancouver, Canada, last week, the former leaders of the industrial world expressed disappointment with the Abacha government's continued imprisonment of their Nigerian counterpart, Olusegun Obasanjo, for alleged coup plotting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said they believed Obasanjo has not been tried in a properly constituted court and therefore should be set free immediately. Failure to heed their plea, the international statesmen warned, would not be taken lightly. They recommended the freezing of the foreign assets of Nigerian leaders, the suspension of visa issuance to Nigerian leaders and the stoppage of air links between Nigerian and the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A week to the oldies' meeting, Nigeria had been the subject of a fierce bipartisan debate in the United States Congress. Nancy Kassebaum, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations sub-committee on African Affairs, had authored a bill which was co-sponsored by 22 other senators. The bill called for the imposition of oil embargo on Nigeria. Though the bill could not sail through the house, Peter Tarnoff, U.S. undersecretary for political affairs, who testified before the committee, said the Clinton administration plans to deal with the problem through consensus among its allies. This is expected to top the agenda in Lyons, France, at next month's meeting of heads of eight industrialized nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast, the UN report is more direct, unambiguous and damaging. On the setting up of the Auta tribunal that tried the Ogoni Nine, the report recognized the constitutional provision for the setting up of tribunals such as those for armed robbery and drug trafficking. But it carpeted the government for flouting its own law which states that such a special tribunal must be set up after a report by a duly constituted investigation committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial itself, said the report, followed a procedure that was not fair. It condemned the inclusion of military personnel in the tribunal, the maltreatment of Saro-Wiwa and others in detention and the hasty manner in which the Provisional Ruling Council ratified the tribunals' judgment without &quot;the records of the proceedings which were not yet completed&quot; at the time of the PRC meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team made some bold recommendations on the Ogoni crisis. It urged the government to repeal the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Act of 1987 and let the criminal courts handled such cases in future. Alternatively, members of tribunal should not included the military, members should be appointed on the recommendation of the chief justice and judgment should be appealable. It recommended the improvement of the economy, education, health and welfare of the Ogoni.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Several weeks before the event, he had made it a habit to skip state functions even after elaborate arrangements had been made for his reception. For millions of Nigerians who have no access to the inner recess of the Presidential Villa, the only way they could know that all was well with their head of state was through his prime time appearances featuring courtesy calls by numerous envoys and other dignitaries. But, last Monday, Sani Abacha, the head of state, dismissed speculations that it was in his character to keep away from public glare.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That morning, a workshop on crime prevention and control, organized by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was to get off the ground in Abuja. Abacha was due to attend and government sources even told Theweek that he confirmed his coming. But, as the programme was being delayed, it was feared that the head of state might do an en core of the December, 1994, episode which was believed to be one of the factors that made the Federation of International Football Associations invalidate Nigeria's hosting right for the World Youth championship last year. On that occasion, Nigeria kept the world waiting for 95 minutes for the draws of the ill-fated championship. Abacha, who had earlier assured the organizers of his presence, reportedly declined to attend at the last minute. Even then, it took so long to sort out who should represent the head of state. Initially, it was said to have been agreed that Oladipo Diya, the chief of general staff, who is generally know as the &quot;gamesmaster-general of the federation&quot; because of his penchant for sports, would fit the bill, but Abacha was said to have changed his mind in favor of one of his confidants, Jeremiah Useni, minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. This time, Abacha ended the suspense by making himself available at the workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the programme progressed, the head of state was invited to give a keynote address and flagg off the workshop. And by the time he was through with his speech, it was no longer in doubt that he was set to bare his fangs on corrupt public officers - past and present - and their collaborators. He lamented that in 25 years, Nigeria had invested more than N53 billion in parastatals which were worth only N900 when their assets were privatized in 1992. His countenance was that of gloom as he explained: &quot;The colossal waste of public funds through mismanagement, fraud, embezzlement and other white collar crimes have contributed in no small measure to the poor state of our economy and social services. No administration worth its name can allow this unacceptable situation to continue.&quot; What next? Abacha again: &quot;We have consequently resolved that all those who contributed to the failure of our public institutions and parastatals through monumental mismanagement of public funds will be held to account to ensure that present and future executives of such institutions operate according to set rules and procedure.&quot; Emphasizing that there would be no &quot;sacred cows,&quot; the head of state confirmed the speculations about the coming of yet another anti-corruption tribunal-the Failed Companies and Parastatals Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until Abacha delivers on his promise to release the legal framework for the tribunal, it remains uncertain how far the dragnet would extend in the regime's ethical war. Whether or not they might be a victim of the crusade, some Nigerians have taken sides with Abacha. One of the prominent supporters of the war is Hammed Kusamotu, Chairman of the National Republican Convention, which collapsed with other political structures in the aftermath of Abacha's coup in November, 1993. As far as the lawyer could understand, the new tribunal &quot;is a queer necessity.&quot; He goes on to explain in an interview with Theweek: &quot;That means that this is not what it is, but what it ought to be, that is that nobody should corner public fund and put it in his pocket. Those parastatals have not served the purpose for which they were set up and far worse, the officials take them as their personal property.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That view tallies with that of Ndaeyo Uko, a Lagos journalist. He says of the new tribunal: &quot;I think it is useful. If it will help to sanitize the system, it is okay by me.&quot; He would not be dragged into the belief that Abacha was out to bring his adversaries to their feet, through the anti-corruption war. His query: &quot;Let's look at it this way, if somebody should blow up a prison to free the inmates, would the prisoners ask what his intentions are&quot;?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Abacha then the Messiah Nigerians have longed for to clear the proverbial Aegean stable? To many Nigerians, he does not have the credentials to embark on an ethical war. His legendary wealth is said to include a multi-million Naira mansion in his home town, Kano, and business interest that spans the aviation, oil and hospitality sectors. In the famous Newswatch interview David Mark, the retired brigadier-general who fled the country after falling out with the Abacha regime, described the Ministry of Defense as a &quot;sore point and a no-go area.&quot; For years in the Babangida era, Abacha was in charge of that ministry. And believed to be buried inside the former Defense Headquarters are the secret files of the inferno that wrecked the skyscraper three years ago, the report of the Hercules C-130 plane crash which wiped out a generation of young military officers in 1992, the cost of the Liberian war operations and the audit reports of the defense budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the opinion of his army of critics, Abacha has not come to equity with cleans hands. Listen to Ayo Obe, president of the Civil Liberties Organization: &quot;People say let it (the anti-corruption crusade) start from the top. There is no point blaming the civil servant because his wife got government contract. The thing we know is that poverty is not in their lexicon, I means those at the top. We all know what it takes to build a house in Nigeria today, yet the top men are building houses all over the place. I am not saying you have to be a saint to eradicate corruption, but in politics, appearance is as important as reality. During General Murtala Muhammed's time, he was ready to sin no more and divested himself of his wealth and people were ready to follow him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yinka Odumakin, publicity secretary of the National Conscience Party, supports the CLO president. Says he: &quot;All these tribunals are mere window dressing to hoodwink the masses. $12.4 billion was reportedly missing in the dedicated account during the gulf war era when he (Abacha) and Babangida were the key actors. His cosmetic reforms are to broaden his base, demonize everybody and make the masses helpless. He is out to discredit the elite.  Even as we know that they (the elite) still have one or two questions to answer in terms of our money, it should be done minus Abacha.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Well, it appears Abacha has convinced himself, just like Uko, that all he requires to win the war on corruption is the will, and not his credentials. Asked if Abacha has the moral right to fight an ethical war, Uko goes philosophical: &quot;Even the Pope has no right to wage any ethical war.  However, to wait for a saint before we start something of this sort is to wait for ever. Tell me three people in this country who you think are qualified to wage such a war there may be none. He is qualified, so he has to continue.&quot; And so has Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the beginning, the regime was a bundle of contradictions in many respects, including its attitude to corruption. In his maiden broadcast as head of state, Abacha spoke of the resolve of the regime to be &quot;firm, humane and decisive. We will not condone nor tolerate any act of indiscipline.&quot; He said that probe panels would be set up on the military, the police, the customs, the judiciary, the Nigerian Telecommunications Plc, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, the National Electric Power Authority, the banking industry and the higher educational institutions.&quot; But a few days later at a gathering of senior military officers, Diya contradicted his commander-in-chief when he said that the administration would not waste time dabbling into probes. What it would rather do is to stem further acts of corruption and abuse of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, events took a U-turn many weeks after when Abacha instituted one panel after the other to pry into the records of several organizations.  Among the first set to be probed were some of the acting military administrators who served for three weeks before the administration appointed the first batch of substantive military administrators. The board of inquiry, headed by Oladayo Popoola, former military governor of Oyo State, set out on January 3, 1994, to investigate the brief tenure of four colonels - Dauda Nimyel (Borno State), Ezekiel Coker (Kano), Linus Olorogun (Sokoto) and Abel Akale (Osun) - and two police commissioners - Pius Ahonkhai (Akwa Ibom) and Wadi Ali (Yobe). Of the lot, only Akale was found not guilty on charges of misappropriation of funds and abuse of office. The military court and the army council were said to have been so ashamed of the conduct of the three indicted colonels that they were retired from the army. In the case of the police officers, they were placed on suspension on February 22, 1994, following Diya's instruction to Ibrahim Coomassie, the inspector-general of police. Last year, the police council was said to be waiting for its army counter part to cast the first stone before it censured the commissioners.  Now that the army council had done that, it is not clear the next step the police would take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having dealt with members of his primary constituency, Abacha moved on to other areas. Among the parastatals that he beamed the searchlight on was the NNPC which had a 10-member probe panel headed by Emmanuel Abisoye, a retired major-general. It was to examine payments in excess of N1 million made by the corporation in the last three years in order to identify recipients of any dubious transactions, the amount involved and how to recover them. The panel was also charged with the task of examining thoroughly the present structure, organization and function of the NNPC and make appropriate recommendation for improvement. The re-organization that took place at the NNPC last year, leading to the exit of Chamberlain Oyibo, its group managing director and many other senior officials may not be unconnected with the unpublished report of the panel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the Nigerian Customs Service, believed to be Nigeria's bastion of corruption, the eight-man panel was led by another retired major-general, Paul Tarfa. Among other areas, it was asked to compare and examine Customs operations in other countries, especially that of Indonesia to serve as a possible model for Nigeria. Like the other panels, the report of the Tarfa team has not been released but it is believed to have recommended three redeployment of Samuel Ango, the brigadier-general, who was appointed the sole administrator after the suspension of Bello Mohammed, the comptroller-general, his six deputies and 22 assistants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when last year, Anthony Ani, minister of finance, exposed a N8 billion scam on the clearing of 2,500 non-import duty report containers at the ports, several customs officials were arrested along with customs licensed agents and officials of major shipping firms. In executing the war at the ports, the government introduced sweeping reforms in duty collection and appointed professional accounting firms to take the job of duty collection from customs officials. Despite the slow pace by the accounting firms and the closure of the ports for several weeks, the new order remains in place to the displeasure of customs men and their collaborators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other avenues for easy money are equally being blocked. These include hard drug trafficking, advance fee fraud (well know as 419), and money laundering. Commanding the troop in this sector that has earned Nigeria a bad name in the international community is Musa Bamaiyi, a hard-knuckled major-general and chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency. In one fell swoop last June, he sealed off the premises of 30 car dealers in Lagos, demanding to know the source of their wealth. He impounded about 800 vehicles in the process. Bamaiyi then directed his attention to prominent Nigerians, including sect leaders. Among his victims who spent weeks at the NDLEA detention camp were Sat Guru Maharaj-ji, a controversial spiritual leader, Temitope Joshua, founder of the crowd-pulling Synagogue Church of All Nations, and Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, the Afro Beat King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps Abacha's fiercest battle is that against fraud in the banking sector. Last year, he promulgated the Failed Bank (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Decree No. 18 and set up five tribunals to try bank chiefs and others said to be involved in the multiple financial malpractices that grounded about 50 banks in the last three years. At least 200 bank chiefs are in detention at the Federal Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, Alagbon, Lagos where their detention camp is derogatorily referred to as the &quot;Banking Hall.&quot; Among those in the police net are Femi Adekanye, former executive chairman of Commerce Bank Limited, and Ralph Osayameh, ex-managing director of the bank, both former president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria. Already, the tribunals have jailed at least eight bank executives, including Bello Abubakar, former managing director of Gamji Bank, Onwochei Odogwu, ex-managing director of Kaptial Merchant Bank, and Christopher Anyaegbunam, former director of Group Merchant Bank and son of Fred Anyaegbunam, retired justice of the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the factors which the government claimed led to the fall of Ibrahim Dasuki as the 18th sultan of Sokoto last month was the prospect of his appearance before the Failed Banks Tribunal. The dethroned monarch and 15 other directors of two companies are being accused of complicity in a N775 million owed Alpha Merchant Bank. Dasuki's defense is that he had resigned as director of the indebted company at the time the loan was negotiated and secured. Other big shots now being investigated by the tribunals included Arthur Nzeribe, a controversial politician, and Anthony Hannaniya, a retired major-general and corps marshal of the Federal Road Safety Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now, the new tribunal on Failed Companies and Parastatals may end up being the most all embracing. Giving the nature of the Nigerian economy, virtually all business outfits survive on government contracts which are largely un-executed. In this light, it is believed that Abacha may employ the new law to whip his adversaries in line. Those who may be arraigned before the tribunal may include his political opponents who are believed to be creating problems for the administration, particularly in the international community. One of such victims may be Moshood Abiola, now in the 23rd month of his detention for proclaiming himself president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As soon as Abacha announced the coming of the Failed Companies and Parastatals tribunal, the news was abroad that Abiola may have to answer for the multi-billion Naira telecommunications contract which he won for the International Telephone and Telecommunications in the 1970s. ITT was to have provided telephone lines all over the country under the National Telecommunications Implementation Project. That Nigeria's telecommunication system remains in the Dark Ages is blamed on the failure of ITT to execute the contract. Now that the government is said to be keen on probing the more than 20-year old contract, the move is seen as part of attempts to break what is considered Abiola's steel-like will in the struggle to have his presidential mandate honored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will Abacha see the struggle to make Nigeria a corrupt-free country to the end? Or, will this last initiative end up like his War Against Against Indiscipline and Corruption that was abandoned midway? The answer is in the womb of time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The committee in the U.S. House of Representatives with principal responsibility for foreign aid has approved legislation eliminating all earmarking of funds for sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed bill also cuts $1 billion from the foreign aid budget proposed by President Clinton for fiscal year 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a brief meeting on May 29, the House Appropriations Committee voted to eliminate funding for the Development Fund for Africa, a legislative vehicle established in 1987 to designate money for development projects in Africa. Funding for Africa projects will be drawn from the $1.96 billion the committee allocated for development assistance. The committee approved specific earmarks of nearly $5 billion in funds for Israel and Egypt and close to $1 billion for Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee-approved bill also terminates funding for the Africa Development Bank and makes deep cuts in the U.S. contribution to the World Bank. The U.S. contribution to the International Development Association, a World Bank affiliate which provides substantial assistance to Africa, was reduced by almost 44 percent from the level requested by the Clinton administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foreign aid funding bill, known as the &quot;Foreign Operations Appropriation,&quot; will come to a vote in the full House of Representatives on June 5, according to committee sources. The legislation still must be approved by the Senate before it is sent to President Clinton for signing into law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton administration had proposed $12.8 billion in aid for the next fiscal year, but the Appropriations Committee action cut total funding to $11.9 million. The reduction for the International Development Association (IDA) from the administration's request of $935 million to $525 million accounted for almost half the total cuts. Because of severe slashes last year, the Clinton administration's IDA request this year was primarily designated to meet past obligations to the organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IDA provides loans to the world's poorest countries at below-market interest rates and, according to U.S. Treasury Department officials, is the world's largest lender to projects which contribute to child survival. &quot;For the three billion people living in the world's poorest countries, IDA is the single most important provider of concessional development assistance,&quot; Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other actions taken yesterday the committee also eliminated all funds for the African Development Bank, although last year when this happened the funding was restored in a House-Senate conference committee. The committee increased funding for UNICEF above President Clinton's requested level, boosted funds for international counter-narcotics efforts and voted $600 million for programs effecting children in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Updates on the committee's action is available from the House Appropriations Committee's web site at &lt;http://www.house.gov/appropriations/welcome.html&gt;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political organisations who alienated themselves are not inclined to accept the alternative of a legal, peaceful political process, he said adding unless they take the right path, they go on withering away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa -More than 80 percent of the 206,000 tonnes of relief food required for this year has entered the country, a government official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a news conference he held with local journalists here Wednesday Ato Simeon Mechale, Commissioner of the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission said efforts are under way to secure the remaining amount of relief food until the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are 2.8 million people in the country who needed relief food this year, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the needy are in Wollo, Gondar, Tigray, North Omo of the Southern Peoples' and East Hararge zones of Oromiya regional states, the commissioner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding the activities undertaken during the last nine months, he said training's were given of staff members of regional bureaux of the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission and agricultural professionals on policy familiarisation and employment of mechanisms of early warning system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commissioner said workshops and seminars have been organised for personnel of regional agriculture, education and health bureaux and other pertinent government representative organisations with the objective of raising their awareness on the disaster prevention policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission has not been able to raise the level of knowledge of disaster prevention regional representatives through training because of frequent transfers and changes of persons in some regions he said, adding that as a solution it has been decided that two regional representatives be sent to take part in trainings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Simeon said the commission is selling it numerous heavy-duty trucks to private businessmen in accordance with the policy on the transfer of transport services to the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commissioner said the sale of the trucks is in line with the government policy to leave the transportation of relief grain and commodities to the private sector. He added that a strategic relief fleet is being established, and 55 four wheel drive trucks have been obtained from the German government for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fleet will be used to transport emergency relief aid to areas where private truck owners, mostly because of difficult terrain, refuse to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regarding the current food reserve, Ato Simon said that it was dependable, and of the 307,000 metric tonnes required, 270,000 metric tonnes has been obtained. Efforts are being made to obtain the remaining until the end of this fiscal year, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another problem cited by Ato Simeon was lack of awareness on the part of government agencies and other relevant bodies regarding the fact that implementation of the national policy required their full participation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of us have watched in horror over the past two months as Liberia has descended from hope into despair. Driven by warlords, Liberia has careened off the road to peace and national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only a few months ago, we spoke hopefully of the Abuja peace agreement, of Ecomog's pioneer role as a regional peacekeeping force and of the important contribution which the United Nations, particularly UNOMIL was making to the peace process. A transitional Council of State had been installed and we looked forward to elections in August. We expected Liberia's leaders to complete the remaining steps required under Abuja so that Liberians could finally enjoy the peace they have sought for six long years of civil war. Now the secretary-general tells us in his report that fighting is seriously jeopardizing the Abuja peace process and has reversed the gains made over the past few months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Ambassador Albright observed after her visit to Monrovia in January, the problem in Liberia is a struggle among a few elites for power. In April, these faction leaders demonstrated their commitment to their own interests rather than the good of their people. They re-ignited the violence, turned Monrovia from a safe haven into a war zone, and looted the equipment of relief agencies whose only goal was to help the Liberian people. Today fighters openly drive convoys of stolen United Nations and NGO (non-governmental organization) vehicles around Monrovia. My government was forced to conduct an emergency evacuation of most of the international community from Liberia. Only a few UNOMIL military observers remain and the fighting often precludes them from any attempt to carry out the most basic tasks of their mandate. We are outraged by the looting of the U.N., the NGOs, the churches, the hospitals, and the homes of Liberian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What can we do? The answer is not to abandon Liberia. We agree with the views of the secretary-general in his report -- the international community must remain engaged in the efforts to provide relief and bring peace to the people of Liberia. The regional countries of ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) have taken the lead in this respect. The meeting of their foreign ministers in Accra on May 7 developed a plan to restart the peace process. This &quot;Mechanism For Returning Liberia to the Abuja Agreement&quot; provides concrete steps, including restoration of the cease-fire, withdrawal of all fighters from Monrovia, deployment of ECOMOG throughout the city and restoration of Monrovia as a safe haven, needed to re-start the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These steps are necessary if there is to be continued international involvement. This is the message that my government delivered to the Liberian parties through high-level delegations we sent to Monrovia in the past weeks.  We commend the ECOWAS countries for their clarity of purpose and their dedication in the face of tremendous difficulties. We believe that the Security Council must support this important initiative by the countries of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Accra meeting has given Liberia yet another chance to return to the path of peace. Once again, Liberia's leaders must decide what course to pursue. We hope they will implement the recent agreements reached in Accra.  The Liberian warlords must order their forces to disarm and leave Monrovia in peace. ECOMOG commanders must reassert their control of Monrovia. And the Council of State must begin to act like the transitional government envisaged in the Abuja agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the end of this week, the Security Council must decide on the future of UNOMIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are heartened by the continuing commitment of the ECOWAS states and by the steps ECOMOG has taken to deploy throughout Monrovia. We encourage them to continue such efforts. Therefore, we support extending UNOMIL's mandate for three months. We do so because we have not given up hope for Liberia; hope that Liberians will take hold of their destiny and recover their country from the grip of those who only wish to destroy it; hope that law and order can again be brought to Liberia; hope that Liberia can be liberated from war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the next three months my government will be watching closely to see if any of these hopes are fulfilled. If not, we and the Security Council will have to re-evaluate our approach. Again, we urge all those in Liberia, particularly the faction leaders, to use this time to meet the conditions ECOWAS has laid out and offer their people the chance for peace they deserve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. May 24, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is very concerned about the ongoing trial of opposition editor Magdi Hussein. Mr. Hussein is appealing a conviction under a controversial press law that is currently being revised by parliament. We are writing to ask that the appeal of Mr. Hussein and the prosecution of other journalists be postponed until the parliament has finished its review of this law. The next hearing of Mr. Hussein's appeal is scheduled for May 28.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On January 31, a Cairo court sentenced Mr. Hussein, the editor in chief of Al-Shaab, biweekly organ of the pro-Islamist Labor Party, to serve one year in prison with hard labor, and pay a E (Egyptian pounds) 15,000 fine, and E501 in compensatory damages. The conviction stemmed from charges that Mr. Hussein's paper had libeled Alaa Hassan el-Alfi, the son of the interior minister, Gen. Hassan el-Alfi, by publishing an article that accused him of refusing to pay his bills at a Cairo hotel and trying to bully its managers when they demanded payment. Mr. Hussein has appealed the conviction. On May 8, he was arrested and held for two days for refusing to pay the fine prior to the conclusion of his appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Hussein was tried under Law 93 of 1995, a series of amendments to the penal code pertaining to crimes of publication passed by the People's Assembly and subsequently signed by Your Excellency. Its provisions sharply increase the penalties for crimes of publication and expand the scope of punishable offenses. Penalties for libel have been dramatically increased under Law 93. The minimum jail term for anyone convicted of slander was raised from 24 hours to one year, while the minimum fine was raised from E20 to E5,000. If the slander is directed at a public official or government employee, then the penalty is even harsher -- up to five years in prison and/or a fine of up to E20,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least 20 journalists have been tried or are currently being prosecuted under Law 93. CPJ has written to Your Excellency on several occasions urging the government to repeal Law 93. A bill that would amend Law 93 is currently being debated in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan organization of journalists dedicated to the defense of our colleagues' rights throughout the world, CPJ believes that Mr. Hussein is being prosecuted merely for having exercised his right as a journalist &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media, and regardless of frontiers,&quot; guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The use of Law 93 against Mr. Hussein and other journalists is a clear violation of the principles of the Declaration of Sana'a on Promoting Independent and Pluralistic Arab Media. which were agreed upon by journalists from the entire Arab world, and endorsed by the UN and UNESCO. If Mr.  Hussein's conviction and sentence are upheld, press freedom in Egypt will suffer a serious blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ respectfully urges Your Excellency to instruct the appropriate judicial authorities to postpone Mr. Hussein's appeal hearing and the prosecution of other journalists who are being tried under Law 93 until the revised press law has been enacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Meteorological Department (MET) headquaters here this morning was flooded with inquiries from worried farmers who wanted to know if current freak rains, will continue to destroy their crops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MET acting Senior Forecast Officer, Mr Jacob Nkomoki, said farmers phoning in from as far as from Mkushi and Choma called to find out if the current rains, which they said had washed out their harvests especially that of cotton and maize.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Nkomoki said although this was not a rain season, the drizzle the country was experiencing is as a result of convergence of the moist north-westerlies and dry north-easterlies from the equatorial low pressure area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said tomorrow the country expects more rainfall expecially in Eastern province where more rains is expected and later it will spread to many parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Nkomoki said from yesterday's rains, Lusaka International Airport recorded 22 millimetres, Kafue 11 millimetres, Solwezi 11 millimetres, Mount Makulu two millimetres and City Airport seven millimetres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Although Members of Parliament are entrusted by the people to protect the nation from misrule, because of greed, insatiable appetite for money, fear of losing jobs and business opportunities, they are prepared to see the country go to the dogs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Success for our Members of Parliament has not meant risky defence of principles but ability to trade and comprise democratic ideals for economic and political advantages without shame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our most 'successful' Members of Parliament today are not those who, like Akash-ambatwa, Rodger Chongwe, Katongo Maine, John Mulwila, Emmanuel Kasonde, Rolf Shenton, among others, have stood by democratic principles - however short their stay in Parliament, but those who have sold their souls to become ministers and stay in the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is little doubt that our Parliament is no longer the voice of the people. It lacks the guts to speak for the people, because doing so requires courage and a bit of selflessness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as spineless as it is, our Parliament can only do what involves less risk - it can only support the government; it can only fulfill the wishes of President Chiluba. In doing so it has stopped to be a Parliament of the people and has become President Chiluba's tool - a mouth piece of his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Parliament is a people's weapon that has been captured by scorpions and hyenas and turned against the nation. And it would be naive for the people of Zambia to expect protection from that which is under siege from scorpions and hyenas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For our Parliament to become useful again, the scorpions, hyenas and vultures have to be driven out of it. And this can only be done by the people themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And scorpions, hyenas, and vultures cannot be expected to protect and promote people's interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scorpions protect and promote scorpions interests. Hyenas have not been known to be our good friends and vultures have always been opportunistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have tried very hard not to write about what happened in Parliament last Wednesday. But I have failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been extremely difficult for me to remain silent on the passing of the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill in parliament, and the expulsion of Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika from Parliament last Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not to oppose the constitution amendment deceit, or corruption, and Akashambatwa's expulsion from Parliament , I need to suppress in me what is best in human beings - courage, love for justice, anger against evil and compassion for the downtrodden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To remain silent to President Frederick Chiluba's fraudulent and fascist constitution and Akashambatwa's clearly unjust exclusion from Parliament by Speaker Robinson Nabulyato, I need to commit suicide as a thinking being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament is in many ways a platform and public court where different interests contend and fight it out in debate. But without an independent umpire or Speaker, fair debates and judgments are impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While a Speaker is generally expected to be independent and fair, Nabulyato is required to be loyal to President Chiluba and the ruling MMD - at whose pleasure he serves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nabulyato cannot continue to be Speaker if he stops running Parliament as per President Chiluba's whims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Nabulyato, as one who was resurrected from a political grave by the President and the MMD, all his thoughts of fairness and justice must have been replaced by the single 'need' of keeping President Chiluba happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simple logic, however dictates that the Speaker and indeed all members of parliament, should be loyal to Zambia and national interest should automatically come before loyalty to one man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in President Chiluba's Zambia,the politics of poverty and sycophancy make logic sit on its head. Zambia's history clearly demonstrates the need for a good non partisan constitution that is not based on the interests of the political leadership in power at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tides of public opinion continually shift but the value of a good constitution? is unmeasurable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today's popular political leaders may be tomorrow's dictators. And today's rejected 'political' stones may be tomorrow's nation's corner stones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial leaders of our country's independence struggle, like Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula, fell out of favour with the rank and file membership of their parties but today they are glorified by the same people who despised and insulted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe left UNIP in 1971 to form the opposition UPP he was called all sorts of names by ruling party cadres like Sikota Wina, who are today singing praises to the memory of the man they so viciously fought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former president Kenneth Kaunda, one of the most popular leaders of our country's and indeed the region's liberation struggles, was in 1991 rejected by his political 'fans' who felt he was a dictator who had brought untold misery unto them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba, probably the most popular trade unionist in our country's history, replaced Kaunda as the new Moses almost five years ago but today he would be lucky to even get anywhere near Purgatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba, the trade unionist, the people's choice, the bulwark of the anti-corruption struggle, and a champion of democracy and justice is today considered the negator of all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaunda is no longer the hated dictator of 1991. His popularity has since then increased greatly to enable him give a good challenge for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Chiluba is today considered anti-people and anti-justice. The Chiluba of today awards salary increments without negotiations to parliamentarians but denies civil servants decent wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chiluba of State House is seen as being permissive to corruption and drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chiluba of Plot 1 turned a blind eye to the criminal plunder of University of Zambia land by his ministers, friends and probably by himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba, the President of the Republic of Zambia, as opposed to the trade unionist, believes in repression. In March 1993 he declared a state of emergency that enabled him to arrest, detain and maim some members of opposition UNIP. And his Parliament detains journalists indefinitely without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chiluba of today, as opposed to the Moses of 1991, adopts and enacts a fraudulent constitution that robs many citizens of their rights and downgrades their citizenship just preserve his hold on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People change! Some people would, however, say they don't change; we simply didn't know them and we are permitted to know them better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This being the situation a &quot;good&quot; constitution, that is tailored to cater for President Chiluba, or to cut out former president Kaunda's political come back, is necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expulsion from Parliament last Wednesday of National Party member of parliament Akasham-batwa confirmed what I have always said that our National Assembly is not a people's Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akashambatwa's expulsion also confirms that our Parliament can't even fairly arbitrate in conflicts between members of the executive and other citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whenever there is a conflict between anybody and the executive - even over non partisan issues like the constitution - our Parliament always acts as the defender of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Akashambatwa criticised Parliament's detention of Post editors without trial, at the instigation of the executive through Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda, and asked for them to be taken to court or set free, the Speaker behaved in the most dishonourable way by condemning and expelling him from the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the principles Akashambatwa was defending were same ideals that Parliament should have been defending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, it seems, anyone who comes into collision with President Chiluba's government should expect to also be attacked and, in some way, punished by Parliament.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Lusaka's Hotel Intercontinental would have gone up in flames, causing extensive damage to property and human life, had police not detonated the bomb found in a briefcase last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police sources confirmed to The Post yesterday that bomb experts had found what they are calling low grade bombs in the briefcase picked up in one of the hotel's toilets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said the bomb, which was in many respects similar to the one which blew up part of the security wall at State House a fortnight ago, would have ignited a fire in the hotel building.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The bomb was a simple home made one from ordinary cells. It was in itself not bound to cause much damage to the hotel building,&quot; the police source said. &quot;But there were small plastic containers the size of drinking bottles, which had petrol in them and were stashed in the same brief case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police said the explosion would have lit up the petrol causing a fire which could have eventually affected the electrical system in the hotel building with a possibility of setting the building ablaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not looking at a guy or guys who are merely playing games, because with every attempt there is a potential threat to human life and property,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was panic at Hotel Intercontinental last Thursday when a man claiming to be part of the Black Mamba phoned the hotel warning them of the bomb and urging them to evacuate their guests from their rooms because there was a bomb in a brief case within the hotel. The bomb was expected to explode within 30 minutes of the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On suspicion hotel staff identified an unaccompanied briefcase which had been lying in a toilet near the hotel lobby for sometime. Their guess was right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia and South African police experts, called in to help track down the Black Mamba and check its likely bomb attacks, later opened the case and found the bomb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not an issue to ignore it as a mere scare,&quot; the source said. &quot;The bomb was real, not as fatal, but its location was strategically dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first bomb attack by the Black Mamba was a fortnight ago when they brought down parts of the security wall at State House, close to President Chiluba's official residence. They are understood to have used &quot;simple explosives made from radio cells&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Black Mamba has warned of deaths of selected government officials and the National Assembly Speaker for passing what it has termed as a discriminatory and dictatorial constitution against popular will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far police have been fishing widely making random interrogations of people at the slightest suspicion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By yesterday they were still interrogating former Zambia Air Force Captain Selemani Pangula over the matter. They have also claimed the Black Mamba is using public telephone booths to announce its attacks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Movement for Multiparty Democracy is currently running an advertisement which shows a clip of KK predicting chaos and violence if MMD was voted into power in the general elections in 1991. Then in typical the &quot;Emperor is not naked &quot; style that is characteristic of MMD, the advert concludes that KK lied. Apparently the Zaireans in government are happy that they have achieved what Owen Sichone calls the Zaireanisation of Zambia in a record of five years where it took their brother Mobutu some 30 years of anarchical management of the richest country in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MMD campaign advert of KK has made me acknowledge what I believe is the most fearsome characteristic of the former President viz his vast and accurate knowledge of human scoundrels which enabled him to contain and use them in the governance of Zambia, be it in the trade unions or elsewhere for 27 years without their breaking out like the plague and destroying the fabric of society in the manner in which they have done over the past five years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From what must have been obviously an intimate knowledge of his former colleagues in UNIP and the unions, KK described the &quot;Nazis&quot; in government as frightened little men who would bring chaos, violence and disunity in the country. And we all cried sour grapes, yet it is now clear that not even KK's knowledge and caution to us about the Frankenstein Monsters the people liberated KK's captivity prepared for the chaos and violence that has been unleashed against the country by the MMD government, parliament, police force (Francis Ndhlovu), drug traffickers, thieves and the bastard Christianity which has brought drought and out of season rains as punishment for the desecration of a God whose one description is Holy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia has been reduced to a Sodom and Gomorrah where drug traffickers stand on the hallowed steps of the Supreme Court (repeat Supreme Court) and demand of the heroes in DEC that are fighting a relentless war against the sin that is drug trafficking that they should leave them alone to continue destroying lives, perpetrate murder and use their blood money to rule over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First and foremost, I would like to apologise to the DEC that as a citizen of this country and a voter I have allowed a situation of total and complete anarchy in which an individual like Sikota alias Saddam Hussein Wina and his spouse properly arraigned on drug trafficking charges can threaten and ridicule a people's institution responsible for the social, political and economic well being of the nation at will and continue to masquerade as leaders. Secondly, I would like to disassociate myself from a belief that citizens deserve their leaders. I do not deserve the Winas and I do not recognise their leadership and therefore Quett Masire, Nelson Mandela and indeed Mungole and his boys should not hold me accountable for the actions and utterances of these representatives of a corrupt and unjust party in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The choice of the Supreme Court steps as the venue of an address to the nation warning the DEC to allow the trade in drugs to be conducted in peace also signified the surbodination of the judiciary to a parliament and executive dominated by drug barons, thieves, racists etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why Wina accused the DEC of having a political agenda thereby paraphrasing a provision from the MMD Constitution which provides for the dismissal of judges who who may be courageous enough to find against the Winas of the consequences. Wina's performance at the steps of the Supreme Court defined in stark and naked terms the nature and purpose of the devil's covenant that has just been enacted as the Republican Constitution. It is a document intended to entrench and protect criminality of the worst order in the MMD bastard Christian nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am sure that the Wina-type of press conference is not the last; it is merely the first in a long and macabre parade of MMD leaders who would have defrauded the Bank of Zambia out of millions of kwacha, beaten up women, murdered ordinary people in cold blood, consigned an entire nation team to the ocean, committed genocide of the youth through drug trafficking and so on ad infinitum at which they will stand outside the Supreme Court telling the people of Zambia, bereaved families, children, men and women whose lives have been destroyed by drugs, the judiciary, the DEC, men of integrity in the police and ACC, that there is nothing we can do about it; the blood shedding, the robberies from the public treasury, the drug traffickers are all protected by the Constitution enacted for we the murderers and robbers in MMD for our protection and continuity and against the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently and in conclusion I would like to give notice that I am not bound and I will not consider myself bound by the Wina Constitution (The MMD has merely reproduced Wina's submission to the Constitutional Review Commission- it should be called the Wina document).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this effect, I intend to take measures within my capacity as a woman, mother and human being to protect myself and my basic fundamental and inalienable God-given rights from a law made in Sodom and Gomorrah. The Bible says that if only there had been ten or five resistance fighters like myself Sodom and Gomorrah would not have been buried under volcanic lava.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Police yesterday failed to prevent UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda from driving through the town centre soon after his arrival from Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police, who stationed officers at various points along the route from Lusaka International Airport, were unable to stop the more than two kilometre long UNIP motorcade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to UNIP's Peter Lishika, both Inspector General of Police Francis Ndhlovu and commanding officer for Lusaka division Wynter Kabwiku emphasised that former president Kaunda should not be allowed to drive into the city centre on his arrival.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The two officers were emphatic that Kaunda should not drive into the city. Ndhlovu even suggested that Kaunda visits the city three days after his arrival,&quot; Lishika disclosed in an interview last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former president Kaunda drove into the city's Freedom Way, Cairo Road and Church Road amid chants from his supporters of &quot;No Kaunda, No Election&quot; which overshadowed the ruling party's own march to State House to witness President Chiluba's signing of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;An attempt to stop us was made at Lusaka Central Police Station. I saved the police from action which would have brought shame to this nation,&quot; former president Kaunda said in an interview at his Kalundu home. &quot;I told the people that time for action will come and when I tell them to act, they should act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNIP president, who claimed his party was in a stronger position, told chanting supporters, who gathered at the party's Freedom House headquarters that nothing would stop him from standing as UNIP's presidential candidate in this year's election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no question of anybody stopping me from standing unless he can exhume my parent's bones or my umbilical cord from where they were buried,&quot; president Kaunda challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier Kaunda told hundreds of supporters who gathered at the airport to meet him that President Chiluba's constitution had introduced a new apartheid in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's apartheid being introduced by thieves. We fought it in colonial times and won. We are going to win this one too,&quot; Kaunda declared. &quot;This is a second liberation and we are in a happy and stronger position. They have no hope at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And alluding to the signing ceremony of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill, Kaunda, who was not referring to the same time frame, said: &quot;In 1953 whites celebrated after federation was created but ten years later the people won. We will first fight in courts. I don't think the courts will fail.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition parties and civic organisations yesterday criticised President Chiluba for assenting to the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCPJ), which had campaigned heavily for a constituent assembly mode of adoption of the constitution, called Chiluba's assenting &quot;a narrow victory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The lack of euphoria and joy by the majority of Zambians is indicative that this victory has been won at great cost by the MMD,&quot; CCPJ chairman Father Joe Komakoma said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Komakoma added that there was need for the MMD to discuss with various interested groups to arrive at a consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is never too late, let us sit down and consider this as a nation,&quot; he advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) president Dean Mung'omba said President Chiluba's action was expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He means no good, he wishes to stretch society to the limit,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot;It is a selfish way to govern, it is very sad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba said President Chiluba's only intention in the constitution was to bar some people from contesting the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberal Progressive Front chairman Roger Chongwe said political parties had done their best to conscientise the public about the dangers but its was now up to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If people are happy with Chiluba's law then so be it, we have done our work for the country,&quot; he said. &quot;It is up to the people to accept this discriminatory constitution or tell him they don't want it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party general secretary Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika said the assenting of the Bill is a betrayal of the original cause of the MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The signing of the bill signifies his own failure to democratise. He has failed to rise up to the required level of statesmanship,&quot; Lewanika charged in an interview yesterday, adding: &quot;This is indicated by the fact that the whole signing process was turned into a petty party affair.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lewanika also attacked President Chiluba for what he termed &quot;addressing an illegal procession at State House&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chiluba is being hypocritical by saying he is law abiding when he was presiding over a march which took place without 14 days notice to the police,&quot; Lewanika said. &quot; He showed the way of breaking law and destroyed his credibility to hold somebody else to the standard of being law abiding.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Constitutional Amendment Bill, which passed through the three customary stages of Parliament last week, was today signed by President Frederick Chiluba into law at a colourful function held at State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba appended his signature to the new law at 13:05 hours (11:05 hours GMT) amidst waves of whistling, ululations and rolls of drumming from thousands of ecstatic Movement for Multi-Party Democracy party supporters who turned up for the occassion clad in campaign t-shirts and body wrappers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The signing of the new law came four hours after the Supreme Court of Zambia threw out the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) application for a grant of stay, to refrain President Chiluba from endorsing the Constitutional Amendment Bill - with no costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Making a ruling, Chief Justice Mathew Ngulube sitting with Justice Bonaventure Bweupe, Justice Matthew Chaila, Justice Denis Chirwa, and Justice Westone Muzyamba reaffimed the high courts refusal to grant ZDC a stay in April.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the case had very little legal facts thereby making it difficult for the appellants to argue substantially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chief Justice said the Supreme Court had no choice but to reaffirm the decision of the High Court and the bench consequently referred the matter back to the subordinate court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Justice Ngulube also noted that it was not impossible for Parliament to have used Article 79 to amend the Republican Constitution as the appellants put it, but that the case required more time to prepare a detailed judgement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And speaking after the judgement was delivered ZDC President Dean Mung'omba told his supporters that the ruling was 'shameful'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the people of Zambia have been denied justice by the highest court in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He assured his supporters that the fight was still on despite the outcome of the ruling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC last week appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court's refusal to grant them a stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time as the Supreme Court was delivering its judgement against the ZDC, hundreds of MMD supporters begun gathering for a grand six kilometre march from the Freedom Statue in down-town Lusaka to State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The thousands of singing, whistling and banner waving supporters brought traffic to a halt as they wound their way uphill from the assembly point to the seat of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the hour struck 13:00 (11:00 hours GMT) motorists supporting the government on the Constitution let loose a cacophony of hooting, whistling and ululations, not only in Lusaka, but spontaenously in all other major centres of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These were supporters of a movement which was urging citizens throughout Zambia to ''honk for Zambia - Zambia for Zambians''. Where there was no car horn supporters were being urged to beat drums, whistle or bang any object that would yield maximum noise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At State House, where the President was signing the bill, a mighty and deafening roar went up at 13:00 hours as Mr Chiluba emerged from State House and walked majestically to where the instruments to be signed were waiting for his attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the President appended his signature to the Bill, bringing all speculation which had surrounded the exercise to an end, an even greater sound errupted from the assembly which took a great effort to control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking afterwards President Chiluba reiterated his earlier contention that the new law was not aimed at any Zambian in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''This Constitution, as amended is not aimed at protecting or including one person or excluding anyone individual person. Some of our people have the impression that this was intended to exclude Dr Kaunda - far from it,'' Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He observed that even the composition of the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission had favoured members of opposition parties in that it was broad based.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that Non-Governmental Organisations had been represented in full force together with Chiefs, representatives of the Church and professional organisations like Law Association of Zambia and Press Association of Zambia in addition to members from opposition parties and the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''The idea was to dispel any fears that anybody might have that in fact we are going to doctor, change or alter anything from the recommendations of the Review Commission. This composition shows that we have no desire to doctor it,'' Mr Chiluba said adding that nobody should, therefore, turn round and accuse government of tampering with the submissions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He described the collated data, opinions and wishes of the people as submitted to the Review Commission as 'a plebiscite' adding that the point of restricting the presidency to an indegenous person was not new as it had been submitted even to the Mainza Chona Commission of 1972. The submission even then was that for anybody to aspire to the position of President, he or she must be an indegenous person whose parents are Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government of the day ignored this submission totally and the question then was not about the mode of adoption but this submission itself.  ''Because of propensity for power UNIP ingnored it,'' Mr Chiluba observed adding that it had also ignored a submission that the President should only serve for two terms after which ''he should go farming, lecturing, or sit down tired'' - which would have brought the politics of Zambia in line with those of Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''There is no one individual who can outlive their own generation. You will be relevant for a particular time and after that ideas will look quite strange to you,'' he said amid much cheering and laughter from the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba recalled that between 1964 and 1991 Americans had changed Presidents five times, the British - about four times, while the Germans, and the Italians ''more than 20 times'' while Zambians had 'remained stuck with one leader.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''There is nothing wrong with the leader continuing if there is a democratic process. But Zambia is not all together a parliamentary or presidential system but a corruption of both,'' he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba noted that though some people were complaining of having their rights infringed in fact they were forgeting that their rights even in Europe would not be recognised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the opposition United National Independence Party, Mr Chiluba recalled how he had wanted to help make provision for former President Kenneth Kaunda stand 'for the last time in coming elections' but that his plans had been frustrated by the very people whom he had wanted to help - UNIP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that at Committee stage he had arranged with the Ministry of Legal Affairs to include a 'proviso' which would have enabled Dr Kaunda to stand on the post of President, 'for we know he has no support' but at the last minute this plan had been frustrated by UNIP who staged a walk out after earlier endorsing a submission from nominated Member of Parliament Vincent Malambo which entailed that only a person who had not served two terms could stand on the position of President could aspire to become President of the Republic again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba pointed out that he was not driven any other consideration but to fulfill the wishes of Zambians in signing the new bill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The government has finally confirmed the privatisation of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) giving details of how it will be carried out. Finance minister Ronald Penza promised donors at the Consultative Meeting in Bournemouth last January that the government would quickly privatise the conglomerate in line with country's cooperating partners' demands for transparency and good governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press conference at the Ministry of Finance yesterday, Penza announced that cabinet has accepted the recommendations of the Rothschilds Report on the privatisation of ZCCM.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The privatisation will be conducted in two stages with the first being the unbundling of ZCCM's major interests into four packages. The second will be the sale of shares in the remaining entities of ZCCM to the public and other international investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By mid-1997, the government hopes to have concluded negotiations of the first stage. The four packages are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the Konkola Deep Mine and Concentrator together with the Mufulira Mine, Concentrator and smelter and refinery;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the Nchanga mines, tailings leach plant and concentrator together with the Nkana mines, concentrator, smelter and cobalt plant;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - the Baluba and Luanshya mines and concentrator, the decommissioned Luanshya smelter and Ndola refinery and the Chambishi cobalt plant; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> - ZCCM's electricity transmission, distribution and generation assets which have been owned and operated by ZCCM over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first package comprising the Konkola Deep Mine has been the subject of negotiations between ZCCM and the government on the one hand, and also of negotiations between the consortium led by Anglo American Corporation and the government over the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Penza confirmed that talks with Anglo American are leading to an agreement for the transfer of majority interest in Konkola Deep to the Consortium. The Consortium is in turn to commit itself to finance the development of the Konkola Deep Mining Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the second stage of the privatisation, ZCCM is to remain a single holding company with minority shares in the packaged interests. However, even these minority shares may be all be off-loaded onto the market by 1998 for the public and any other interested investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The packages will be negotiated by the Zambia Privatisation Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZCCM's other assets including schools, hospitals, and non-mining subsidiaries have all been recommended for private ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on the resolution of ZCCM's formidable debt burden, Penza revealed that the debt stock would be covered in the negotiation over the packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where, for example, government was supposed to own 80 per cent, it might only remain with 20 per cent,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also confirmed that by 1997, ZCCM would have finished with its retrenchment exercise. &quot;We will not leave the trimming of the workforce to the new owners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Professional players Elijah Litana and Joe Bwalya have been included in the Zambia national soccer team that leaves for a World Cup qualifier against Sudan today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trainer Rolad Pouslen, has picked an 18-man final team that includes premier side new comers Rumlex's centre forward, Cosmas Banda and Hector Chilombo as the only two new faces that were not in the Zambian side that clinched a bronze-medal finish at the Africa Cup of nations that were held in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I expect Joe Bwalya to join the team in Sudan, I talked to him recently and he promised he is coming for the match. But for Litana, though I haven't talked to him, FAZ officials have promised that he is also coming,&quot; said Poulsen in an interview yesterday at the BP sports complex where he was having a final work-out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also in the team are goalkeepers James Phiri, Davies Phiri, defenders Hillary Makasa, Jones Mwewa, Harrison Chongo, Mordon Malitoli, while Alex Namazaba, John Lungu, Vincent Mutale, Kenneth Malitoli, Aggrey Chiyangi are the midfielders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team's attacking system will be centred on Dennis Lota, Mwape Miti and Andrew Tembo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Poulsen, who disclosed that he had decided to put Shy Kumwenda, Edward Kangwa and Limbi Mbewe on stand-by, announced that he will only travel to Sudan with Ashios Melu as his assistant while the two other assistants, Fighton Simukonda and Patrick Phiri will join the team when it returns because of the limited number FAZ has asked the coaching staff to provide for the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Lota said he feels Sudan could prove tough to Zambia's quest for a smooth passage to the 1998 World Cup finals slated for France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They haven't lost at home and that is an indication that they are a tough team,&quot; warned the player in an interview yesterday at the Intercontinental hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the run up to the SA '96, Sudan, who were placed in Group Four, held Egypt 0-0, Algeria 0-0, beat Uganda 3-1 and went on to record another 2-1 win over Tanzania, but it was only in the away matches that they lost out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Lota was confident that Zambia would still play a tough match against Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The major advantage we have is that we have played together for some time and with all the preparations we have had we will surely give them a good game. The game will be tough but we will try to at least manage a draw,&quot; Lota said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The imposition of a wage freeze by the government will attract industrial unrest, the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) warned in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issuing the warning in an interview yesterday, ZCTU vice-president Austin Liato wondered why &quot;it was only the workers who were made to sacrifice during the restructuring of the economy&quot;, when emoluments of members of parliament and other politicians were last week increased without even debate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As far as we are concerned at the ZCTU, enough is enough,&quot; Liato carped. &quot;Workers are already receiving meagre salaries and we feel we have sacrificed too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liato added: &quot; If anything it is the worker who is sacrificed in this restructuring of the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liato was reacting to a government circular issued by Secretary to the Cabinet Aldridge Adamson, dated April 17 this year, stating that all grant aided institutions should be informed that there would be no salary and wage increments funded by the government this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Liato said the action was tantamount to &quot;slavery&quot; by the government on an already over taxed worker due to government's failure to broaden the tax base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are not going to sit back and watch the government encourage slavery,&quot; Liato warned. &quot;If the government does not rescind its decision then there will be industrial unrest in this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liato wondered why the government was dictating on industrial terms when the rest of the economy was liberalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; It's a contradiction by the government. It's surprising because the government on one hand has liberalised the economy,&quot; Liato said. &quot; The labour movement should also be allowed to bargain but in this case we were not even consulted before the decision was arrived at.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> United Nations - Sylvana Foa, spokesman for the secretary-general,<BR>told correspondents at today's noon briefing that the secretary-general<BR>had sent to the President of the General Assembly and to the secretaryNigeria as well as the interim response from that Government.<BR>general of the Commonwealth, the report of the fact-finding mission to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The secretary-general was encouraged by both the cooperation that his<BR>special envoy, Lahkdar Brahimi, had received from the Nigerian<BR>Government as well as by its interim response. The secretary-general<BR>believed the response provided him with a good basis to pursue his good<BR>offices as requested by General Assembly resolution of 11 March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This morning, she continued, the secretary-general had spoken with<BR>South African President Nelson Mandela and had told him about the<BR>progress made in regards to Nigeria's fact-finding mission report. He<BR>had also told President Mandela about efforts made to resolve the<BR>problems in the Bakassi Peninsula. The secretary-general had also spoken<BR>with the President of Cameroon, Paul Biya, regarding the Nigerian<BR>willingness to discuss the situation in the Bakassi Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its interim response to the recommendations to the fact-finding<BR>report, the Government of Nigeria had made five points, Ms. Foa said.<BR>The first was that the Civil Disturbances Act -- under which Ken Saroamendments.<BR>Wiwa and eight others were tried and convicted -- would have two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first amendment would exclude members of the armed forces from<BR>serving on the Special Civil Disturbances Tribunal. The second said its<BR>verdicts and sentences must be subject to judicial review, at the<BR>appellate level, before confirmation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second point made by the Nigerian Government stated that the Oil<BR>and Mineral Producing Areas Development Commission would be directed to<BR>look into whether there were peculiar ecological and environmental<BR>problems in the Ogoni area, Ms. Foa said. &quot;The Federal Government will,<BR>with vigour, join the concerted efforts currently being undertaken to<BR>reconcile all parties in the Ogoni region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third point said the head of state had directed the immediate<BR>review of the cases of all persons currently being detained without<BR>trial under decree No. 2 of 1984, as amended, Ms. Foa said. Very shortly<BR>such persons would be released based on an assessment of the individual<BR>merit of each case. Point number four made by the Nigerian Government<BR>was that decree No. 2 of 1984 would be amended to allow for the periodic<BR>review of each case by a body comprising the Chief of General Staff, the<BR>Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General of the Federation<BR>at an interval of three months. That decree presently permitted the<BR>detention of persons, suspected of engaging in acts prejudicial to State<BR>security, without trial and for an indefinite period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the interim response stated that the 1994 decree which<BR>ousted the jurisdiction of courts to issue a writ of habeas corpus to<BR>persons detained under decree No. 2 of 1984, would be repealed, Ms. Foa<BR>said. The Nigerian Government had also told the secretary-general that<BR>other aspects of the report were currently under serious consideration.<BR>The secretary-general would be closely following the implementation of<BR>the undertakings in the interim response, she added.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> United Nations - At a press conference at Headquarters this morning,<BR>Manzi Bakuramutsa, Permanent Representative of Rwanda, told<BR>correspondents that his country was calling for an emergency meeting of<BR>the Security Council to take immediate action to prevent genocide in<BR>eastern Zaire, where at least 3,000 Tutsis of Rwandan origin were<BR>surrounded by the same extremist forces that had massacred 1 million<BR>Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Bakuramutsa emphasized that despite strong pleas by the<BR>International Committee of the Red Cross, Medecins sans Frontieres and<BR>other groups, the United Nations and the international community had not<BR>taken corrective action to halt the bloodshed. Medecins sans Frontieres,<BR>an international humanitarian organization, had warned that unless<BR>urgent action was taken at least 3,000 Tutsi families were likely to be<BR>massacred by armed extremists. On 12 May, approximately 100 Tutsis<BR>living in Zaire were slaughtered in an attack on a Trappist monastery in<BR>Mokoto. More than 65,000 had fled their homes in Zaire's Masisi region<BR>since April to escape ethnic violence. The conflict in Masisi had<BR>displaced approximately 250,000 since late last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He went on to say that the extremists were the same military forces<BR>of the former Rwandan government who had fled to Zaire in 1994 and now<BR>operated there with impunity. He said they were receiving support from<BR>soldiers of Zaire and thus from the Government of Zaire. Three countries<BR>-- the United States, Belgium and France -- had supposedly agreed to<BR>pressure President Mobutu of Zaire, but the &quot;troika&quot; was no longer<BR>performing its task. He pointed out that while President Mobutu had been<BR>denied a visa to visit the Carter Center in Atlanta, Georgia, United<BR>States, he had been given a visa to enter France. France was obviously<BR>giving support to the President of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations could have taken action, he continued, but the<BR>Security Council did not seem to know what was going on in Zaire. That<BR>indicated a negligence on the part of the United Nations regarding<BR>Rwanda. There seemed to be a double standard at work in the United<BR>Nations when it came to dealing with problems of some small countries.<BR>Many of the things the United Nations wanted to do in Rwanda ran counter<BR>to the needs and wishes of its Government. Whatever solution the United<BR>Nations had brought to the problems in Rwanda seemed to be the<BR>inappropriate one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited the example of the &quot;famous office&quot; that the United Nations<BR>wanted to establish in Kigali. The purpose of the office was not clear.<BR>Rwanda had no problem with the establishment of the office and was quite<BR>willing to accept it, but the United Nations kept talking about it and<BR>could not decide what the office would do. Instead of dealing with a<BR>situation where people were dying, the United Nations seemed more<BR>interested in such things as the disposal of &quot;unserviceable equipment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations was incapable of dealing with the group that was<BR>infiltrating into Burundi, Rwanda and now Uganda, he said. Rwanda had<BR>advised the United Nations for a long time on what action could be<BR>taken, but the United Nations did not listen. The Organization claimed<BR>to be consulting with the Rwandan Government, but it ignored what the<BR>Government proposed. Rwanda wanted help in addressing the situation in<BR>Zaire, before it was too late and the people were exterminated. The<BR>problems of the region had been addressed in pieces and not in a<BR>holistic manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To a question about the overall picture in the region, the Ambassador<BR>stressed that the culture of impunity was the greatest problem facing<BR>the region. People who had committed genocide were not punished. Such<BR>impunity encouraged those same people to continue their killing, to<BR>continue to attack Rwanda. It sent a message to the people in Burundi to<BR>do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked what Rwanda expected from the Council and from the<BR>Organization as a whole, he replied that the Council should condemn the<BR>situation and take action. He had written a formal letter to the Council<BR>President requesting that action be taken and had spoken with a<BR>representative of the Non-Aligned caucus in the Council. He noted the<BR>action that the Council had taken in Sudan over just two people who had<BR>been accused of criminal activity. Why couldn't they take as much action<BR>in the situation in Zaire where there were many more criminals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five permanent members of the Council were aware of the<BR>situation. However, while the people who were responsible for the<BR>killing in Rwanda were moving with impunity throughout the world, some<BR>members of the Council appeared to be protecting them. Although the<BR>United Nations always seemed to do things that harmed rather than helped<BR>Rwanda, such as the arms embargo or the continuation of United Nations<BR>Assistance Mission for Rwanda, he wanted the Organization to face its<BR>responsibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What was the Government of Rwanda prepared to do to protect the<BR>people in Zaire? a correspondent asked. Mr. Bakuramutsa replied that the<BR>Government was not weak and would take action if necessary. Rwanda,<BR>however, respected international law. The Government would not allow the<BR>continued killing of its citizens and of those people who identified<BR>themselves with Rwanda. It could take action to defend its people in the<BR>same way that France defended its own language.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - Following is a statement issued by the United<BR>Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) on May 23:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African economy experienced its highest annual growth rate since<BR>the beginning of the decade in 1995, with the overall gross domestic<BR>product (GDP) climbing by 2.3 per cent during the year compared to 2.1<BR>per cent in 1994 and 0.7 per cent in 1993, according to the &quot;Report on<BR>the Economic and Social Situation in Africa, 1996&quot; issued by the<BR>Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a further positive confirmation of the recovery that has<BR>taken place in Africa in recent years,&quot; said the report, which was<BR>released earlier this month. Only three African countries experienced<BR>negative growth in 1995 compared to 14 the previous year; eight<BR>countries recorded 6 per cent growth compared to two in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The improving economic situation also bodes well for the<BR>implementation of the unprecedented United Nations System-Wide<BR>Initiative on Africa, a 10- year, $25 billion endeavour aimed at<BR>ensuring basic education, improved health services delivery and food<BR>security on the continent, among other objectives. The Initiative, which<BR>was the result of a consensus between African governments and their<BR>development partners on how to meet the continent's major challenges,<BR>was launched in March by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and<BR>United Nations agency heads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another indication of the positive economic upturn was that the<BR>region's 33 least developed countries also recorded a positive economic<BR>performance for the first time since 1992, with total GDP increasing to<BR>2.4 per cent in 1995 compared to -2.4 per cent and -1.6 per cent in 1993<BR>and 1994, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although these average growth rates for the continent mask variations<BR>in country and sub-regional performances, the report noted that for the<BR>first time since the 1970s numerous national economies are now growing<BR>faster than their populations. This is &quot;a welcome sign that overall<BR>growth trends in Africa are beginning to gather momentum towards the<BR>recovery evident in the global economy&quot;, the report said. Nineteen<BR>countries (five in southern Africa and eight in eastern Africa)<BR>experienced GDP growth in excess of Africa's current 2.9 per cent<BR>population growth rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even with the recovery in GDP growth rates, the continent's share<BR>of aggregate world trade and output remains far below its percentage of<BR>world population. Africa's share in world trade has fallen steadily over<BR>the years, from 5 per cent in 1980 to 3.1 per cent in 1990, to 2.3 per<BR>cent in 1995, and 2.2 per cent in 1995. The decline of Africa's<BR>percentage in the trade of developing countries as a whole has been even<BR>more dramatic: from 14.9 per cent in 1980, to 10.9 per cent in 1990, and<BR>6.4 per cent in 1995. Compared with the 1980s, Africa's GDP in the 1990s<BR>has accounted for less and less of the global GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Africa's share of the world's population is on the<BR>increase: it reached an estimated 12 per cent in 1995. Therefore, the<BR>continent's overall GDP growth rate has yet to keep pace with its<BR>population growth rate. Given a population growth rate of 2.3 per cent<BR>in 1995, average per capita income actually declined 0.6 per cent for<BR>the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report noted that in addition to the problem of a rapidly growing<BR>population, many of the factors responsible for the weak economic<BR>performance in Africa over the years are still present. Nevertheless,<BR>the prospects of the continent emerging from these problems and<BR>challenges are better than ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Africa is no longer an undifferentiated mass of poorly performing<BR>economies&quot;, the report said. &quot;Differences among individual African<BR>countries and groups of countries with the potential for rapid growth<BR>and socio-economic transformation have persisted, but current<BR>indications are that the capacity of African societies and economies for<BR>real and sustained growth are being increasingly realized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The eight countries with the most impressive GDP growth rates in 1995<BR>were Burkina Faso (6 per cent), Cote d'Ivoire (6.6 per cent), Ghana (6.9<BR>per cent), Kenya (6.1 per cent), Malawi (6.2 per cent), Mali (6 per<BR>cent), Togo (6.7 per cent) and Tunisia (6.7 per cent), the report said.<BR>The recovery in GDP growth was related mainly to a strong performance by<BR>the manufacturing sector and a modest rebound by the mining sector, the<BR>report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manufacturing sector recorded a positive growth rate of 4.2 per<BR>cent in value added in 1995, mainly because of the availability of<BR>better input supplies and improvements in the importation of raw<BR>materials for agro-allied industries. Capacity utilization, encouraged<BR>by remedial policy measures such as the rationalization of industries<BR>under structural adjustment programmes, was a main contributor to the<BR>positive growth, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Extensive reforms in the mining sector over recent years have lead to<BR>increased exploration and mining investment in several countries, the<BR>report noted. But the overall improvements in the mining sector were<BR>related to an almost 20 per cent increase in mineral and metal ore<BR>prices and a 7.9 per cent increase in the oil sector. Copper prices were<BR>27.3 per cent higher in 1995 than in 1994, while prices of other<BR>minerals and metal ores also increased: of nickel (30 per cent),<BR>aluminum (22.3 per cent), cobalt (19.9 per cent), lead (14.6 per cent)<BR>and iron ore (6 per cent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Growth in the agricultural sector -- the traditional mainstay of most<BR>African economies -- was lacklustre. According to the Food and<BR>Agriculture Organization (FAO), the incidence of drought in the third<BR>quarter of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995 precipitated famine<BR>conditions that affected some 10 countries in the northern, eastern and<BR>southern subregions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, agricultural output in the region stagnated. There was a<BR>drastic reduction in per capita agricultural output in some subregions,<BR>with the growth rate decreasing from 4.2 per cent in 1994 to 1.5 per<BR>cent in 1995. The loss was more pronounced in the northern, southern and<BR>eastern subregions than elsewhere. The southern sub-region registered a<BR>negative 7 per cent growth rate for 1995, while the eastern subregion<BR>recorded a negative 3 per cent. West Africa performed better, but its<BR>agricultural growth rate still fell from 5.8 per cent in 1994 to 4.2 per<BR>cent in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's external trade benefitted from price increases for primary<BR>commodities, which according to ECA provisional estimates boosted export<BR>earnings by 1.1 per cent in 1995 compared to a 4.9 per cent increase in<BR>1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Following is a news release from the Truth And<BR>Reconciliation Commission dated May 24:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Human Rights Violations Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation<BR>Commission will seek to clarify the rights of alleged perpetrators of<BR>human rights violations after two divisions of the Supreme Court<BR>expressed conflicting opinions on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A meeting of the committee, held in Johannesburg today, resolved to<BR>take legal steps to resolve differences over how much notice alleged<BR>perpetrators have to be given if victims want to name them at commission<BR>hearings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pending clarification being obtained, the committee adopted<BR>procedures aimed at giving persons proper, reasonable and timeous notice<BR>of hearings if evidence detrimentally implicating them is heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape Supreme Court last month ordered the commission to give<BR>&quot;proper, reasonable and timeous notice&quot;. However, in a judgment on<BR>another matter in Port Elizabeth this week, the South Eastern Cape<BR>Division of the Supreme Court disagreed with the Cape Town judgment. Mr<BR>Acting Justice R G Buchanan said he did not believe prior notice need be<BR>given to someone detrimentally implicated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Human Rights Violations Committee also took note of today's order<BR>from the Cape Supreme Court requiring that it should give two retired<BR>police officers at least 30 days' notice of a hearing at which they<BR>would be named. The committee will abide by the ruling. It will,<BR>however, oppose the confirmation of the order when the court hears full<BR>argument on the matter on June 13. It will also contest the allegation<BR>that it acted in contempt of last month's court order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the text of a letter dated May 23 from<BR>President Clinton to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the<BR>President Pro Tempore of the Senate concerning deployment of Marines to<BR>the Central African Republic:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 19, 1996, heavy fighting broke out between government forces<BR>and mutinous troops in the capital city of Bangui, Central African<BR>Republic.  Early reports suggested that some 200-500 renegade soldiers<BR>were firing weapons, including rockets and artillery, and that they had<BR>called for troops from outside the capital to join them in the mutiny.<BR>During the fighting, prison guards reportedly abandoned their posts and<BR>prisoners were observed loitering around the prison.  Although neither<BR>the American Embassy nor American citizens have been directly targeted,<BR>heavy fighting has been reported around the American Embassy, which has<BR>sustained some damage from stray rounds.  At one point, government<BR>forces indicated an intention to assault a rebel stronghold very near<BR>the Embassy, but were dissuaded by the Ambassador.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 20, due to the rapidly deteriorating security situation and<BR>the resultant threat to American citizens and the Embassy, I ordered<BR>the deployment of U.S. military personnel to provide enhanced security<BR>for the American Embassy in Bangui and to conduct the evacuation from<BR>the Central African Republic of private U.S. citizens and certain U.S.<BR>Government employees.  Approximately 32 U.S. Marines entered the capital<BR>city in the early morning hours on May 21 and immediately took up<BR>positions in and around the American Embassy compound.  They also<BR>deployed to the international airport in order to assist in processing<BR>evacuees and act as liaison with French military forces already<BR>positioned there.  Evacuation operations began later that day, involving<BR>a U.S. KC-130 cargo aircraft operating into Yaounde, Cameroon.  Further<BR>evacuation flights are planned.  Additional U.S. forces may also be<BR>deployed in order to provide a means of safe passage for evacuees to the<BR>airport and to provide additional security at the American Embassy if<BR>required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Marines involved in this operation are from the Marine<BR>Expeditionary Unit currently operating off Liberia.  Although U.S.<BR>forces are equipped and prepared to defend American lives and property,<BR>I do not anticipate that they will become involved in hostilities.  U.S.<BR>forces will redeploy as soon as evacuation operations are complete and<BR>enhanced security at the American Embassy is no longer required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have taken this action pursuant to my constitutional authority to<BR>conduct the foreign relations of the United States and as Commander in<BR>Chief and Chief Executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress<BR>fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution. I appreciate<BR>the support of the Congress in this action to protect American citizens<BR>and the American Embassy in Bangui.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - &quot;Suddenly there were gun-shot sounds in the air, houses<BR>blazed away madly, people screamed in pain, we too took off...&quot; narrated<BR>42-year- old Cleophas Budi to a hushed audience of media practitioners<BR>and Non-Governmental Organisations' personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budi's trembling voice went on; &quot;As I ran past Carol, my six-year old<BR>daughter, it occurred to me that I should turn round and pick her...&quot;<BR>But he never picked Carol up and never saw her alive again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budi, who sustained a deep sword-cut that runs from his right eye<BR>brow to the nape of his neck is also semi-paralysed on the left side of<BR>his body. This makes him walk with a painful jerky ungainly gait.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cleophas Budi was narrating his experience through the infamous<BR>ethnic violence that ravaged sections of Kenya during the run-up to the<BR>first multi-party elections in 1992, and the period immediately after<BR>the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ethnic clashes, largely blamed on the government in its attempt<BR>to discredit multi-partism, were responsible for the death of over 1,500<BR>people, the displacement of 56,000 others and the destruction of<BR>property estimated at hundreds of millions of shillings; according to a<BR>September 1992 parliamentary select committee report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The May 17 to 20 meeting, financed by the Kenyan National Council of<BR>Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and coordinated by Peace-Net was<BR>convened to discuss the Kenyan media coverage of conflicts. Peace-net is<BR>a peace and development networking group of the National Council of NGOs<BR>set up in September 1993 as a response to ethnic violence which rocked<BR>parts of the country from October 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the Limuru workshop, some 30 kilometres west of Nairobi,<BR>renowned journalist and lecturer in mass communication at Tangaza<BR>College, Nairobi, Fr. Renato Kizito said, &quot;it is tragic that violenceFr.  Kizito noted that &quot;not only are the media giving more room to<BR>based journalism abounds.&quot;<BR>violence, not only have they nourished the growing atmosphere of<BR>violence in the world, they have also become more violent themselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fr. Kizito called for united effort by socially-responsible<BR>communicators to end stereotypes that often result in violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a section of the local press later absolved the local mass<BR>media and their scribes from actions that promote violence in the<BR>country. Writing in its May 20 editorial page, The Daily Nation, Kenya's<BR>mass circulation daily commented;&quot;... this concern about the violence<BR>and rot in our society is justifiable, but blaming the media for it is<BR>failing to see the underlying factors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Kenyans affected by the bloody ethnic clashes which rocked parts<BR>of the country believe that the government and its various<BR>administrative organs deliberately orchestrated ethnic violence, fanned<BR>it out and are now unwilling to decisively resettle displaced victims of<BR>the violence. To date, most of the victims have not been resettled,<BR>leave alone being compensated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The underlying factors&quot; referred to by the Daily Nation's editorial<BR>include what most groups working in the realm of peace and<BR>reconciliation in the affected areas see as &quot;political unwillingness&quot; to<BR>resolve what is now referred to as &quot;the ethnic clash problem,&quot;<BR>conclusively raising fears of renewed ethnic bloodletting come next<BR>general election scheduled for 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an earlier Peace-Net meeting of March 27 to 28 the Chief Executive<BR>Officer of the NGO Council, Mr. Murtaza Jaffer, had warned; &quot;Let us make<BR>no mistakes about it, the level of violence ... political and otherwise<BR>... appears to escalate as we approach the 1997 election year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date the government has not attempted to give a rational<BR>explanation of the causes of the late 1991 to 1993 bloody ethnic<BR>conflicts which initially seemed like simple land disputes between the<BR>Kalenjin and the Kikuyu, Luo and Luhya ethnic groups living mainly in<BR>the Rift Valley and Western Provinces of the country, preferring to<BR>blame opposition parties for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lamenting about this tendency, a participant in the seminar, Mr.<BR>Wanyama Masinde, a journalist and editor of Clashes Update, a National<BR>Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK) publication on local ethnic clashes,<BR>opposed the &quot;blaming of the ethnic clashes problem on the opposition<BR>parties as it runs across the whole administrative structure.&quot; This<BR>tendency, he added, will only worsen the situation rather than improve<BR>on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But perhaps what heightens the fear of renewed ethnic violence most<BR>is, according to one participant, &quot;a feeling of being cheated, a feeling<BR>of lack of justice by most victims who are still displaced and<BR>traumatised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As we preach peace we should also preach justice. Most victims of<BR>the ethnic bloodletting are still very traumatised and are asking<BR>questions which someone must answer. The victims are asking, who is<BR>going to give me my house? Who is going to give me my property? Who is<BR>going to give me my children? Someone must answer these disturbing<BR>questions. Someone must be responsible for these crimes. We cannot just<BR>talk of peace and reconciliation without incorporating justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps Cleophas Budi's experience on that dreadful drizzly evening<BR>at Kapsokwony, about 500 kilometres west of Nairobi (on the slopes of<BR>Mount Elgon) best illustrates this view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budi explained that he regained consciousness several weeks later but<BR>could not recognise the strange environment that was Kenyatta National<BR>Hospital, Nairobi where he had been flown by &quot;good samaritans.&quot; &quot;I thank<BR>God because I am one of the lucky ones. I never thought I could live<BR>again. It was like resurrecting from the world of the dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his two years of hospitalization, Budi underwent several<BR>operations which included a replacement of part of his skull with an<BR>artificial bone flap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today he has to live on drugs just so as to maintain his balance. He<BR>has lost ability to work with his left hand and walks with difficulty.<BR>&quot;It is very very difficult for me,&quot; he told this writer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the shock that met him after leaving hospital made him shed<BR>bitter tears of helplessness. &quot;I cry a lot, especially at night,&quot; Mr.<BR>Budi said. Carol, his three year old daughter had been stabbed to death<BR>on the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> day her father's skull was crushed. His nine acre piece of land had<BR>been claimed by the &quot;warriors,&quot; nine head of cattle shot to death and<BR>his house and documents razed to ashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nobody has been charged for the loss suffered by the Budis. Together<BR>with his wife and two teenage daughters, Budi now lives in a dilapidated<BR>grass shack in his original homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the dynamics of rebuilding peace, Ret. Major John Seii<BR>told the seminar that &quot;in the process of rebuilding peace, we discover<BR>that there are unwilling partners. In peace building, there is nothing<BR>known as the way,&quot; he said. We have to pool together ideas and use them<BR>collectively in the process of peace searching, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such organs as the church, fora like workshops, intermarriages,<BR>responsible community leaders and the mass media should be used to<BR>foster peace and reconciliation, he suggested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observed one participant, &quot;We are photocopying ideas which have<BR>failed in Rwanda, Somalia and Bosnia. Some are practical locally. We<BR>should also look for original conflict resolving practices from our own<BR>cultures. There in lies a solution to some local conflicts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like millions of women throughout the developing world who support<BR>themselves and their families through small manufacturing businesses and<BR>petty trade activities, Roselyn Mungai's two year-old retail tyre<BR>business in Nairobi still has its share of hiccups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Businesswomen face so many obstacles, it is a wonder that we manage<BR>to exist at all,&quot; says the 38-year old single mother of two who gave up<BR>a career as an accountant to concentrate on business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM),<BR>almost all low-income women are economically active and women are major<BR>contributors to the global economy and to the survival and well-being of<BR>households, communities and national.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet they lack access to the economic means to increase the output of<BR>their labour and to claim the benefits that result from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIFEM identifies credit, savings and other financial services as one<BR>of the critical and most direct tools for putting resources into the<BR>hands of rural and urban poor women producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Mungai did what many Kenyan women do. Rather than seek the<BR>services of private money-lenders known as &quot;shylocks&quot; (whose interest<BR>rates are exorbitant), she sought the support of friends and<BR>acquaintances in a similar predicament and formed a welfare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> group to raise funds and loan one another on a rotational basis to<BR>support their businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group has since been able to access credit amounting to Kshs.1<BR>million (about US dollars 17,860) since 1994 from the Kenya Women's<BR>Finance Trust (KWFT), a Kenyan NGO that supports the economic<BR>empowerment of women who are already in economically viable businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to KWFT's managing director, Dr. Jennifer Riria-Ouko, over<BR>3,000 loans have been disbursed to women in economically viable<BR>businesses since 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We target women in micro, small and medium enterprises, assisting<BR>those who would otherwise have no access to credit, whereas banks tend<BR>to look at entrepreneurs who will survive,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commercial lending institutions require that borrowers have a stable<BR>source of income out of which the principal and interest on loans can be<BR>paid according to the agreed terms. However, the incomes of many self&quot;The formal financial system is difficult to penetrate,&quot; says Dr.<BR>employed women tend to be precarious.<BR>Riria-Ouko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another stumbling block for women entrepreneurs seeking credit from<BR>commercial lending institutions is that lenders prefer dealing with<BR>large loans in small numbers to minimise administration costs, whereas a<BR>large number of small loans are needed to serve the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the Trust's interest rates are at par with the current<BR>market rates, clients have been able to sustain a 98 per cent repayment<BR>rate on loans and to diversify their enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is proof that women are credit worthy,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite the intervention of KWFT and agencies committed to the<BR>economic empowerment of women, the barriers which make life next to<BR>impossible for women struggling in the informal sector persist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Mungai lists illiteracy and the yawning information gap as a<BR>hindrance to the advancement of women in business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is important to be informed. Kenyan women may be a hardworking<BR>lot but they are not always well informed about what they are venturing<BR>into,&quot; she says. Moreso at a time when the high levels of unemployment<BR>and cut-backs in public sector employment leave women vulnerable to<BR>retrenchment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She adds that she is interested in venturing beyond the Kenyan border<BR>into Uganda and Tanzania, but is intimidated by the bureaucracy<BR>involved, the taxes and lack of adequate information on the import&quot;Government customs officers need to set up a forum for dialogue with<BR>export market.<BR>businesswomen. We need education on conducting our businesses legally,<BR>and more information on the line dividing a legitimate transfer of goods<BR>across the border and smuggling.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)<BR>pocket reference publication, Gender in Africa - the Issues, the Facts,<BR>improved access to credit for women results in multiple social benefits,<BR>such as better educated children, poverty alleviation and increased<BR>productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Credit is also important to assist women take advantage of<BR>opportunities for self employment because their informal sector<BR>enterprises may develop to become part of the formal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Globally, the number of rural women living in absolute poverty has<BR>risen by 50 per cent and the feminisation of poverty is growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation is worsened by the globalisation of the economy,<BR>compounding the effects of gender bias which in various forms prevents<BR>women from obtaining the education, training and health services, child<BR>care and legal status to escape their poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIFEM prescribes access to and control over economic resources,<BR>assets and opportunities so that women may benefit from them on a<BR>sustainable and long-term basis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Last February, the National Council of Churches of Kenya<BR>(NCCK) announced that all its members should pursue non-partisan<BR>politics as Kenyans prepare for the 1997 general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The umbrella body, which leads more than 15 million Protestants,<BR>representing over 70 per cent of Kenya's Christian population, aims to<BR>reclaim the autonomy of the global church acting within its domain as a<BR>social pacifist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Formed originally as the Christian Council of Kenya in 1943, the NCCK<BR>represents 47 member churches and 10 para-church organisations.<BR>According to the chairman, Bishop Zablon Nthamburi, the umbrella council<BR>of churches is the second largest church body of its kind in the world Among its goals stated in its mission statement, the NCCK aims to<BR>and the largest in Africa.<BR>&quot;strive to be a model and living witness of Christian faith to member<BR>churches and the society.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Issuing the directive to be non-partisan during the NCCK Round Table<BR>Conference held at the Limuru Conference and Training Centre in<BR>February, Bishop Nthamburi said the church - a consistent if<BR>controversial watchdog of the government even before the multi-party era<BR>when it was christened the &quot;unofficial opposition&quot; and a voice of the<BR>voiceless - has seen the light at the end of the murky political tunnel,<BR>which can only be arrived at by, in his words; &quot;the churches' obligation<BR>to educate voters on their socio-political rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council chairman describes the approach by the body as a &quot;newcountry by disseminating civic, voter education as well as information<BR>found prophetic role in a changing world. &quot;It will play it out in the<BR>on constitutional rights, freedoms and obligations of the individual and<BR>to campaign for levelling of the landscape for all parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We intend to build a viable society politically, economically and<BR>socially by teaching the rights of a voter, human rights as well as<BR>constitutional rights of a citizen and women rights. This is mainly in<BR>preparation for the forthcoming election process but we will later focus<BR>on land rights, poverty and the education system,&quot; said Nthamburi in a<BR>recent interview with this writer. He notes that such rights must be<BR>agitated for actively as &quot;they will not be given on a silver platter by<BR>President Daniel arap Moi's government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed this has become the council's new-found faith that Kenya's<BR>political salvation lies in empowering voters and lobbying for<BR>meaningful constitutional changes to create a level playing field for<BR>all political parties. This reflection is well presented in a document<BR>entitled, Kenya, Our Common Future: Constitutional and Electoral Reform,<BR>which was first unveiled on May 4, 1995 at the Limuru Centre where<BR>clergy, lawyers, diplomats and non-governmental organisations met at the<BR>invitation of NCCK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCCK Executive Committee has formally approved the document as a<BR>blueprint to mark the boundaries of its political involvement. The<BR>chairman who is also the presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church in<BR>Kenya, says in a multi-party era, a church may have a leader and<BR>congregation members who follow different parties, thus the need to<BR>clearly distinguish the NCCK as non-partisan in intent and purpose so as<BR>not to divide the flock. It is for this reason (church divisions) and<BR>political disillusionment with the fragmented opposition parties that<BR>the erstwhile oppositionist body now wants a hands-off approach to<BR>politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is only last year that the Rev. Sammy Chepkwony of the Eldoret<BR>Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) Diocese, Rift Valley Province,<BR>teamed up with Rev. John Wango of the Nambale diocese to form the rival<BR>Regional Fellowship Churches of Kenya (RFCK), registered on July 28, for<BR>reasons, among others, that &quot;the NCCK has become too political.&quot; The<BR>RFCK which touted itself on inception as non- partisan politically has a<BR>membership of 40 churches, including three CPK dioceses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the issue of a disjointed opposition in Kenya, Nthamburi regrets<BR>that politicians have failed to give the people an alternative agenda<BR>and instead concentrated on jostling for leadership and fractious<BR>wrangles. &quot;The church is disappointed with the opposition's inability to<BR>sell their agenda to the public as they are just engaged in squabbles<BR>and shouting,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyans recall the clout that the NCCK wielded in its political<BR>pronouncements and the respect with which the government handled its<BR>criticism in the early 90s. It is this involvement that earned the<BR>council the label and following of an unofficial opposition party and<BR>one of its members, the more than two million strong (Anglican) Church<BR>of the Province of Kenya (CPK), was tagged &quot;Church of the Politics of<BR>Kenya&quot; by the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moses Shiribwa, a project assistant says the civic education<BR>programme kicked off in 1991 to lead voters by equipping them to read<BR>the various political party manifestos and interpret them. &quot;However, the<BR>electors were overtaken by the euphoria of the new multi-party system<BR>and ended up voting on ethnic lines and personalities,&quot; he laments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, he says, the church has followed up with several training<BR>seminars for trainers, who then train their various congregations<BR>countrywide. So far, says Shiribwa, over 4,000 such trainers have<BR>received civic training and based on the multiplier effect on their<BR>congregations, it is estimated that more than 1 million church-goers are<BR>receiving similar education, given that each trains about 300 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is only in hostile areas like Baringo or Elgeyo-Marakwet and the<BR>so-called KANU zone in the Rift Valley Province that we are yet to<BR>penetrate, not to mention arid areas like Garrisa and Isiolo in North<BR>Eastern Province,&quot; he says. However, this impasse has been overcome by<BR>transporting people from these areas to as far as Taita Taveta and<BR>Wundanyi in the Coast Province, to train them in what have now become<BR>known as inter-district seminars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The training seminars are addressed by a cross section of experts<BR>among them lawyers, political scientists, educationists, human rights<BR>activists and NCCK's own line-up which includes such outspoken clergy as<BR>Rev. Dr. Timothy Njoya of the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA)<BR>and Rev. Japheth Gathaka, the former director of the council's Justice<BR>and Peace Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lectures mainly address issues dealing with the rights of a<BR>citizen and his/her role in a multi-party democracy. The church body has<BR>also sponsored the production of several books on this subject to be<BR>given free to learners. Some of the titles include Dr. Nick Wanjohi's<BR>Multi-party electoral process in Kenya.  His more recent, Challenge of<BR>Democratic Governance, states in chapter 7; &quot;The end of every multigreat challenge to all - Kenyan citizens have no option but to take a<BR>party election in Africa today presents great satisfaction to many and a<BR>noble but demanding responsibility to participate in the governance of<BR>their country. Ignoring this role may shift back the gear which was put<BR>in place in 1992.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the rural areas, the NCCK plans to sensitise would-be voters on<BR>the importance of elections, voter registration and voting rights by<BR>simplifying the technical or legal jargon which is also translated into<BR>the respective vernaculars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A two-day workshop held at the Limuru Centre at the close of last<BR>year as a trial run for using the stage to reach the youth with the<BR>democratisation message, was hailed as &quot;a great idea that should have<BR>caught on long ago, particularly in the light of the participatory<BR>nature of theatre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shiribwa says plays and music are effectively used in rural markets<BR>and churches to portray either political parties, or election procedures<BR>of co-operative societies. These usually generate discussions thereafter<BR>and the audience can contribute their views. The annual budget for the<BR>civic education programme is Kshs. 19 million (US dollars 333,000)<BR>partly donated by church donors in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As far back as 1993, the then NCCK General Secretary Rev. Samuel<BR>Kobia, unveiled plans to particularly counter KANU's monopoly on the<BR>electronic media scene by establishing an independent source of news as<BR>well as airing civic education programmes. It was revealed then that<BR>donors to finance the project were being sought, but the greater<BR>hindrance has been the government's delay, otherwise read as refusal to<BR>licence locally based private stations. Media sources here say there are<BR>over 60 applicants awaiting approval to operate broadcast stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We might be the last ones to get the licence because of the<BR>government's fear of critical media, for we are still seen as the<BR>opposition in disguise,&quot; says Nthamburi, noting that all should be given<BR>a chance now that the airwaves have formally been liberalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCCK recommends constitutional change such as the introduction of<BR>the office of prime minister which will relegate the presidency to a<BR>non-executive one, &quot;in order to ensure a clear separation of power<BR>between the government and the political party in office.&quot; Accordingly,<BR>the president is expected to be above party politics, while the prime<BR>minister should be a nominee of the party in leadership, but not the<BR>head of such a party. In a move akin to that in South Africa, the<BR>Christian council wants a constitutional provision to permit the<BR>formation of a coalition government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We agree the Constitution does not change overnight. It is a process<BR>you cannot just switch on and off. It has to be participatory and based<BR>on informed judgement,&quot; said current General Secretary Rev. Mutava<BR>Musyimi at the Limuru conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the NCCK blueprint the civic education and<BR>constitutional change process should be done eight months before the<BR>elections to allow for voter education and logistical planning.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum - Sudan has created a commission to investigate claims of<BR>slave dealing in the south of the country, amid charges of continued<BR>human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Minister Abdel Basit Sabdarat formed the panel on May 19, to<BR>&quot;look into reports by UN Human Rights rapporteur Gasper Biro concerning<BR>the existence of slavery and forced disappearances in Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission head, Ali Ahmed al-Nasri was reported saying the panel<BR>would tour the country and submit a report in August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Due to the ongoing war in the south, many people have disappeared or<BR>been abducted by rebels,&quot; Nasri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Biro said in his report in April that the existence of slavery in<BR>Sudan was &quot;no longer debatable,&quot; warning of &quot;an alarming increase in the<BR>number of reports on cases of slavery, servitude, slave trade and forced<BR>labour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The abuses are concentrated in the south where 1.2 million people<BR>have died since 1983, in a civil war between the mostly Muslim north and<BR>rebels from the mostly Christian and animist south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The abduction of southern civilians, men, women and children has<BR>become a way of conducting the war,&quot; Biro's report noted, slamming the<BR>&quot;total passivity of the government&quot; as &quot;tacit political approval of<BR>slavery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite efforts to improve its human rights standing among the<BR>international community, the London-based human rights watchdog Amnesty<BR>International has charged that Sudan, whose current government seized<BR>power in a 1989 military coup, continued to violate human rights,<BR>including arbitrary killings, abduction of children and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suspected government opponents are subjected to ill treatment and<BR>incommunicado detention, the human rights organisation said in a<BR>statement released on May 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While Sudan's ambassadors are busy telling the United Nations that<BR>violations do not occur, the government's security forces are rounding<BR>up suspected opponents in the capital and attacking civilian targets in<BR>the war zones of the south, deliberately killing adults and forcibly<BR>abducting children as a tactic of war,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elections were held last March, ostensibly to move from a military to<BR>a civilian government, but the polls, boycotted by the opposition, &quot;have<BR>not made any difference to who holds power or to systematic repression<BR>as a method of securing control,&quot; Amnesty said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It said the abduction of children by government forces and allied<BR>militia &quot;is a growing feature of the civil war which began in 1983,&quot;<BR>when the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) took up arms to end<BR>domination of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Arabised,<BR>Muslim north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the start of the civil war, more than a million people have<BR>been killed and millions others either displaced locally or forced to<BR>flee into exile in neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Amnesty claimed on May 23 that some of the children affected by<BR>the war were held for ransom, some were taken into &quot;domestic slavery,&quot;<BR>and others &quot;ended up in government schools run like armed camps, where<BR>some children have been shot while trying to escape.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paris - Algerian Muslim extremists say they killed seven French monks<BR>kidnapped in Algeria two months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a communique, a copy of which was released here, the Armed Islamic<BR>Group (GIA) said: &quot;We cut the throats of the seven monks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement which bore the number 44 and the usual signature of the<BR>fundamentalist GIA said the monks had been killed on May 21, and<BR>justified the killings by accusing the French government of not wanting<BR>to negotiate with it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French Foreign Ministry said if the killings by the GIA were<BR>confirmed, all French people would react with &quot;amazement, indignation<BR>and condemnation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GIA has been one of the most radical groups fighting the Algerian<BR>government since it annulled legislative elections in January 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The monks were kidnapped on March 27 from their isolated monastery at<BR>Tibehirine, 100 kilometres south-west of Algiers, and in a communique<BR>dated April 18 and addressed to &quot;France and its President Jacques<BR>Chirac,&quot; the GIA threatened to &quot;cut the throats&quot; of the monks unless the<BR>group's members detained in France were released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are offering to exchange your prisoners for ours and we have a<BR>precise list of names, and we will name for now only brother Abdel<BR>Khaleq al-Ayayda,&quot; the earlier communique stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the communique, the GIA, the most hardline of armed fundamentalist<BR>groups fighting the Algerian authorities, had said the Trappist monks<BR>were &quot;still alive and in good health,&quot; the international ArabicThe communique, signed by GIA head Abou Abdel Rahmane Amine (alias<BR>language paper, Al-Hayat said.<BR>Jamel Zitouni), claimed responsibility &quot;20 days after the kidnapping to<BR>show the entire world that the infidels (the Algerian security forces)<BR>are incapable of defending themselves and even less capable of<BR>protecting others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-page GIA statement said three other missionaries seized in<BR>the Medea region were also still alive, but that ten Algerian soldiers<BR>were killed while searching for the French monks in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hardline statement, issued in the Egyptian capital, Cairo on<BR>April 26, stipulated there would be &quot;no dialogue, no truce and no<BR>reconciliation&quot; with the military-backed authorities in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Al-Hayat also reported that &quot;French and Italian Catholic<BR>authorities...have been in contact with the group which kidnapped the<BR>seven French monks since mid-April.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 12, Father Lois Samson, an official with the Trappist order<BR>in Rome, received word from a colleague who visited Algeria that the<BR>seven monks were still alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 14 in Tunis, Pope John Paul II made a plea for the release<BR>of the monks, some of whom are elderly and three of whom are in fragile<BR>health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 200 alleged Islamic fundamentalists are being held in<BR>France awaiting trial on terrorism-related charges involving a bombing<BR>campaign last year, believed to have been inspired by the GIA or<BR>logistical support and arms smuggling networks for the GIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judicial sources said it would be difficult to establish which of the<BR>200 were GIA members unless the organisation provided a list of those it<BR>wanted exchanged for the seven monks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed Islamic groups have been fighting the military-backed Algiers<BR>regime since the government cancelled a second round of elections in<BR>January 1992. The violence has left up to 50,000 people dead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The year 1996 is a celebration period for the Catholic<BR>Order of Maryknoll Fathers (Society). It marks the 50th anniversary of<BR>the society's pastoral work among Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> William Collins, Albert Good, Louis Bayless and Joseph Brannigan, the<BR>first four missionaries of this congregation, arrived in Musoma,<BR>Tanzania in August 1946.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After nearly two months of their journey that began in New York,<BR>USA, the four arrived in Musoma, Tanzania on October 23. This was to<BR>become the beginning of their missionary work on the African continent,&quot;<BR>explains a brochure put out to mark the golden jubilee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with APS here on May 22, Rev. Fr. Joseph Healey, the<BR>society's social communications coordinator for Tanzania, said the<BR>jubilee year is being marked in series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We organised a regional symposium on &quot;Mission&quot; in Nairobi between<BR>January 9 and 11. We marked it in Musoma (Tanzania) on May 17, at<BR>Nyegina parish in Musoma area on May 19, and we intend to end the<BR>celebrations in Shinyanga on October 15,&quot; said Fr. Healey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Fr. Healey, there are 94 Maryknoll priests currently<BR>serving the Catholic church in Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The majority, 38, are in Tanzania and 29 in Kenya,&quot; says Fr. Healey.<BR>In Tanzania, for example, they serve in eight Catholic dioceses namely<BR>Dar es Salaam, Iringa, Geita, Musoma, Mwanza, Rulenge, Shinyanga and<BR>Singida. In Kenya, the Maryknoll are working in the dioceses of Nairobi,<BR>Machakos and Garissa. There are two Maryknoll priests in Ethiopia, while<BR>Egypt has one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But in all they are scattered in different professional areas such<BR>as medicine, teaching and communications both within and outside<BR>pastoral areas,&quot; Fr. Healey elaborated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from ordained priests, the Maryknoll order also has brothers,<BR>sisters and lay missionaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, some 43 Maryknoll sisters serve the Catholic church in<BR>Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked what he sees as future challenges for the society in the years<BR>ahead, Fr. Healey mentioned the growing urbanization process being<BR>experienced by many countries on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He singled out single mothers and erosion of African values as<BR>possible outcomes of this process, whose effects on the lives of the<BR>African people will be great.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also said the future work of the society, both in Africa and<BR>elsewhere is likely to be affected by a new phenomenon, as religious<BR>vocation among young Americans is not growing fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unlike in the past, young Americans are no longer attracted by<BR>religious life as it happened before,&quot; says Healey. The average age of<BR>most of the Maryknollers currently serving the Church in Africa is soon<BR>going to be 60 years -- meaning that the bodily energy will have some<BR>effects on their priestly life,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike other religious orders, the Maryknoll society does not train<BR>African priests for service. &quot;We are a national missionary society,<BR>hence we do not train local people for our society,&quot; Fr. Healey<BR>explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he noted that the missionaries do a lot of work for the church,<BR>towards promoting various religious vocations among the local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Musoma celebrations (May 17) whose climax was a holy<BR>eucharist, retired Tanzanian Cardinal Laurent Rugambwa hailed the<BR>Maryknoll missionaries for their pastoral contribution to the growth of<BR>Christianity in Africa and Tanzania in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are here to mark yet another milestone of the pastoral growth<BR>among the African people. For the last 50 years, the Maryknoll<BR>missionaries have made their own contribution towards that goal. We must<BR>thank them dearly for this,&quot; he told a huge congregation which included<BR>the African regional superior for the Maryknoll society in Tanzania,<BR>Rev. Fr. John Sivalon and the overall superior general for the society,<BR>Rev. Fr. Kenneth Thesing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address, Rev. Fr. Thesing reminded the congregation that &quot;the<BR>commemoration of 50 years of the pastoral work of Maryknoll missionaries<BR>among African people was not the end of the journey, but the beginning<BR>of yet another pastoral journey.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would like to assure you that, we intend to continue with the<BR>same spirit in our pastoral commitment,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the society has proposed that its 1996 Mission Award be<BR>given to the Nairobi-based ecumenical movement, People for Peace in<BR>Africa, in recognition of its efforts towards peace-keeping and<BR>reconciliation in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Fr. Healey, the organization has been proposed partly<BR>because, &quot;since its founding in 1989, it has facilitated peace talks<BR>between warring factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement Army<BR>(SPLM/A), arranged and facilitated meetings for rival Somali factions in<BR>the Kenyan capital, and helped a group of young Somali journalists<BR>launch a reconciliation and peace journal for Somali communities in<BR>Somalia and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People for Peace has also responded to the victims of &quot;ethnic<BR>clashes&quot; in Kenya, especially through workshops organized throughout the<BR>country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has also conducted reconciliation workshops for Rwandan women<BR>leaders from both Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups as well as accompanied<BR>the Nuba people, who are victims of &quot;ethnic genocide in the Sudan,&quot;<BR>according to Fr. Healey, who is also the editor of the Maryknoll<BR>Overview, a regional publication for the society in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Zambian parliament has passed a controversial bill that<BR>amends the constitution to effectively bar former Zambian President<BR>Kenneth Kaunda from contesting elections later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill, overwhelmingly supported by the ruling Movement for Multiwas taken on May 21.<BR>party Democracy (MMD), underwent minor modifications when the final vote</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most controversial clause says both parents of a presidential<BR>candidate should be Zambian by birth. This was modified to add the words<BR>&quot;or descent&quot; and the stipulation that the presidential aspirant should<BR>have lived in Zambia for 20 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former president has therefore been technically disqualified to<BR>stand in the elections, which must be held by November, as his parents<BR>came from Malawi at the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, now 72, ruled Zambia for nearly three decades from<BR>independence from Britain in 1964, and has vowed to break the law if he<BR>is barred from standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprisingly, almost all Members of Parliament for the opposition<BR>United National Independence Party (UNIP) -- who boycotted the debate<BR>last week were in the house and participated actively in deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP, the country's largest opposition party, walked out of the House<BR>throughout the earlier debates in protest against the citizenship clause<BR>and the ruling party's failure to address other pertinent political<BR>problems in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Fredrick Chiluba is expected to sign the constitutional<BR>amendment bill within 21 days before it becomes law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The amendment will now pit Chiluba against Kaunda in a direct<BR>collision course, with the former vowing that he will sign it into law<BR>while the latter has threatened that he will organize civil disobedience<BR>throughout Zambia to make the country ungovernable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 9, Chiluba warned that in case Kaunda went ahead with his<BR>disobedience threat, the followers of the former president would be<BR>treated as &quot;lawbreakers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kaunda maintained that he and his followers would &quot;break the law&quot;<BR>until &quot;the prisons are too full to contain us,&quot; and that because<BR>Zambians were hungry and desperate, uncontrollable violence could be<BR>unleashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of whether Kaunda is a &quot;genuine&quot; Zambian has been the<BR>centre of the dispute between the government and Kaunda's opposition<BR>United National Independence Party since the former President announced<BR>last year that he would make a comeback in politics by opposing Chiluba<BR>in the next presidential elections scheduled for later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was born in Zambia to parents who immigrated from neighbouring<BR>Malawi, while the new constitution requires that presidential candidates<BR>must have been born to Zambian parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - An upsurge in wife-battering has been reported throughout<BR>Uganda in the aftermath of the recently concluded presidential elections<BR>won by President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The local press has reported a number of cases where women have been<BR>beaten and invariably intimidated for supporting, actually voting for or<BR>celebrating the victory of a candidate their husbands did not favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one incident, Jesca Kasiri of Nawandyo Iganga District, Eastern<BR>Uganda, was allegedly beaten into coma by her husband, Peter Kolwa,<BR>after she revealed to him she had voted for Museveni. In Mukono<BR>District, middle-aged Karim Lubega of Kikuba Nkima village, is suspected<BR>to have beaten his wife, Rose Namubiru, 40, to death.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In yet another case, Vice-President Dr Specioza Wandira Kazibwe, a<BR>woman herself, was prompted to order the police to arrest one Joseph<BR>Bukenya of Ngogwe village, Bukulula sub-county in Masaka District, about<BR>100 kilometres south-west of here, for allegedly assaulting his wife,<BR>Prossy Nakyanzi, who voted for a candidate he did not support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nakyanzi broke her leg and sustained severe injury on her eyes. The<BR>police were said to have been indifferent prompting the Vice- President<BR>to visit the woman and order for the arrest of Bukenya who was said to<BR>be hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Prossy has pleaded for clemency for her husband with whom<BR>she said she has six children and whose support she feared to lose<BR>should the husband be imprisoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the women's Alert Group for the Uganda Women's Network (UWN), has<BR>petitioned the Government to intervene and put a stop to the<BR>&quot;intimidation and harassment of wives by their husbands and to treat any<BR>such violence as 'serious crime' and not 'domestic dispute&quot;. UWN<BR>comprises several prominent women, women groups and men interested in<BR>the protection and promotion of women's rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Both in the local press and from the districts - for instance<BR>Luweero, Mukono, Kampala and Mpigi - it has been reported that women<BR>have been intimidated in different ways,&quot; said the UWN with &quot;a sense of<BR>great shock and disappointment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a two-page open letter to President Museveni and the Chairman of<BR>the Interim Electoral Commission (IEC) the group said: &quot;Women have been<BR>threatened with withdrawal of family support; they have been beaten,<BR>killed, thrown out of their homes; had their voters' cards grabbed from<BR>them or destroyed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since the presidential elections, women have been accused harassed<BR>and assaulted by different groups for having voted for one or the other<BR>candidate,&quot; the Alert Group added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group urged Government and the IEC to tell all Ugandans that<BR>women's rights are human rights and to re-emphasise the fact that women<BR>have rights as citizens of Uganda. The women also want</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> reassurance that the Government will protect them and their property<BR>during and after elections. They further urged that police should be<BR>called in where there is intimidation harassment and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, the May 17 to 20, 1996 edition of The<BR>Monitor, a local privately-owned newspaper that publishes three times a<BR>week reported that Edward Mizaki, 30, a bicycle mechanic of Arua market<BR>in Arua, West Nile, could eventually lose his wife Betty, 23, to Paul<BR>Drani after Museveni, whom the latter supported, won the presidential<BR>race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two men staked Uganda Shillings 100,000 (US$1000) each and signed<BR>an agreement before local administration officials. But Mizaki who did<BR>not have the money at hand instead offered his wife Betty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials have now pleaded with Drani, 27, to leave Betty alone and<BR>accept instead Uganda Shillings 300,000 (US$3,000). Mizaki was<BR>subsequently allowed some time find the money failure of which he would<BR>forfeit his wife. The Monitor was unable to obtain the views of the<BR>affected wife, Betty Mizaki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile nominations for the parliamentary elections closed here at<BR>16:00 hours on May 21. Mrs Flora Nkurukenda, Deputy Chairperson of the<BR>Interim Electoral Commission, said parliamentary elections will take<BR>place on June 27 while those for district women representatives will be<BR>conducted a week earlier on June 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the new constitution women have 39 additional elective seats, one<BR>for each district, in the otherwise 214-seat National Assembly. Women<BR>are also free to contest in any of the other 214 parliamentary<BR>constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following several affirmative actions by Museveni's National<BR>Resistance Government in the last ten years, Ugandan women have become<BR>very active politically. A fairly big number intends to contest the 214<BR>parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet more women could find their way to the National Assembly on the<BR>ticket of other special interest groups such as the disabled, the Uganda<BR>People's Defence Force (UPDF) and others. However, most of these are<BR>elective seats and the women will have to fight for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni, 52, first came to power in January 1986 when his rebel<BR>National Resistance Movement (NRM) and Army (NRA) became the first<BR>wholly indigenous African guerrilla force ever to capture state power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Limuru, Kenya - Leaders and representatives of various churches and<BR>church organisations in Africa meeting hare to discuss self reliance and<BR>funding for churches, have been advised to seriously consider income<BR>generating ventures for church and church institutions in the face of<BR>scarce resources particularly from traditional donor partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing about 100 delegates at the Limuru Conference Centre here,<BR>some 30 kilometres west of Nairobi, the General Secretary of the All<BR>Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Rev. Jose Chipenda pointed out that<BR>material resources previously donated to churches in Africa by partners<BR>from the North, may no longer be as readily forthcoming, as these donors<BR>are also experiencing financial difficulties within their<BR>constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chipenda noted that the effectiveness of the work of the Church will<BR>be affected because in future, &quot;churches will no longer be able to<BR>secure many cars, computers and sophisticated equipment as before.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delivering the key address at the May 21 to 22 Church Consultation of<BR>Self Reliance, the AACC General Secretary emphasised that churches and<BR>church related institutions are at cross-roads as they address their<BR>financial viability with regard to support from Northern partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that previously generous contributions from overseas partners<BR>have encouraged recipient churches to start ambitious projects that were<BR>not necessarily generative in nature or self-sustaining, Chipenda<BR>reminded African churches that it is imperative they also seek ways and<BR>means of sustaining their operations in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he acknowledged that self-sufficiency cannot be achieved 100<BR>per cent because, business being a two-way venture means that<BR>&quot;superpowers also need small countries like ours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On possibilities that churches can exploit to generate revenue,<BR>Chipenda said it is important that one reviews the effectiveness of the<BR>infrastructure &quot;because revenue cannot be generated from the blue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Necessary enabling environment should be created such that the<BR>personnel involved in the management of the scarce financial resources<BR>are re-equipped with the necessary skills in financial management,<BR>accountability and other skills,&quot; the AACC head advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reminded workshop participants of the crucial role played by human<BR>resources that understand the intricacy of finances. Churches should<BR>have very sound management of finances so that problems that have been<BR>experienced in the past are addressed adequately, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saying that AACC plans to hold a workshop for financial managers of<BR>member churches, Chipenda also urged churches to come together and study<BR>the requirements of some financial institutions that may assist them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He cited the Holland-based Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society<BR>(EDCS) which gives loans to churches at a lower interest rate compared<BR>to any other financial institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AACC head also proposed that churches that have properties that<BR>can be developed (such as freehold land) should seek advice from experts<BR>with the aim of securing funds to develop such land into revenue<BR>generating projects.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bukoba, Tanzania - It appears negligence contributed substantially to<BR>the ferry tragedy on East Africa's Lake Victoria that is officially<BR>believed to have claimed as many as 500 lives, according to reports that<BR>began to emerge two days after the tragedy on the morning of May 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the 120 survivors of the accident - about 30 bodies have been<BR>recovered so far - said, as it became obvious that the M.V. Bukoba was<BR>sinking, the captain sent frantic distress signals to the destination<BR>port of Mwanza and other passing ships. But the radio room is said to<BR>have been unattended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore even as the boat capsized but continued to stay afloat<BR>from around 8:00 a.m. on the fateful day, well meaning rescue workers<BR>reportedly punctured the hull in the hope of allowing people caught up<BR>in the superstructure to escape.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, the opening allowed water to gush in thus sealing the<BR>fate of the people inside, many of whom could have been otherwise saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa has described the tragedy as &quot;a<BR>national disaster&quot; and decreed three days of national mourning. He said<BR>a commission of enquiry would be instituted immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is feared among the dead were two Catholic nuns, Sisters Bertilla<BR>and Rozita Ros of Italy and the Philippines respectively. The final<BR>death toll in the M.V. Bukoba disaster could be much higher than the 500<BR>estimated by government authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The marine vessel originated from Bukoba a port on the western shores<BR>of Africa's largest fresh water lake, Lake Victoria on the night of May<BR>20. Officials claimed there were 500 to 600 people on board the M.V.<BR>Bukoba, one of a number of steamers that regularly ply the Lake Victoria<BR>ports of Bukoba,(Tanzania) Port Bell and Jinja (Uganda) and Kisumu<BR>(Kenya).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However other reliable witnesses told Tanzanian journalist A.<BR>Kabeneri that while the ferries are regularly overcrowded, they had<BR>never seen them as crowded as on the ill fated trip on May 20. As we<BR>went to press, only about 40 people are said to have survived the<BR>tragedy and scores of bodies had already been picked up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The steamer is said to have struck submerged rock about eight<BR>kilometres from its destination port of Mwanza at about 8 O'Clock.<BR>However there were earlier reports that the M.V. Bukoba had been poorly<BR>maintained and came close to a catastrophe in March and April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ali Mazuo, a resident of Mwanza said although the accident occurred<BR>at about 8 O'clock part of the superstructure of the steamer was still<BR>visible from hilly areas of Mwanza at mid-day the same day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Huge crowds of wailing relatives and other anxious people gathered at<BR>the wayside trying to get any news from rescue operations. Early news<BR>indicated many passengers were trapped in the lower decks where franting<BR>banging noises could still be heard four hours after the tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An indication that the ill fated ship carried well beyond its<BR>capacity was based on the assessment of a taxi driver in Bukoba who<BR>said; &quot;I have never seen so many people trying to board the ferry<BR>before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He estimated that more than 200 people had to be turned back by<BR>Tanzania Railway authorities (who are responsible for the steamers)<BR>because the ship could simply not take any more passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steamer services on Lake Victoria which is shared by the three East<BR>African countries namely Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania play a critical role<BR>in connecting inland areas of Tanzania because the road and rail<BR>networks are inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steamers also link Uganda to Tanzania's port of Dar es Salaam on the<BR>Indian Ocean. Uganda is a landlocked country that is connected to export<BR>markets through Kenya's coastal port of Mombasa and Dar es Salaam.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Zimbabwe is losing lucrative contracts to supply dry rations<BR>to United Nations agencies because it is among countries that have been<BR>identified as manufacturing land mines, after the world body declared a<BR>world moratorium on the production of these deadly weapons a few years<BR>ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this Southern African country denies ever having produced land<BR>mines, according to Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) general manager<BR>Ret. Col. Tshinga Dube, who is challenging the authenticity of the UN's<BR>information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to an Inter Press Service (IPS) daily journal report on<BR>January 25 this year, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian<BR>Affairs, Peter Hansen, had hinted that the UN, was preparing a list of<BR>companies that manufactured land mines so that they could be barred from<BR>supplying goods and services to the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN estimates that there are 110 million landmines planted<BR>worldwide with between two million and five million laid each year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the UN<BR>High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have already decided to bar<BR>purchases by their agencies of goods supplied by landmine producing<BR>companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report listed a number of countries, Zimbabwe among them, charged<BR>with manufacturing landmines unearthed in Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola<BR>and Afghanistan. The four countries are said to be fighting a losing<BR>battle against the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IPS said the newly-established UN Demining Database listed Russia as<BR>the main supplier of landmines found in the four countries, followed by<BR>China, the Czech Republic, the United States, Italy, South Africa and<BR>Vietnam. Other countries were Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Singapore, Belgium,<BR>Germany, Portugal and France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our defence industries have never acquired any landmine technology.<BR>No country can ever witness any purchases of landmines from Zimbabwe,&quot;<BR>says Col. Dube, adding that there could be confusion between a landmine<BR>and a Claymore mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDI stopped making Claymore mines more than four years ago, following<BR>an order from the Ministry of Defence to stop production of anything<BR>called a mine. The order came in the wake of an announcement by the UN<BR>of a moratorium on the production of landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Claymore mine is made of two plastic semi-circular cases clipped<BR>together containing explosive and shrapnel. It can either stand freely<BR>or be detonated remotely by use of a battery connected by a cord a safe<BR>distance away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the mine has not been detonated it is repacked and stored and only<BR>deployed when next required, unlike a landmine or anti-personnel mine<BR>that can be left buried or lying around waiting for a victim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The technology for making the Claymore mine was inherited from the<BR>former Rhodesian defence industry at independence in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In spite of the argument that we put against classifying a landmine<BR>together with the Claymore mine the order (by the Ministry of Defence to<BR>stop production) stood. As a result ZDI was forced to destroy all stocks<BR>of Claymore mines. Our defence industries have never been a secret even<BR>to some diplomats accredited to this country. We welcome any UN agencies<BR>to come and inspect our industry,&quot; Colonel Dube says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that ZDI &quot;strongly believes that the idea of clustering our<BR>country together with big countries who may have the technology to<BR>manufacture landmines is an effort to keep us out of any UN business.&quot;<BR>All efforts to supply services to the UN have failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The UN peacekeeping force invited tenders to supply dry ration<BR>military packs for its forces in the region and Zimbabwe was delighted<BR>that we had been the only country in Africa that was short- listed with<BR>other countries like Israel, Malaysia etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We continued to get telefaxes from the peacekeeping office that we<BR>must hold our prices from over a year, then everything went dead. As a<BR>result, our forces operating from even countries as close to us as<BR>Angola and previously Somalia have to rely on rations from Australia,<BR>New Zealand and other far away countries,&quot; Col Dube says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically, ZDI itself is actually heavily involved in the mine<BR>clearing operations in Zimbabwe. Most of these mines were planted by<BR>Rhodesian and South African forces during the liberation struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ZDI had its roots in 1939 when the Southern Rhodesia government<BR>was required to mobilise resources for the Second World War,<BR>manufacturing pistons and bombs which were sold to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The industry was closed at the end of the Second World War. But it<BR>was resuscitated during the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI)<BR>years (from November 1965), and by independence in 1980 the list of<BR>locally-made items included combat clothing, military vehicles, mines,<BR>mortars, small arms and weapons spares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, at independence, the companies manufacturing military<BR>hardware stopped production of the same. And because of emigration, the<BR>technology acquired during the UDI years was lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Government re-established the industry in order to save<BR>foreign currency and for security reasons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Over 50 million African children will be vaccinated against<BR>polio in a major immunization campaign beginning June this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Organisation (WHO) regional Office for Africa<BR>expresses hope that international partners will meet about 50 per cent<BR>of the total cost of US$.20 million for the National Immunization Day<BR>(NID) operational costs, says a document released by the WHO Africa<BR>regional office in Brazzaville, Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Entitled &quot;Overview of Polio Eradication in the African Region,&quot; the<BR>WHO document says 25 African countries have already been earmarked for<BR>the immunization campaign. About US$5 million is expected from Rotary<BR>International while further support of US$100,000 will be given by the<BR>United States Agency International Development (USAID).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO regional office says the immunization campaign will run from<BR>June 1996 through January 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional director for Africa has established a committee for<BR>&quot;Polio-Free Africa&quot;, to promote polio eradication activities in<BR>countries of our continent, says the WHO document, adding that South<BR>African President Nelson Mandela has been invited to become its<BR>chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WHO regional office also notes there is a request to the<BR>Organisation of African Unity (OAU) General Secretary to include the<BR>issue of polio eradication on the agenda of the next summit slated for<BR>July 8 to 10 next year in Yaounde, Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the framework of the six steps For a Polio-Free Africa concept, a<BR>social mobilisation Kick Polio out of Africa campaign will be launched<BR>to promote national immunization days and other polio eradication<BR>activities in the African region,&quot; says the WHO document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But WHO nevertheless notes that although polio is still endemic in<BR>many countries of Africa, its occurrence has declined in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says the document, &quot;Reported incidence of polio has declined from<BR>3,935 cases in 1995 to 1,991 cases in 1994 and 1,512 cases in 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It adds that the partnership between WHO, Rotary International, the<BR>United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Centre for Disease<BR>Control and Prevention in the USA, will help governments generate the<BR>US$ 60 million a year which will be required to provide vaccine supplies<BR>and support the operations of the national immunization days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document says Africa has one of the lowest immunization coverages<BR>in the world. In 1994, when over 80 per cent of the world's children<BR>were immunized against polio during their first year of life, only about<BR>half of all African children under one (54 per cent) were immunized<BR>against polio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Chad, less than one in five children were protected, while in<BR>Angola, Cameroon and Zaire less than a third of the children in this age<BR>group were immunized against polio according to the WHO document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even in countries where immunization coverage rates are as high<BR>as 70 per cent, perhaps 25 per cent of newborns each year will remain<BR>unprotected against polio, the document further says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some estimates indicate that the major anti-polio immunization<BR>campaign in Africa, a programme that will be repeated again in 1997 to<BR>1998, is estimated to cost close to US$ 33 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries to be involved in the campaign will organise national<BR>immunization days, during which two doses of oral polio vaccine must be<BR>administered to all children under the age of five years, four to six<BR>weeks apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The countries earmarked for the campaign include Kenya, South Africa,<BR>Angola, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic and Equatorial Guinea,<BR>among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official at the WHO Kenya Office told APS, the selection of<BR>beneficiary countries for the immunization campaign has been based on<BR>the fact that these have &quot;accepted and organised health programmes that<BR>would easily facilitate this campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that participating children will be below five years of age.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Oppositions Zambia Democratic Congress(ZDC), Liberal Progressive Front(LPF) and Inter-Africa Network for Human Rights and Development (AFRONET) yesterday vowed to defy President Chiluba's constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also challenged the international community to take drastic action against President Chiluba's government for adopting the constitution without national consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZDC president Dean Mung'omba charged at a press briefing in Lusaka yesterday that President Chiluba had betrayed the trust of the international community who he had promised that he would consider consensus in adoption and amendment of some of the contentious clauses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We encourage our citizens not to obey unjust laws,&quot; Mung'omba said, declaring: &quot; It is a matter for which we are prepared to die for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba warned that despite the MMD passing its own bill into a constitution, the fight is not over - it had just started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We shall stretch the limits of the law to fight this discriminatory, divisive and racist constitution,&quot; Mung'omba charged. &quot;And in the event of violence breaking out, Chiluba will be to blame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LPF chairman, Roger Chongwe, said at a separate press briefing that the current Zambian Parliament was &quot;like the Parliament in Nazi Germany which passed laws to persecute Jews and the South African Parliament in the apartheid era&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Parliaments worldwide have had a history of passing good laws and bad laws. This constitution is a bad law because it creates divisions and classes within the Zambian society,&quot; Chongwe charged. &quot; Any law which has no legitimacy should not be accepted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe said President Chiluba's constitution was an embarrassment to the people of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRONET executive director, Ngande Mwanajiti, accused the government of having ignored other people's views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It appears many views have not been listened to indicating that mighty is right,&quot; Mwanajiti said in an interview yesterday. &quot;The democratic process should find a solution to the problem if there is any.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shehnaz Meer, in charge of secretariat, said the intention of the meeting was to find the way of working together to promote human rights in Southern Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sheer observed that human rights abuse in the region was increasing at an alarming rate and it was high time a formula was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Human rights abuse is increasing everyday and at it is increasing at an alarming rate,&quot;Sheer said in an interview. &quot;The purpose of this meeting is to evaluate the abuses and discuss the way forward of how we can help reduce violation of our rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other issues to be discussed are land policy and its effect on human rights and how South African farmers and investors moving into Africa are exploiting employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The workshop will also look at how to consciences and mobilise people against death penalty, crime, police and human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And speaking at the same function, wife to late Malawian political detainee, Orton Chirwa, Vera, who is the executive director of the Malawi human rights group, Centre For Advice, Research and Education on Rights (CARER) disclosed that the human rights record of Malawi has improved since the introduction of multi-party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can say that Malawi's Human Rights record has improved since we had elections in 1994.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitala, who telephoned The Post at 20:30 hours, to announce his party's predicament, said almost all Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) top leaders have been disqualified by the amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chiluba introduced, at the committee stage, clause 34 (3) (g) on page 7 of the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill which requires one to have 'been domiciled in Zambia for a period of at least 20 years,&quot;Chitala said.  &quot;This disqualifies Mung'omba, our vice-president Dr. Mutukwa, Chulu Kalima and myself.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted Mung'omba said the 20 year domicile requirement rules him out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was away from 1974 to 1985,&quot; Mung'omba said. &quot;And depending on the way this 20 year is calculated I'm out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mung'omba joins UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda and his vice-president senior chief Inyambo Yeta who are already disqualified by President Chiluba's constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former President Kaunda is caught by the clause that requires ones parents to been born in , or originated from, Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Yeta is barred by a clause that stops chiefs from participating in active politics without abdicating their thrones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Chitala maintained the 'constitution fight' was not over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In his lust for power Chiluba has declared Zambia a one party state,&quot; Chitala charged. &quot;We will continue to fight this injustice in the courts, but if we fail our legal battles we will resort to all other necessary means until justice is restored in our country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chitala said the MMD's constitution puts Zambia as a good example of a despotic regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It concludes that Chiluba is a despot,&quot; Chitala said. &quot;This country under Chiluba is worse than Romania under Ceausescu .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Liberal Progressive Front chairman Rodger Chongwe said if followed seriously, the constitution leaves only National Party president Humphrey Mulemba as President Chiluba's challenger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have never come across such a provision in any constitution anywhere in the world, Chiluba has become a mercenary,&quot; Chongwe charged.&quot; We believe that the President cannot carry out an electoral process without subverting it if he can subvert a document like the constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - His moment of glory is replayed every day on a television screen in the International Olympic Committee's museum in Lausanne. A dark, slender man in green vest and black shorts, his silken stride personifying the natural, unbound runner as he moves towards taking his place in the pantheon of Olympic greats. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away the star of the video, Mamo Wolde, the 1968 Olympic marathon champion, languishes in Addis Ababa's central prison having been detained without formal charge or trial for almost four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was in mid-1992 that Wolde was arrested during a round-up of people suspected of involvement in the former Mengistu regime's Red Terror torture and execution campaign of the late Seventies but his case did not come to light until a year ago. Amnesty International, who are campaigning for his release, said they had never seen any evidence to suggest that Wolde, a local government official at the time, had been implicated in human rights abuses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems extraordinary that the Ethiopian government, in view of Wolde's international celebrity status, have not bothered to substantiate the allegations. They have cited the problems of reconstituting their judiciary after the civil war, which ended five years ago this month, as the main reason for their not bringing more than 1 700 suspects to trial. Housed in a section of the prison known as the &quot;End of the World&quot;, it is not surprising that the 64-year-old Wolde has become depressed during his detention, and there have recently been fresh fears about his health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IOC and International Amateur Athletic Federation have each contacted the respective Ethiopian Olympic and athletic organisations to try to have him released. But since those officials are also members of the government, it has been a fruitless policy. &quot;Wolde is among the third tier of people who may be brought to trial and that means it could still easily be months before he's charged,&quot; said Kathy Daniel of Amnesty International's East Africa section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As well as continuing to campaign on his behalf, the IOC has also given Wolde's wife, Aberash, a small stipend each month to help her support herself and her family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wolde is one of only four Ethiopians to win an Olympic gold medal. His career spanned four Games, starting with the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne at which Ethiopia competed for the first time. Wolde finished last in his heats of the 800 and 1 500m and was a member of the 4x400m relay team who also finished last in their heat. But in Mexico City in 1968 he scaled the peak when he succeeded legendary countryman Abebe Bikila, the 1960 and 1964 winner, as Olympic marathon champion. He won by more than three minutes a week after taking the silver at the 10 000m. Four years later, at the age of 40, he won the bronze in the marathon at the Munich Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sporting success brought Wolde promotion to the rank of captain in the Palace Guard of the ageing Emperor Haile Selassie. In 1974, however, Haile Selassie was overthrown by Ethiopian military leaders who, under Mengistu Haile Mariam, created a violent communist government known as the Dergue.  Under Mengistu, it was the Amhara ethnic group who held sway. They make up roughly 30% of the new democracy's population and, in an ironic twist of fate, many claim they are being persecuted by their government, because of what happened in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most prominent Amhara runner is Haile Gebresilasie, the world 5 000 and 10 000m record holder and world 10 000m champion, whose heroes naturally included Wolde. Gebresilasie's brother Tekeye, an international marathon runner, is one of six Ethiopian athletes who were recently officially granted Dutch citizenship after seeking political asylum there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the wind of change continues to blow through this continent it is not just Ethiopian athletes whose careers, it is claimed, are being used as political footballs. Abdi Bile, the 1987 world 1 500m champion, has been banned for life by Somalia's Olympic Committee for &quot;misconduct&quot; and the American-based runner currently faces being barred from international competition, including this year's Games in Atlanta. &quot;What has Abdi done?  Nothing,&quot; said Brad Hunt, his agent. &quot;This is purely political. There was a change in leadership. They're out to screw Abdi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least Bile is able to take his case to the IOC and IAAF. Wolde does not know how many more nights he must spend in prison for a crime he claims he did not commit, or even how he can get justice. This is one marathon he wishes he was not involved in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The video for Qcumba Zoo's haunting new song, Cloud Eyes, features a harsh, dystopian wasteland -- sort of Mad Max meets Tank Girl.  Amid the whirling dervishes, elfin band member Tsatsiki runs amok with a flame thrower -- a purple, bulbous, plastic Seventies gizmo that looks like a plaything for a psychotic Generation Xer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lead singer Levannah, swathed in guerrilla chic and sporting a Mohawk tuft, has a voice that would induce cardiac arrhythmia in an ageing record producer. It's that beautiful. If there's any resemblance to cultish New Age San Francisco band Crash Worship, it ends with the pagan rituals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the flesh, the extraordinarily articulate, and strangely monikered, Levannah -- an Assyrian goddess apparently -- swiftly disavows any millennialist tendencies on behalf of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We hate being boxed, which, I suppose, is a very human thing to do. But we do not espouse any particular philosophy or lifestyle. We look for and celebrate originality in different ways. Our philosophy is to be eclectic. We try to live it in our lifestyles and in our music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group's eclecticism is doing them proud. August last year saw the debut release of their single The Child Inside. The song, a mournful dirge to the rigours of childhood traumas carried into adulthood, has &quot;done very well&quot;, says Levannah. Their new single, Cloud Eyes, is currently in third spot on the Radio 5 charts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the group have been signed by American record label Arista, whose clients include the original happy trippers, The Grateful Dead.  The deal, negotiated by music promoter David Gresham, is a six-album promotion and distribution package -- no small feat for an untried, South African group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group launches an album at the end of this month, and then leaves for the US on a promotional visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Qcumba Zoo planted its roots a long time ago, says Levannah. &quot;I met Owl (the band's instruments and programming expert) about five years ago while we were still students. He asked me to do occasional vocals for the music that he was creating. We then had a band called Ocean Road -- did the flea-markets, coffee-shops, bars and ... Witbank. Yes, don't laugh, there are people there who had been living lives of quiet desperation until we showed, and, suddenly, there was something they could identify with -- the music, the spirituality. It's a big thing for us. If you look at our fan mail, people are keen to share their ideas about their beliefs and values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These multi-cultural distillations are firmly reflected in their music and identities. While Levannah assuages the fears of dysfunctional adults with Celtic murmurings, the background music has echos of everything from Brian Eno's ambient sounds to techno-shamanistic ritual wails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outwardly, the group's appearance wouldn't make them oddities at a Zippie (Zen Inspired Professional Pagan) festival. This combination of mythologies from past and present don't make them slaves to commodity fetishism, insists Owl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have an external and internal side. And we believe that balance is important. If fetishism means being hooked on a series of external precepts, then it's unhealthy. The spiritual side of life is very important to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spiritual renaissance of the world at the end of the century, including the fallout into doomsday cults, spiritual narcissism and organised religion, is happening for a reason, says Levannah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Man has lost touch with his spirituality, and there's a definite movement to recover that ground. I don't believe that we have done everything there is to do and that the world is sliding into degeneracy. If enough people believe, there's a point of critical mass that tips the scales. It can only make the world a better place to live.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Being part of the global village is integral to the group's identity, says Owl. &quot;We're on this planet together, but at the same time we haven't forgotten that we're in Africa and what we're creating is African. We have a vast pool of resources to draw from and we are making use of that. Yet, the music we're creating is not African in the sense that we conform to that curio image of Africa. That has got to change. There are just too many cultural differences to draw from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening the cages: Levannah, Owl and Tsatsiki of Qcumba Zoo -- &quot;We hate being boxed ... we look for and celebrate originality in different ways&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When Hoop Dreams was released in the US and Europe, it was greeted with resounding critical acclaim. A three-hour documentary, it offers a remarkably optimistic and warm study of two black Chicago high-school students who dream of breaking out of their disadvantaged inner-city lives -- not through formal education, but rather by way of the fickle &quot;hoop dream&quot; of basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the time, critics like Siskel and Ebert, Michael Medved and the Mail &amp; Guardian's Derek Malcolm expressed outrage at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for failing to recognise it with a nomination for best documentary -- let alone for best picture. But knowing the Oscars for the cynical industry endorsement they are, this shouldn't come as a surprise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Made over a period of four-and-a-half years and culled from some 250 hours of raw footage, Hoop Dreams is a collaboration between Steve James (director and editor), Fred Marx (producer and co-editor) and cameraman Peter Gilbert -- each of whom are award-winning documentary-makers in their own right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The film follows the highs and lows of the lives and dreams of William Gates and Arthur Agee; their enrollment at St Joseph's Catholic high school, their attempts at receiving basketball scholarships for school and college, family hardships, sporting injuries and the like. In other words, it's an epic journey of triumph and tragedy in the inner- city -- where a scholarship is likely to be a young athlete's only way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The contrast between the two boys' careers is the film's central conflict and its strongest point. Gates is, at the outset, the more likely to make his way to basketball stardom, whereas Agee's family problems take their toll on his athletic quest. However, as the story progresses, we witness an uncanny reversal of fortune. There's plenty of drama, but events occur without any dramatic contrivance -- because this is the stuff of real life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, at the end of an extremely long haul, Hoop Dreams is still a very American piece of cinema; wearing its sentiment on its sleeve and full of repetitive sermonising and quaint philosophising about sticking to one's dreams. Even so, you leave the cinema convinced that it's got its heart in the right place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mixing 16mm film footage with Hi-8 and Betacam video, the film's rough style helps undermine some of that sentimentalism and optimism -- making it a refreshing change from all those ghetto movies that wind themselves up into a depressing frenzy about drugs and the dissolution of community and family life. You don't have to be a basketball fan to enjoy Hoop Dreams, but it would probably help. In a country like America, where the sport is an obsession, the film has become wildly popular. Here, who knows?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Jazz festivals haven't had good press recently, and a number of sponsors are getting chilled around their pedal extremities. All praise, then, to Bavaria and SAfm for keeping the faith and staging their second Winter Jazz Festival at the Bass Line Club in Melville from May 29 to June 5, with a different band every night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The festival gives space to a number of the club's stalwarts -- George Lee, Bheki Khoza, Gito Baloi and Alan Cameron -- to stretch out in larger ensembles or with new material. It also introduces some new combos which may bear watching for in the future. The electrifying trio led by drummer Lulu Gontsana with Wessel van Rensburg and Herbie Tsoaeli has expanded to take in reeds and horn and become Gontsana's Jazz Machine -- nothing wrong with an old name when the approach is as new as tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reedman Steve Dyer (still probably best known for Afrojazz radio hits like Umkhumbane and Hondayi) has put together a six-piece which unites modernists like pianist Paul Hamner and drummer Barry van Zyl with veterans like trumpeter Stompie Manana for what could be an intriguing night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And trumpet and EVI master Bruce Cassidy has assembled an 11-piece big band, the Hotfoot Symphony Orchestra, to present a varied repertoire including compositions from Cassidy himself. But whether the material is new or standard, the playing will be some of the best the Gauteng area can offer.  Put this in your diary -- all of it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - One cannot help feeling sympathy for new Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not that he is a man who elicits pity -- after entering Parliament, a dynamic Manuel enthusiastically took on the task of breaking down the high protective wall of import taxes built up during apartheid, shrugging off criticism from business and unions that he was being too hasty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then he was appointed finance minister -- and witnessed the rand plummet, as if in judgment. His every remark is scrutinised and he has even started to become the butt of jokes, though the press and public retain too much respect for our new wave of politicians to mete out the same kind of ridicule heaped on the last real Nat finance minister, Barend du Plessis, who was characterised as a failed IBM typewriter salesman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The words of finance ministers -- and central bankers -- tend to be inspected, like the utterances of the Oracle at Delphi, for hidden signs of economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel's immediate predecessor Chris Liebenberg and Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals made a few innocuous remarks at the Frankel Pollak Investment Conference in February about not supporting the rand at all costs after it had begun to slide. The currency tumbled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel himself will surely rue his remark about the &quot;amorphous market&quot;.  Amorphous or not, markets are merciless in punishing doubters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And they are not really that amorphous. Markets consist of people like the woman who phoned me this week to ask, &quot;Why has the rand fallen? Is it because of Manuel?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She wanted to know whether she should delay exchanging the dollars left after a trip to the United States in case the rand declined further. And by not putting her dollars back into the market, she contributed in a small way to the rand's decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She and a host of otherwise sharp foreign exchange and bond dealers are ignorant of Manuel's better qualities. They are not concerned that a finance minister needs to be a skilled politician, able to fend off the spending demands of his cabinet colleagues, rather than a technocrat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commentators unsympathetic to the present government have seen the collapsed currency as a weapon to rail against an imagined policy of economic welfarism, and Manuel as the fall guy. After all, it was the massive capital flight and consequent rand dive after the Rubicon speech in 1985 that spelled the beginning of the end for the finger-wagging former state president PW Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Governments live by the rule that their problems were all caused by their predecessors, but Manuel at least can say with a straight face that the host of economic problems the country faces are inherited from the previous regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief among these is the unemployment problem. At least a third of the potential workforce is without employment. In the industrialised West, unemployment approaching 10% starts to cause social upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And if anything has changed since Derek Keys took Du Plessis's place in May 1992, it has been for the better. Even the recent rand devaluation arguably promises to help economic growth through increased export revenue as long as gains are not eroded by inflation -- and the rand does not continue its free fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why did Keys not face the same scepticism about his ability to handle the job as Manuel?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keys, a darling of the media, was lucky enough to have the job during a transitional euphoria when an extra tax could be sneaked in as a &quot;transition levy&quot;. He came in at the beginning of the thaw in the cold recession years.  He also quit before the going could get tough, and he left without ever detailing his reasons, circumstances that now would mortally wound economic confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The day was only partly saved by the appointment of banker Chris Liebenberg as his successor, a man with less flair but a great deal of attention to detail. Manuel could learn something from Liebenberg, and the classic advice to economic authority figures: say little, and only what is unexceptional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel's comments probably strike the conservative investment community as a bit too creative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As our new finance minister delivered his response to criticism in a snap debate in Parliament last week on the rand, you could see the temper that lurks under his usual affability. For a politician he is a shade too sensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But though Liebenberg's style was reassuringly grey, even his sober pronouncements were proven to have the wrong -- or no -- effect eventually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel cannot rely on serene silence for very long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the end, investors will be satisfied with nothing less than a clear economic &quot;vision&quot;, a business euphemism for the removal of exchange controls and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although controls only remain for residents, and the first gradual steps to remove them have been taken, investors would probably like bolder steps.  On privatisation, however, government seems paralysed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Restructuring&quot;, or &quot;equity partnerships&quot;, is not enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the very least, investors inside the country and out will want to know what is to be privatised or not, and when.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does Manuel have the necessary authority to impose a detailed economic strategy -- or extract it from Cabinet -- soon? Can he persuade the government to cross the unions?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever slings and arrows Manuel may have had to endure up to now, they are nothing compared with the political flak faced by finance ministers who introduce structural adjustment programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the new Hungarian finance minister, Peter Medgyessy, told Time magazine recently: &quot;Someone who agrees to be finance minister never assumes he will be one of the most popular politicians in the country. This is true everywhere in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Will South Africa have to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), led by Michel Camdessus, for financial assistance? If the recent outflows of capital are not quickly reversed, many analysts believe the country will have little option but to apply for an IMF facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At about R10-billion, South Africa's reserves are uncomfortably close to five weeks' worth of imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With official statistics for the first quarter not yet available, the best barometer of capital flows is foreign investment in South Africa's equity and bond markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From a net inflow of R4,5-billion in January and February, there was a net outflow of R1,9-billion in April. This recovered to a net R750-million inflow in the first half of May.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clearly, total capital inflows would have slowed since the rand crisis started in February. From the second half of 1994 to end-1995, there was a net capital inflow of R30,8-billion (there was a net R51,7-billion outflow from 1985 to mid-1994, accounting for a loss of at least 2% in gross domestic product in each of these years).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capital flows are significant. Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals talks about a net capital inflow of around $1-billion to achieve a growth rate of 5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem is that a large part of South Africa's capital inflows are portfolio investments, which are volatile and unpredictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa, it is true, survived a far more serious reserves and capital account crunch in the run-up to the April 1994 elections. But thereafter the new government enjoyed a honeymoon period, as foreign investors gave it the benefit of many doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These doubts are now coming home to roost, as reflected in the rand's plunge and slowdown in net capital inflows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's quota at the IMF, based on its annual subscription, which in turn is related to the country's size, is 1 365-billion (R7,5-billion) in special drawing rights (SDR). IMF credit is available in tranches of 25% of a country's quota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For drawings under the first tranche, members have to show efforts to overcome their balance of payment problem. First tranche drawings are not phased or subject to performance criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upper credit tranche drawings are made in instalments associated with stand-by or extended arrangements. These typically seek to overcome balance of payment problems through structural policy reforms and are conditional on meeting performance criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A country can borrow up to 100% of its quota over a year and 300% over five years. IMF money is cheaper than commercial credit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politically, IMF money is a hot potato as it comes with conditions that Cosatu, and many in government, consider unpalatable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for others, including some in the Reserve Bank and finance ministry, it is a blessing in disguise because it forces fiscal restraint and potentially restores investor confidence in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typically, IMF money would be conditional on cutting the Budget deficit from about 5 to 6% of GDP to nearer 3%. The IMF would also want to see progress on privatisation and higher savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the normalisation of international financial relations, the government is able to raise new funds on the international capital markets.  It is budgeting for R2,5-billion in foreign loans this year (R1,8-billion in 1995/1996) out of a total gross borrowing requirement for 1996/1997 of R45,1-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During its first two years in power, the government of national unity has raised three foreign loans:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A Y30-billion Japanese samurai bond at 5% in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In December 1994, $750-million was raised at 9,6%, then 193 basis points above the equivalent United States Treasury rate. It now trades at a premium of 152 points. The premium has fluctuated between 135 (this year) and 350 points (in early 1995 just after the Mexican debt crisis).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In January this year, a 10-year Eurosterling bond was raised at 9,38%, 190 points above the equivalent British benchmark bond. This was the government's first 10-year loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While increasing, South Africa is still under-borrowed in terms of its $20,7-billion foreign debt ($18,6-billion), some 23,5% (22,9%) of GDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US credit rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P's) and Moody's pronounced South Africa's rand bonds two notches better than investment grade. S&amp;P's raised its rating of South Africa's foreign currency debt one notch to BB+, still short of investment grade. Moody's and Japan's Nippon Investor Services have rated South Africa's foreign currency borrowing as investment grade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign borrowing becomes expensive when the rand depreciates. The 100-million bond, for instance, now costs some R660-million to redeem, against R560-million when it was issued earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last time South Africa went to the IMF was in 1993 when it sought SDR615-million under the IMF's Compensatory Finance Facility (repayment starts in the fourth quarter of this year). But this was effectively drought relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last time South Africa used a stand-by facility was in the early 1980s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Amid signs that the money market shortage is easing, thereby taking the heat off interest rates for the time being, growth forecasts for this year are being rapidly scaled down, with housing and private consumption expenditure hardest hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Building Industries Federation of South Africa (Bifsa) cut its original growth projections for the industry in half -- to 5% -- when the first rate hike was announced. The banks' move last week has seen expectations scaled down even more, says Ian Robinson, executive director.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If rates stay at current levels, we expect 4% growth in the building industry this year thanks to the projects already on stream. The impact will be most severe next year when new work dries up due to the interest-rate squeeze; we project negative 3% growth for 1997 with a turnaround in 1998 and 1999,&quot; says Robinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The low-cost housing market, despite its heavy reliance on subsidies, will suffer as the cost of supplementing the subsidies rises. Says Johan de Ridder, chief executive of the National Housing Finance Corporation: &quot;Higher interest rates have a direct impact on affordability and indirectly on the cost of components. Hardest hit are the people on the margin, who could only just afford the payments before the rate rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This move will have a severe impact on the bottom end of the market.  The result will be a higher default rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boosting the subsidies is not a viable option as the government is under pressure to cut expenditure. Housing Minister Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo says the issue is being debated but the decision lies with the Ministry of Finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Bureau for Economic Research has revised its original growth forecasts to 3% from 3,5% for this year and has ruled out 4% for next.  Says Pieter Laubscher: &quot;Even if the rate hike is reversed in the short term, the harm to the economy has been done. Private consumption expenditure is now estimated at 3,2 to 3,5% from an earlier 4,2%, while the housing market will continue to stagnate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The lower rand should benefit exports of gold and agricultural products; however, this level of interest rates is punitive in light of the inflation rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a real interest rate of 13 to 14%, South Africa is way out of line with the rest of the world, where averages of 3 to 4% are more common. But such rates only serve to encourage further short-term capital inflows, not fixed, long-term investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Asghar Adelzadeh of the National Institute for Economic Policy: &quot;We don't want short-term capital; that's what got us into this mess in the first place. High interest rates won't necessarily attract foreign investment, but strong economic growth will. We need to establish the environment for domestic investment first, then the foreign capital will follow.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said gas would cut out the expensive &quot;gasification&quot; step of Sasol's oil from coal synthetic fuel process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sasol, which provided the technology for the Mossgas fuel-from-gas plant, was keeping an eye on Mozambique's Pande gas fields and those off the Namibian coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cox said the construction of a gas synfuel plant -- probably abroad near cheap gas resources -- was increasingly likely given the continuing improvements in Sasol's synfuel technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he said because of government's decision to phase out Sasol's tariff protection for synfuel production, it was unlikely to build another fuel-from-coal plant in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Racial differences in salaries between white and black teaching staff is bedevilling the project to scale down teacher training in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Wednesday, about 800 chanting students and lecturers from six colleges marched to the Western Cape Education Department (WCED) to demand an end to discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The department aims to reduce the number of colleges in the province from eight to four by merging some and closing others. Negotiations to achieve this have stalled over the issue of salaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a protest meeting recently, Hewat College of Education vice-rector Sidney Scheepers said student enrollment had dropped from 900 to 380 students. The college, which has trained teachers since 1941, was only allowed to enroll 60 first year students this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The department is saying it is too costly to train teachers at between R15 000 and R30 000 each. These kinds of decisions are taken for all reasons besides education,&quot; Scheepers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hewat and former House of Assembly-administered Cape Town College of Education began negotiations about merging in 1997. They discovered Hewat lecturers were paid lower salaries than their Cape Town College counterparts, at an average of R13 000 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We understand that this is a legacy of apartheid, but it is completely out of line with the Educators Employment Act of 1994 and could have been corrected in the past two years,&quot; Scheepers said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It also means that members of our staff taking retrenchment packages will be severely disadvantaged if their posts become redundant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a petition addressed to Western Cape MEC for Education, Martha Olckers, the marchers warned negotiations on the restructuring of colleges would be &quot;in jeopardy&quot; if she did not redress the inequalities by the end of this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman for the WCED admitted there were inequalities in salaries and said they were being addressed in a working group which has been established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The staff at Hewat and Cape Town College had been informed of its discussions at three meetings this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Wednesday's march, students also protested the closure of colleges and the department's decision not to grant them bursaries this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The retrenchments of teachers throughout the country and the scrapping of their posts means that students at our colleges are being trained for unemployment,&quot; Scheepers said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP Johnny de Lange was overruled by the Rules Committee when he argued for harsher penalties for MPs who leaked confidential information about their colleagues to the public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Lange claimed that such leaks &quot;could ruin somebody's life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rules of the register form part of the code of conduct for parliamentarians adopted by the Rules Committee in Parliament this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adoption of the code, after months of anxious discussion in Parliament, should mean that the register will be set up within the fortnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The register will have two parts -- a confidential chapter and a chapter for public scrutiny. The latter will list an MP's assets without attaching a value to them, and the confidential section will list their corresponding value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliamentarians will have to list their financial holdings, payment for jobs done outside Parliament, directorships and partnerships, consultancies, sponsorships, gifts and hospitality, benefits, foreign travel, land and property and pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The register will be published for the first time two months after it is set up and then once a year on April Fool's Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The register will be overseen by an Ethics Committee made up of Parliamentarians of whom the ANC will be in the majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The code of conduct also prohibits lobbying by members and forces them to declare their interests, if any, in a debate, budget vote or representation in which they participate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week's was particularly interesting, because it did not attack the content or conclusion of what was, by any international standards, a not unbalanced analysis of the likely presidency of Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC attacked the legitimacy of undertaking what was a standard journalistic exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may be obvious, but it seems necessary to remind the officials of Shell House that the enemies of democracy are not those who ask probing questions, or who are sceptical of authority, or who subject leaders to scrutiny, but those who kill and cheat and steal in such a way that it dashes all our hopes for the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also this week received a missive from no less than Nobel Prize winner Nadine Gordimer accusing us of &quot;yellow journalism&quot; for reporting that former KaNgwane chief minister and current Parks Board chief Enos Mabuza was implicated in a probe into corruption in the one-time homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is true that Mabuza may have been the favourite homeland leader of the Gordimer set, but it is difficult to escape the fact that he was linked in the auditor general's report to two problems: that he acquired, without tender, a publicly-owned 19 hectare farm for a few thousand rand; and the accusation that some of the unaccounted millions in loans to the homeland occurred during his leadership. Mabuza may have a sturdy defence, and may want to refute the evidence, but that is what he will have to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Gordimer suggesting we refrain from reporting official inquiries into corruption?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surely not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal -- already embroiled in the toughest jobs-versus-environment dilemma he has faced since taking office -- is now squaring up to organised labour over the ban he slapped on a marginal gold mine from pumping contaminated water into the Blesbokspruit wetland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Grootvlei Gold Mine near Springs on the East Rand, which is pumping 100-million litres of contaminated underground water per day into a nearby wetland, says it will be forced to close down the mine and sack about 2 000 miners by the end of June if the minister sticks to his guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it appears the corporation that manages the mine, Randgold, has some support from an unexpected quarter. National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) assistant general secretary Gwede Mantashe sent an urgent memorandum to cabinet members this week asking them to consider measures that could protect the wetland and save workers' jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine out of every 10 workers at Grootvlei belong to NUM and the gold mines in the region form one of the union's most important power bases. And as a major affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the miners' organisation has substantial support in government circles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the ban extends to other mines in the area that pump polluted water into the vlei -- where high concentrations of iron, manganese, nickel, lead and especially ferric hydroxides have killed thousands of fish and threatened the resource base of the wetland -- thousands of miners could find themselves out of work this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the union has criticised management for failing to control the pollution problem -- thus forcing the minister to take punitive action -- a delegation from the labour organisation visited Asmal this week to express its worry about workers' losing their jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Union representatives told the Mail &amp; Guardian that, while they were concerned about the fate of the wetland, the prospect of mass retrenchments posed a far greater national problem -- and Mantashe's memo to cabinet outlines the &quot;enormous economic implications&quot; if solutions are not found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Randgold says that the 6 000 people employed underground by five mines in the immediate vicinity of the Blesbokspruit provide 50 000 dependants with their livelihood from salaries and wages that total R122-million a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the controversy last year over the siting of a new steel mill at Saldanha Bay, Asmal went on record as saying that environmental concerns had to be balanced against the need to create and protect jobs for rural communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Blesbokspruit is an internationally protected wetland that sustains a number of bird and fish species and also acts as a natural filter for water that flows into the Vaal River. The minister, as custodian of the country's water resources, was obliged to protect it from destruction by pollution -- and now finds himself caught in a classic jobs-versus-environment bind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal was forced to withdraw the permit allowing the mine to pump water into the wetland last week because mine management had reneged on an agreement -- made before the permit was issued -- to clean the water to &quot;within tolerable levels&quot; and employ consultants who would monitor the ecological impact of its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NUM's memo urges cabinet to allow temporary pumping for another two weeks while the mine completed construction of temporary &quot;settling ponds&quot; that will remove polluting iron oxide and other metals from the waste water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in the water ministry say Asmal is concerned about the miners' security and wants a negotiated solution to the conundrum he has inherited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister this week acknowledged 6 000 jobs were on the line and said he would decide about lifting the ban by the end of next week -- and this move would be influenced by his assessment of the settling ponds' ability to mitigate the pollution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanza - More than 450 people, many of them schoolchildren, are believed to have drowned after a Tanzanian ferry hit a rock and capsized on Lake Victoria this week. Only 120 people have been rescued and 25 bodies recovered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disaster happened about 32km northwest of the Tanzanian port of Mwanza, at the southern end of Lake Victoria. Two other ships spotted the MV Bukoba capsize and a number of vessels came to the rescue. But despite their efforts, the ferry, owned by Tanzanian Railways, is reported to have sunk so swiftly that there was little hope for most of the passengers crammed inside cabins and the hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the passengers were children returning home at the end of the school term, survivors said. The lake's ferries are also popular with foreign backpackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A spokesman from the Tanzanian transport ministry said the ferry was carrying 433 people -- its legal capacity -- but survivors and Radio Tanzania put the figure at 600. &quot;There was no proper procedure for ticketing,&quot; one man told Radio Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim Nsoma, principal secretary at the Tanzanian ministry of transport, said that the search would continue, despite the poor chance of finding survivors. Crocodiles and hippopotamuses are among the dangers in the lake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa declared three days of national mourning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsoma said the MV Bukoba had recently passed a seaworthiness inspection.  However, Tanzanian railway sources said the ageing vessel had been due for retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ferry was among many which ply Lake Victoria, usually with passengers travelling between Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda. Traffic on Africa's largest lake is largely unregulated since the collapse of the region's trading bloc, 20 years ago, and the disintegration of the joint East African Railways.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - They call it the AIDS of the Water. The sprawling islands of rippling green plants drifting across Lake Victoria might have been created for a deranged science fiction saga. But in villages along the Ugandan shore the invasion is all too real, and spreading fast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda is grappling with a plague of Eichornia crassipes, or water hyacinths. Although the plants are strewn across the lake, contaminating shores from Tanzania to Kenya, the prevailing winds carry most of the weed to Uganda. There it brings the economic life of villages to a near halt, contaminating water supplies, clogging the country's hydro-electric dam and threatening to wipe out fish stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scientists warn that the hyacinths are altering the biology of Africa's largest freshwater lake. Fishermen fear being marooned in their canoes for days when the weeds sweep in to surround their boats.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ugandans living beside Lake Victoria say that, after Aids, which has eradicated whole generations in some villages, the water hyacinth is their most serious problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A single hyacinth can multiply to a million plants each year. Casting an eye across the lake from Nakiwogo, a small village near Entebbe, barely half of the water between the shore and horizon is visible. The rest is hidden below a vast and impenetrable carpet of hyacinth so thick that in some places children can walk on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nakiwogo relies for its survival on fishing, its ferry to villages across the lake and as a landing stage for food and goods destined for Uganda's capital, Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These days, the ferry usually does not move; weeds clog the water supplies to the village and towns further inland; and the fishing is a disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Even if I can get a boat out, when I try to pull the nets out of the water, the fish are already rotten,&quot; said fisherman Godfrey Damurira. &quot;The weeds trap and kill the fish in the nets and by the time I get to them they've been dead for days. Once I was out in my canoe and suddenly the weed surrounded me and I was trapped for a day. I couldn't move the canoe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hyacinths originate in the Amazon. They are thought to have been brought to Rwanda by Belgian colonists as an ornamental plant for their ponds. With no natural predators in the region, the plants flourished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About seven years ago the hyacinth made its way down the Kagera river and into Lake Victoria -- the same route the bodies of thousands of murdered Tutsis were swept along during Rwanda's genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the hyacinth was first spotted in the lake in the late Eighties, it was only three years ago that anyone thought it a problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The young hyacinth has small aerated sacs to keep it afloat. As it grows, its roots develop the feel of a thick feather mattress. Fed by the flow of sewage into Lake Victoria, hyacinths shoot up to three times their usual size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The south-easterly wind racing across the lake drives the plants together, their roots intertwining to lock into ever-expanding drifting islands. Some as large as 24ha have been spotted. As the plants die they decompose into a thick mud which clings to the roots, helps to feed the rest of the growing island and solidifies the impenetrable mass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the islands drift on to the shore and are blown away again, they pick up vermin and mosquitoes, and provide a haven for other plants and snakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's fisheries commissioner, Faustino Orach-Meza, estimates there are 6 000ha of the weed in Ugandan waters alone, and the area covered is doubling every month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clumps of weed sweep past the source of the Nile where Lake Victoria becomes Africa's most famous river. A mile downstream, they gather around Uganda's hydroelectric dam at Owens Falls. About 70 000 tons of weed press against the dam's outer wall and engineers wonder how much weight it can take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The weed already clogs the screens protecting the turbines, forcing periodic shutdowns and raising fears that one day it could bring them to a halt and cut an important source of power not only to Uganda but its neighbours. For years the dam acted as a barrier to the weed, but eventually seeds or young plants made it past the turbines to be swept on towards Sudan and Egypt. The next stop is the Aswan Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Port Bell, Uganda's main port, is so clogged by hyacinth that it can take hours for the large steel hulls of the ferries from Tanzania to cut their way through the weed. The Ugandan government is considering shifting operations to a more sheltered port where the plants might be easier to control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Orach-Meza fears the greatest threat is to the ecological balance of Lake Victoria. &quot;When the hyacinth completely covers an area, it prevents light penetrating the water and that causes a chain effect, because there's no plankton growth and this cuts the food chain to other life in the lake,&quot; he said. &quot;It also affects convection currents and the levels of oxygen in the water. That is all having an impact. If nothing is done, the problems are likely to increase.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hyacinths are not the first man-made disaster to hit the lake. After the Second World War, colonial British fisheries officers introduced Nile perch, believing they would prove a boon to village fishermen. The perch devastated some of the 300 species of tilapia, and are themselves once again in decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scientists fear the hyacinth will destroy fish breeding grounds and eventually wipe out most of the tilapia and perch. In doing so it would devastate the economy of lakeside villages, which catch about 200 000 tons of fish a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Nakiwogo, they have given up trying to fight the weed by hand. &quot;At first we tried to pull it. But since the weed has insisted on multiplying we've given up. You pull it out and before you've finished it's back again,&quot; Damurira said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others have offered help. Britain despatched a machine designed to scoop up pond weed and algae from rivers. Its rump is stamped with the Prince of Wales Award for Innovation. On Lake Victoria it clogged up and broke down on its first outing. Today the grey contraption, which resembles a miniature combine harvester, sits idle between a ship and miles of hyacinth at Port Bell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other schemes have been hampered by disagreements between Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania about how to tackle the hyacinth, and disputes over the use of herbicides. The Ugandan government is now putting its faith in the promise of two large harvesters from Holland, and in billions of weevils, which proved effective against a similar problem in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've already released a few but the rate of multiplication of these weevils is very, very slow compared to that of the weeds,&quot; said Orach-Meza.  &quot;You need billions, so they're not having an impact at the moment. For the moment the weed is growing faster than the biological agents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also a scheme to use herbicides, but the three governments disagree about the dangers involved. &quot;But I think, whatever happens, we can only bring the plant under control. We can't eradicate it,&quot; said Orach-Meza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem opened new horizons for a while for the Nakiwogo Women's Fishing Group, a collective of 50 widows, disabled women and mothers lacking means of support. When the weed ruined their fishing, they started shipping timber. The group's treasurer, Anne Mpimbo, said they discovered that larger boats laden with wood could sometimes navigate through the hyacinths, whereas lighter fishing canoes could not, and timber trading was far more profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alas, now even the timber operations have virtually ground to a halt as the hyacinth continues to thicken on Nakiwogo's shores.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - As the race debate in Zimbabwe heats up, President Robert Mugabe has aligned himself firmly with hard-line blacks wanting a greater slice of the economic cake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After his recent cabinet reshuffle, Mugabe slated both Zimbabwean whites and multi-national companies operating within the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But some of Mugabe's criticisms are not ill-founded. The multi-national corporations have done less for black advancement in 16 years of independence than most of the country's homegrown industrial giants. Anglo American, Lonrho and Zimasco, (formerly part of Union Carbide's empire,) have mainly white senior management structures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Zimbabwean business is largely family-owned, with the overwhelming majority of people employed by small businesses. Commercial farmers, nearly all of whom are white, employ about 350 000 people, almost as many as South Africa's gold mining industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not these whites, though, that affirmative action activists and government are complaining about when they say whites are obstructing black empowerment in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blacks, agitating for control of Zimbabwe's economy, claim 98% of Zimbabwean business is in white hands. And although that figure is obviously absurd, because government owns 40% of the sector in its own right, few whites openly challenged the claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind closed doors, whites complain and criticise their black counterparts, but they have yet to find a rational representative to articulate their case and present a measured response to the government's increasingly shrill accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, shadowy but wealthy black businessman Roger Boka places full-page advertisements in the state-owned and -controlled press, comparing white Zimbabweans with snakes or claiming white accountants employed by white businesses are really former operatives of Rhodesia's notorious Selous Scouts. Mugabe has described the adverts as &quot;understandable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zimbabwe's principal human rights organisation, ZimRights, sees it differently. &quot;It looks like white bashing to me,&quot; said Makusha Mugabe, who runs the ZimRights information department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While we appreciate the need for some kind of redistribution of wealth, we do not think any reverse racism, or racism, is justified. Affirmative action should not be for the Bokas, but for the majority who are landless, not those who are already rich.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many ordinary Zimbabweans are deeply sceptical of the two organisations representing black businesses, the Indigenous Business Development Corporation, and the Affirmative Action Group because statistics they quote are so obviously unreliable. They see the two groups practicising cronyism with the small amount of funds allocated by the government delivered to pals and members of the ruling elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither organistion has delivered any meaningful training or funds to assist aspirant entrepreneurs among the impoverished black majority. Their rhetoric is about taking away white businesses rather than expanding the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I feel they want to kick me out,&quot; said a white businessman who is too frightened to be named. &quot;This is my home and Mugabe is my president, but all this talk of how we are always wrong and how we don't belong is making me seriously worried for my future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whites over 30 were almost universally a part of Ian Smith's security forces at some time during the war, so nearly all whites are equally tainted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe's huge propaganda machine spares no expense to remind people of the cruel injustices perpetrated by Smith's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That Mugabe's government removed little from Smith's statute books is rarely referred to. Nor is reference made to Mugabe's intolerance of those who do not come from his Zezuru clan, nor of his tribalism, demonstrated by the massacres in Matabeleland in the Eighties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present acting deputy prime minister Sishayi Nxumalo is in charge.  King Mswati is on a state visit to Kuwait and was a guest at the inauguration of Taiwanese President, Lee Teng-hui.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prince Mbilini's sacking was the climax of six years of pressure for democratic change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prime minister's dismissal was not a show of political change, but it calmed the tension. Prince Mbilini was the seventh and most unpopular prime minister in Swaziland since independence in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his tenure there were two mass stay-aways orchestrated by the powerful Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions. The latest, in January, brought the country to a standstill for eight days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political and pressure groups which have sprung up over the six-year period and the trade unions, have dismissed the sacking of Prince Mbilini as insignificant, saying the real answer to the country's problems was to change the whole political system to bring about democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swaziland only allows one political party to operate, the Imbokodvo Party. All the country's political ills have been blamed on this system which is the royal family's power base. It has promoted nepotism and favouritism among those in high places and with royal blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the king summoned the nation to the cattle byre, many political commentators expected he would remove the notorious King's Decree of 1973, proclaimed by his father King Sobhuza II, which banned political parties, vesting all authority in the king's hands. But he did not remove the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the same day, the king opened a people's parliament at the cattle byre, where all Swazis, for the next few days, were to speak their minds on any subject they chose. He appealed for tolerance among those with differing views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These talks revealed there was clear division among the &quot;progressive&quot;, mostly urban forces who strongly advocated the unbanning of political parties, and the &quot;conservatives&quot;, led by princes who questioned the wisdom of such a move, claiming it would destabilise Swaziland's peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 23 years of one-party-state politics, many people have become indifferent and are not aware of their rights. Many Swazis do not realise they do not enjoy basic human rights, such as the right to own land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there is no law against this, married women cannot acquire a passport or travel document without their husband's approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the rural areas, women are not allowed to acquire land on their own.  The bulk of land (Swazi National Land) is in the hands of the King and is distributed through chiefs. -- The Swazi Times</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also a decree giving the king power to take land from those who have title deed to a property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the people's love and loyalty to the king, those in positions of power and privilege have used Mswati's name to blackmail others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiefs are answerable only to the king and are deeply conservative. They still have power to evict whoever they feel is disloyal, hence the people's fear of expressing political opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is because of a lack of vocal opposition the royal family can continue to claim it is only a minority in the urban areas who want change.  The majority live in the rural areas and it is impossible to test their political will.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities have argued that the country's political system is unique, because consultation is done at grassroots level through what is called the Tinkhundla system. The system is largely dominated by the chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was to explain this system of government that Presidents Mandela, Mugabe (Zimbabwe) and Masire (Swaziland) were recently invited to Swaziland for three days of talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there is an elected Parliament in Swaziland from 55 Tinkhundla consultation centres, the discussions and resolutions taken at the cattle byre over-rule whatever may be decided in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, this system, which goes back through centuries of tradition, has lost popularity because it is dominated by royalty and hangers-on, who later victimise those with different opinions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991, one member of parliament lost his seat because of what he said at the cattle byre which did not go down well with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, then Acting Chief Justice Ben Dunn was demoted to an ordinary judge and replaced with a South African advocate because of a judgment he made releasing union leaders during the mass stay-away. Many people are, therefore, afraid in Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the King announced the composition of the Swazi National Council, there was little reaction from the public, because the majority of people who live in the rural areas are indifferent to politics, and the minority, in the towns lost faith in progress following the King's failure to remove the 1973 decree which outlaws multi-party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When King Mswati returned to the kraal on May 11 to close the talks, he acknowledged the nation was expecting him to announce a new prime minister, but said the National Council had not had time to come together and nominate people for the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It can safely be predicted that while rural folk will accept whatever they are given, most urban dwellers will ignore the King and continue to pile on the pressure for an overhaul of the whole political system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new prime minister will be powerless, in the present system, to make any meaningful change to Swaziland's political life.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Mail &amp; Guardian's analysis last week of what kind of president Thabo Mbeki is likely to make (&quot;Mbeki: Fit to rule?&quot;) has drawn a flood of response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki's party, the African National Congress, viewed the article as &quot;a sinister and unjustified attempt to cast aspersions on his political integrity&quot; and &quot;unfair&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement released within hours of the newspaper hitting the streets, the ANC Department of Information and Publicity said the M&amp;G &quot;is seeking to undermine public confidence in the ANC as a whole -- not through legitimate criticism, but through disparaging portrayals of its leadership&quot; and its approach &quot;lends itself more to political propaganda and shameless mud-slinging (rather than in-depth and critical commentary)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was &quot;the latest volley in what appears to be a concerted media effort to denigrate -- without valid grounds -- leadership figures within the ANC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC accused the paper of portraying Nelson Mandela as flawless, &quot;while criticising unfairly other ANC leaders, the intention being to distance ... Mandela from his colleagues ... It is malicious, dishonest and should be condemned&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six advisors to Mbeki, who featured in the piece, wrote to distance themselves from a statement that Mbeki's staff &quot;see the president, with his notorious tendency to shoot from the hip, as, at times, a handicap for Mbeki&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We state categorically that no such statement was made ... we place on record our respect for the president and most certainly value his judgments and immense contribution,&quot; the six said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Coloured voters are once again the prize as Wednesday's Western Cape local government election gears up for a battle of the titans between the National Party and the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP were the victors in 1994 when coloureds chose them to rule at provincial level; this time round all the other parties -- except the NP -- are predicting a swing to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC enters the election with two advantages. It has already won 12 uncontested ward seats and the constitutionally entrenched 50/50 clause gives them half the wards in African areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's real battle will be to win the second, proportional vote. If it wins a majority here, the scene could be set for the Nats to lose control of the only province it governs in 1999.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coloured voters comprise almost 60% of the electorate and an overwhelming 68% of them voted for the NP in 1994. The ANC did surprisingly well in the November elections in Cape rural towns, gaining 43% of votes in coloured areas and a majority of seats. This bodes well for the ANC's rural vote next week, but is not expected to have much impact on voters in the metropolitan area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past two weeks, the metro campaign has been bruisingly robust.  National leaders of political parties have been glad-handing bemused voters in townships and suburbs across the Peninsula and have taken every possible opportunity to swipe at the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National politics has provided excellent fodder for the campaign. The NP and the Democratic Party make much of the ANC's national Education Minister's strategy to retrench teachers and the Freedom Front (FF) has received an unexpected boost from the NP's decision to quit the government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been a relatively clean campaign, except for complaints by the ANC that the NP has whipped up racism to win support; and charges from the NP that they have been prevented from campaigning in African townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is confident of winning more seats than any other party next Wednesday. Its campaign has focused sharply on local issues, its candidates have an impressive track record in community affairs and heavyweight national leaders have been roped in to help spread the message that the party is able to govern effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela is casting his vote in Newlands and has been campaigning ferociously in coloured areas in Cape Town. A substantial amount of his time has been spent in one-to-one meetings with families and interest groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is confident of winning the majority of votes in the central substructure, the largest in the metro with almost 500 000 voters. Central has a budget of R2-billion -- one-quarter of the provincial budget -- and will be an important development agency. If the ANC performs well there in the next two years, it will have a convincing message for voters in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's prospects are not as bright in the second-largest substructure, Tygerberg. In this amalgamation of Afrikaans-speaking white and coloured areas thrown together with Khayelitsha, it faces tough opposition from the NP and the FF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the rural areas, the ANC is contesting every one of the 27 transitional representative councils. The party should easily improve on the 9% of votes it won there in 1994, but its campaign has been bedevilled by farmers refusing access to candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apathy among coloured voters would serve the ANC well. It has lost support from teachers, who traditionally are very influential in coloured areas. African voters gave more than 90% of their votes to the ANC in 1994 and are likely to flock to the polling stations once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People have seen through the lies of 1994 when they were told the ANC would take away their houses, their jobs and even eat their dogs in NP election propaganda,&quot; said ANC Western Cape leader Chris Nissen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That has not happened. What has is that the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme has provided them with free health for their children, feeding schemes, the extension of municipal services and sport and recreational facilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a clear win of 53% of votes in the 1994 elections, the NP goes to the polls next week with an advantage. Party leaders and campaign workers say they have not noticed any decline in support and are satisfied that their voters will flock to polling stations next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP leader FW de Klerk and his wife Marike have been hard at work in the province, making more appearances at rallies and walkabouts than provincial leader Dr Dawie de Villiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP's infrastructure is much more sophisticated in rural areas than any other party and it enjoys overwhelming support from farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party is making brave forays into African townships, fielding five candidates largely drawn from councillors in former black local authority councils. It is likely to win two wards, in Site C, Khayelitsha and Mfuleni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two complaints of intimidation have been made by the NP during the campaign. Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel said he was turned away from the Mfuleni township by a mob of protesters and Marike de Klerk said she was prevented from addressing squatters in Milnerton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP's MEC for Local Government, Peter Marais, is confident his party will &quot;trounce&quot; the ANC next Wednesday. &quot;Unless the lie factor is very high, the NP has the support of 80% of the voters in the Cape. Black people are still very ethnic when it comes to voting and will probably support the ANC, but their enthusiasm has waned a little.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The ANC has no coloured leaders who can excite the people like I can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DP does not stand much of a chance of regaining the hold on local government it enjoyed until interim councils replaced whites-only municipal rule in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party's biggest advantage is that it controlled the Cape Town City Council for years and has a track record in municipal affairs. But the DP has not made major inroads in African areas and has no record of community work in coloured areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the party has made a brave effort, with national leader Tony Leon working hard in the metropole. The DP will perform well in its traditional support areas along the coastline and will win some wards comfortably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dark horse in the local election will be the Freedom Front which has won unexpected support from NP members confused by their party's decision to withdraw from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party was also caught slightly off-guard by the enthusiastic response to some of their policies from coloured voters who agree with their campaign to preserve Afrikaans and limit the influx of jobseekers to the Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should easily improve on its 2% of the vote in 1994 elections. The FF is fielding 33 candidates in wards in the traditionally Afrikaner northern suburbs and has surprised its rivals with the support they are winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are the refuge of people who have lost their faith in the NP and we are slowly building the foundation for a hectic campaign in 1999,&quot; said the FF's Western Cape MPL Eleanor Lombard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PAC is fielding only eight candidates in the central substructure, so its hopes rest on drawing support on the second ballot form, where voters choose a party. (In the first ballot, voters choose a candidate for their ward.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Muslim Party and the African Christian Democratic Party are not expected to perform very well, except among people holding strong religious views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 50/50 arrangement favours ANC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Western Cape's demographics has resulted in a unique power-sharing arrangement which could have a major effect on the outcome of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clause 245 of the interim constitution allocated 50% of the wards to former white, coloured and Indian areas and 50% to former black local authority areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ward vote counts for 60% of the total in local authorities with the proportional representation party vote making up the other 40%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clause was intended to allocate more wards to areas with a smaller amount of voters -- in every other province this meant former white local authority areas -- than there normally would have been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the Western Cape, where whites, coloureds and Indians are the majority of the population, the opposite has been achieved and 50% of wards were allocated to former black local authority areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 50/50 arrangement thus favours the African National Congress, which won over 90% of the African vote in the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are six substructures in the metropole: Central (496 490 voters), Tygerberg (418 321 voters), Helderberg (69 853), Eastern (107 471), Northern (57 789) and Southern (165 625).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are 27 transitional representative councils in rural areas and 152 000 registered voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party this week called for the Natal North head of the National Investigation Task Unit, Captain Mandlenkosi Vilikazi, to be charged with defeating the ends of justice, in connection with allegations that he &quot;sprung&quot; an African National Congress suspect from police cells and tampered with a murder docket pending against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP call comes amid moves by national Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi to probe allegations that Vilikazi's unit was responsible for the apparent torture death of an IFP suspect arrested by the unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a graphic illustration of the twisted web underlying KwaZulu-Natal politics, Vilikazi slammed the allegations as a &quot;blue lie&quot; and explained that the suspect, Khulenkani Khuzwayo, had been placed in a witness protection programme &quot;more than six months ago&quot; because of fears arising from his role as a witness in several cases handled by Vilikazi's unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Khuzwayo was taken out of police custody following his arrest two weeks ago in connection with a murder case. He appeared in court and was remanded to Eshowe prison. When I learnt that he had been remanded to the same prison where several of the people he is testifying against are held, I approached the prosecutor and asked that he be released into Mandini police cells,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vilikazi said the investigating officer in the case -- Eshowe CID Detective-Sergeant John Zulu -- had failed to inform the magistrate of the danger detention in Eshowe prison posed to Khuzwayo. The IFP cited Zulu as the person who had &quot;discovered that the accused was sprung from custody at the Nyoni police cells without his authorisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cases in which Khuzwayo was due to testify included murder charges against local IFP-aligned induna Mandlengqondo Mathonsi, a torture case against the Umfolozi Internal Stability Unit and another against Falakhe Mkhwanazi -- a youth the IFP has accused Vilikazi's unit of torturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vilikazi said Khuzwayo had subsequently appeared in court and was remanded again in a witness protection programme in the Western Cape. The only changes made to the docket against Khuzwayo had been entries reflecting the change in his detention order, and an entry by Vilikazi explaining why he had taken possession of the docket, Vilikazi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP also alleged Vilikazi -- together with two other ANC members -- had been present when Vilikazi's unit &quot;assaulted&quot; and arrested IFP member Ngiyane Mhlongo, who later died in custody. Vilikazi said Khuzwayo was in the Western Cape at the time of Mhlongo's arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mhlongo's arrest and death in detention 11 days later led to a public outcry this week, following a report by independent pathologist Dr Reggie Purumal which concluded that Mhlongo had died of wounds consistent with &quot;assault or torture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conflicting police statements on the cause of Mhlongo's death, the similarity of police claims that the suspect &quot;slipped and fell&quot; with the notorious response of apartheid police to the death in detention of anti-apartheid activists, and the suggestions of brutality in Perumal's assessment led Mufamadi this week to appoint KwaZulu-Natal Police Reporting Officer, advocate Neville Melville, to supervise an urgent investigation into the death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vilikazi said he welcomed the probe. Denying the allegations that his unit was linked to Mhlongo's death, Vilikazi said his unit arrested Mhlongo on April 17, questioned him unsuccesfully, took him to court on April 18, and &quot;that was the last my unit saw of him, so it's due to the prison's failure to protect him that he died&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mhlongo had been imprisoned at Eshowe prison, together with his co-accused, the same induna Mathonsi against whom Khuzwayo was due to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IFP alleged Vilikazi's unit had tortured at least nine suspects linked to the party and had arrested at least 32 IFP members, &quot;many of them on trumped-up charges, as part of a blanket swoop on IFP activists&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vilikazi responded that his unit had investigated cases based on the complaints of victims, not political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The IFP has a big problem if, after we have arrested criminals who are killing innocent people, raping the community, burning houses and stealing from people's houses after they have fled, it is then claiming those people are IFP members.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Text of a letter on Liberia from five Democratic Senators and one Democratic House member to President Clinton, delivered May 23. The signatories include Russell D. Feingold (WI), Diane Feinstein (CA), Patrick J. Leahy (VT), Carol Moseley-Braun (IL) and Paul Simon (IL), as well as Rep. Donald Payne (NJ):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We wish to express our deep concern about the recent tragic developments in Liberia and our belief that a new, bolder approach is needed from the United States and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have strongly supported the role of the ECOMOG forces since their initial deployment. Given the most recent fighting, however, it appears that the West African peacekeeping operation does not have the adequate resources or capabilities to restore security to this war-torn country. In the absence of a strong peacekeeping force, the major factions have engaged in actions that seriously violate the terms of the Abuja Accord, signed on Aug. 19, 1995. Demobilization efforts have been unable to proceed as scheduled, and major armed conflict has returned to Monrovia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that a long-term resolution of conflict in Liberia cannot be effectively realized without the strong involvement of the international community and the United Nations. We, therefore, urge you to propose and advocate among the other members of the U.N. Security Council the augmentation of the existing U.N. mission into a peacekeeping force to be sent to Liberia as soon as possible. The force, which should be drawn from interested African states, including troops from existing ECOMOG forces, should be placed under the authority of the United Nations. The United States can play a role in providing appropriate transportation and logistical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our view, the presence of a more robust U.N. force could bring about a cessation of the current round of fighting and could help create an environment in which humanitarian assistance, demobilization and implementation of the political transition process outlined in the Abuja agreement can resume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States has a long an unique relationship with Liberia and her people. For this reason, we have a responsibility to take the lead in helping formulate ways to address this tragic situation. Continued hostilities in the country will only add to the humanitarian disaster and lead to increased regional instability. Accordingly, we have a compelling national interest to take a more active role in securing peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Gulit, a small plot of land where women display agricultural or other products for sale, is one of the easiest options for women in search of a means to meet basic needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many pick this informal business which demands but a patch and two are three birr as initial capital. Mostly a domain of women, many of them family heads, Gulit business involves carrying sacks of goods and many other problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is, however accepted as a blessing by most or at least those approached by focus on women &quot;We feel disadvantaged only when we realise that there is no job security for us, when we are chased now and then,&quot; said one of the traders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The traders especially at Merkato are dispatched all over. They display their goods everywhere; at the pavements and sides of shops and even on the roads and streets from where they think they could better catch the eyes of many buyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such competition by the sellers, no doubt, contributes to the traffic jam and it makes conditions favourable for pick-pockets and other offenders, a situation rampant at Merkato. To avoid this and other chaotic situations police try to clear the streets off these informal traders. Sometimes it looks as if these traders and police play hide and seek. The trader's strife for survival on the one hand and the police duty of maintaining law and order on the other remain incompatible. The traders, in their haste to run from the police drop and lose some and sometimes a great deal of their commodity.At times, they also suffer physical damage as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rahimush Miskata, an informal trader, said that she sustained a slight injury from a car crush, a year ago, while she was running away from a policeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rahimush and her husband lived on framing in the southern part of the country before they came to Merkato two years back. She said they left their plots to her in laws to join the city life which she said &quot;is more rewarding and worthwhile.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rahimush also complained of &quot;the guards of shop owners hired to chase us from the areas adjacent to respective shops. I tell you, policemen are a million times more compassionate. These guards throw our goods into ditch waters and beat us severely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenebech Kassa head of a family of four children said she had no choice but Merkato to sustain her family. replying to the question of whether her children go to school, the woman said, &quot;Did you talk about schooling? I don't even earn enough to feed them properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenebech also complained on the police and especially the private guards whom she said have aggravated her problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we need is a putch. We do not mean to prosper over the experience of other traders. Ours is a business of survival,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another information trader Ethemanch Asfaw said that she did not know where to apply for a piece of land to display and sell her goods formally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mistre Teferi, 14 sells sweet potatoes in the same way. A resident of Kebele 30 of Woreda 7, Mistre join Merkato after the death of her mother, a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mistre has no idea on how to slip out of this life but she looks forward to continue her education and lead a 'stable' life &quot;focus on women&quot; had also talked to W/ro Elizabet W/Gabriel of the Women's Affair's Bureau of Region 14 on how the bureau has been trying to ease the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The education and public relations department head said it was to early for the three-years old bureau to go to great length to alleviate the problem. &quot;We had, however, approached the Project Office for the Creation of Small Scale Business Opportunities for women if we can jointly work to reduce the problem&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project office has already completed a study and other preconditions to install 100 Gulits in kebeles of nine woredas in the capital. Twenty of the Gulits each accommodating 16 traders are readily available and 320 women drawn from various kebeles are attending orientation on how to go about the business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women will also be given some money as their initial capital, according to the department head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elizabet said that her bureau takes a great deal of the responsibility to raising funds for and facilitating other preconditions to complete the remaining 80 Gulits and hand them to other women in the shortest possible time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, the department head pointed out the need for concerted effort of the community, charities and the government to curb the problem.. &quot;Minimal contributions by the relatively big traders who are opt for getting the sides of their shops clear from the women could make a difference,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Statement issued from the Office of the President by Acting President, Thabo Mbeki, May 21:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela has decided to appoint the following Members of Parliament as Deputy Ministers, to fill some of the vacancies created by the decision of the National Party to withdraw from the Government of National Unity:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lndiwe Sisulu-Guma - Deputy Minister of Home Affairs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manto Shabalala - Deputy Minister of Justice</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Deputy Ministers-designate will formally assume their positions on 1 July 1996, it is expected that they will, in the intervening period, liaise with their respective Ministers and the outgoing Deputy Ministers, so as to familiarise themselves with their new tasks and ensure as smooth a transition as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combined with the recommendation of the ANC leadership to the caucus, for the nomination of Baleka Kgositsile as the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, the promotion of two additional women into senior leadership positions in Government further confirms the serious intent on the part of Government and the ANC to ensure that women play a critical role in the transformation of South African society into one based on non-racial and non-sexist principles.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the interest of fiscal discipline, no further appointments are being considered at this stage. However, the effectiveness of government as currently constituted will be kept under review, and adjustments made if necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The National Meteorological Services Agency announced here Saturday that eight major weather registering and reporting stations have been set up with a view to helping the nation-wide effort of developing the agricultural sector of the economy by building the early-warning weather-forecasting capacity of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Engida Mersha, acting head of the meteorological forecasting and agricultural early warning project, told the Ethiopian News Agency that five of the stations were established in Gewane, Mehal Medda, Lalibella, Tippi and Sawilla in South Omo Zone the remaining three in the Amhara, Tigray and South Ethiopia national regional states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The stations at different sites are meant to register and report the direction and speed of wind, humidity, amount of rain-fall and temperature, he said. By so doing, Ato Engida said, they will be instrumental in providing the agency with the necessary and essential climatic information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency, according to Ato Engida, will use the facts it obtains from the stations to corroborate the information it receives via satellite so as to provide the public in general and the peasantry in particular with up-to-date meteorological data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency, he said, can safeguard the public from the threats of wild fire, untimely rain, frost and other dangers by forecasting the weather with the help of climatic information it collects from reliable sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Engida stressed the contribution of the agency to farmers who, on the basis of the information they get from meteorological services, have managed to sow seeds suitable for a given season and harvest good yield as the result of which they could pay taxes on time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the standards of the International Meteorological organisation, the major weather stations in Ethiopia are very few in number, the acting head said, adding there is plan to increase the number from 95 to 120.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Kebeles in Region 14 held meetings last Sunday in preparation for the council elections to be conducted a week later. The meetings were chaired by election executives who worked as co-ordinators and also gave the briefings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Topics on which the briefings focused included: allocation of election constituencies, number of kebele council members to be elected and of candidates in each constituency procedures of registration of voters and casting ballots. Kebele residents attending the meetings were acquainted with the different emblems of the candidates and instructed on how to mark or indicate the emblems they chose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Candidates fielded for the election were introduced to their respective constituencies, most of them by the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The attendants were informed of the importance of the kebele council elections and urged to cast ballots for competent and honest candidates whom they believed will serve them with devotion if elected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopian Press Agency reporters who covered woredas 22, 24, 25 and 7 observed the conduct of the meetings in some of the kebeles and interviewed some of the election executives, candidates as well as voters. Following are some of their views:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Daniale Mamo of Woreda 22 and head of Kebele 03 election constituency said that registration of candidates was completed and that 30 among them have passed the final test. These candidates who were fielded by the EPRDF ruling coalition, were earlier presented to the electorate and screened, he added. According to Ato Daniale, all the necessary materials for the registration of candidates were received promptly and those needed for the registration of voters will arrive during this week ahead of election day. He asserted that no problems were encountered so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Nigusse Balcha, head of the electoral board office of Woreda 22, indicated that the candidates will keep on campaigning from 18 to 24 May. He pointed out that 208 candidates are running, of whom 202 are fielded by EPRDF. Six are independent candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why the residents of Kebele 02 and some others in the same woreda did not show up on time, he said that this was mainly due to Sunday's social engagements such as Idir, religious and funeral services. He hoped that people would turn up for the meeting at around 10 a.m. next Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Mekonnen Argaw, head of the electoral board office of Woreda 24, on his part told the reporters that the woreda comprises ten kebeles, 43 electoral constituencies. He said 433 candidates are campaigning for the May 26 election, 430 of whom were fielded by EPRDF. The remaining three running independently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Mekonnen, who said that no problems have been encountered so far, stressed the difference between the former kebele elections and the present ones as follows: &quot;Unlike in the past, the registration of voters and casting of ballots will be conducted the same day. This makes the election process smooth and enhances maximum participation, of kebele resident,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From among the voters, Ato Desta Azene, aged 42 and an employee of the Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission, had this to say about the briefings given at Kebele 13 of Woreda 24;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I could learn about the forth coming kebele council election directives from the briefings given. Previously, when the candidates were evaluated, I could keep in my memory as to what sort of candidates I should vote for. &quot;I attach great importance to the present kebele council elections for they serve as a bridge between the government and the people and can make great contribution to the implementation of the five-year peace, democracy and development programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A lady voter, woizero Alem Belay, aged 28 and married, also said that she is posted to vote for the right candidates who will devotedly work for the success of the government's development strategy which aims at alleviating problems of kebele residents and the society at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woizero Alem, who advocated the widest participation of women as both voters and candidates, said that women must organise themselves in order to fully possess their rights of equality with men. she finally noted that efficient, honest and devoted candidates should emerge triumphant in genuinely democratic electoral proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Sisay Lema, one of the 18 independent running, candidates campaigning in Kebele 07 of woreda 25, complained that the election executives did not &quot;treat them equally&quot; with the candidates fielded by EPRDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Ato Fantu Yimmer, Chairman of the administrative body of the kebele, dismissed the complaints as baseless. &quot;They are the ones who caused problems to hamper the smooth conduct of the briefings and discussions,&quot; he reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ato Anteneh Debre, member of the election executive committee of Woreda 7, told reporters that briefings and discussions were conducted at 14 kebeles of the woreda. According to him, 507 candidates are running, 470 were fielded by EPRDF, three by Tgri-Wurdgi Unity Party and 34 are independent ones.  Turnouts at last Sunday's meetings in all the kebeles were &quot;satisfactory&quot; and election executives were fair in the introduction procedures, he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following are the comments of State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns during the daily briefing on May 22 regarding the Central African Republic:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation continues to deteriorate in Bangui. As you know, we've implemented an ordered departure for all non-essential personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secretary Christopher talked to General Shalikashvili this morning about the very, very good assistance our diplomats are receiving from the United States Marines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can tell you, as of late this morning our time, all Americans are believed to be safe in the Central African Republic. We are advising all Americans to defer travel to the Central African Republic. We have formally issued a travel warning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As you know, we evacuated 13 Americans yesterday. Today, we are evacuating approximately 55 Americans. Of those Americans, most are dependents of our official personnel -- some personnel who are non-essential, several Peace Corps volunteers, and some private American citizens. They will be evacuated from Bangui by U.S. military aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can also tell you that France has come to the aid of the United States and American citizens today. French troops rescued 10 American Peace Corps volunteers, who were caught in a cross-fire in downtown Bangui. We're very grateful to the French troops who rescued our Peace Corps volunteers and brought them to safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French troops stationed in Bangui -- I believe there are over 2,000 of them -- have provided protection to all foreigners in Bangui. They have transported a number of Americans to safety and to the airport for evacuation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are in good and constant contact with the French Government. We greatly appreciate the French Government's actions on our behalf in this extremely dangerous situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for our Embassy, we have no plans to close it. Our Embassy will remain in Bangui for the time being. We will, of course, want to assess that on a day-to-day basis. We are drawing down some of the personnel, and I would expect that they'll be an evacuation of most of the Americans who live in the Central African Republic, and I believe there are 252 of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Do you any details of this rescue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MR. BURNS: I don't have any more details than that, but it comes on good authority.  It comes from our Embassy in Bangui itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: It's an interesting little story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MR. BURNS: It is an interesting story.  I simply was told that they were caught in the cross-fire.  They were pinned down.  They could not move, and that the French troops came to their rescue, gave them protection, and brought them to the airport for evacuation.  They will be evacuated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Is there any indication that the people were targets of the fighting, or, as you said, cross-fire?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MR. BURNS: It's hard for me to say from this distance. We don't believe that foreigners, in general, have been targeted over the last couple of days although foreigners, as we've found in Monrovia and Beirut in the past, can be<BR>victims -- unintended victims -- of the fighting, and that's why we've advised American citizens not to travel to Bangui. We are advising those in Bangui and the Central African Republic to leave.  We're providing that transportation via U.S. military aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Marines will remain in Bangui to protect our Embassy and to protect the Americans there and to bolster our security forces there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is a statement by 14 American humanitarian agencies, released May 17 by InterAction, the American Council for Voluntary International Action, a membership association of more than 150 U.S.  non-profit organizations. The news release is entitled, &quot;In Response To The Growing Crisis In Liberia, Call For The Creation Of A United Nations Peacekeeping Force&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prolonged crisis in Liberia has forced nearly a third of the country's population to flee their homes and seek refuge abroad.  An additional 40 percent of the population has become internally displaced within Liberia, dependent on others for their survival. The nation's infrastructure is in ruins. Hundreds of thousands of children are unschooled and tens of thousands have been transformed by the warlords into 'boy soldiers.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most recent fighting has brought the conflict into Monrovia, resulting in a total breakdown of law and order. Relief agencies and international organizations, which have been providing essential humanitarian services for the majority of the capital's citizens, were forced to leave Liberia. With their offices looted, their vehicles stolen and the lives of their staff at risk in the continuing chaos, it is not clear what assistance they will be able to provide.  Relief activities in the countryside also have been disrupted by the spreading conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Years of negotiations have failed to resolve the conflict among Liberia's warlords. The pleas of the Liberian people for peace continue to be ignored by those leading the various armed factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to bring an end to suffering of the Liberian people, the undersigned agencies urge:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That the United States government recommend to other members of the United Nations Security Council the formation of a United Nations peacekeeping force which would be sent to Liberia as soon as possible. The goal of this operation would be to restore security so that conditions can be created that make possible (1) the resumption of humanitarian assistance, (2) the demobilization of combatants, and (3) a political process which will lead to free and fair election of a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That the U.S. government take the initiative to see that, while units from other peacekeeping-force contributors are being mobilized, the ECOMOG units on the ground in Liberia be brought under the authority of the United Nations. After consultation with ECOWAS, the high command of ECOMOG would be replaced by personnel appointed by the United Nations Security Council. Once under United Nations command, ECOMOG would receive equipment, training and other services provided by donor countries through a fund designated by the United Nations solely for supporting U.N. security operations in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That those West African governments which have provided refuge to almost a million Liberians be commended and encouraged by the U.S. government to maintain open borders for Liberians fleeing their country by whatever means.  Particular attention should be paid at this time to the urgent humanitarian needs of persons fleeing violence by sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That the international community be encouraged by the U.S. government to provide more generous support to those West African governments assisting Liberian refugees.  The U.S. government should increase its own level of support to those governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That political aspects of the peace process be addressed at a senior level by the U.S. government as acceptable levels of security are achieved by the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Liberia.  It is clear that Liberians and the international community have grave doubts about the viability of the transitional power-sharing arrangement that was created by the Abuja Accords.  Nevertheless, it is recognized that the cooperation of the warring factions would be a component of a successful peace process.  With this consideration in mind, the U.S. government is urged to ensure that the United Nations permits a role for the Transitional Government created by the Abuja Accords, only if the warring factions participate in a comprehensive demobilization program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That the U.S. government take the lead in seeing that the donor community provides sufficient funds for a serious disarmament and demobilization program which will offer combatants the prospect of successful reintegration into civilian life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That the U.S. government, in conjunction with the United Nations Security Council, take vigorous steps to see that nations in the West African region and elsewhere comply with the existing United Nations arms embargo on Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * That the United States naval vessels currently off Monrovia, or replacements with similar capabilities, remain on station off Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - It was like the proverbial writing on the wall. The two private security men guarding house number 16, Felicia Koleoso Street, were engrossed in a discussion with some of their colleagues in the high-brow neighbourhood when a Datsun car pulled up at the adjacent Agbakor Street junction, off Opebi in Ikeja in the wee hours of Monday, April 29. The security men became curious when the car remained parked at the spot for several minutes. At about 1:30a.m., they moved to the junction and accosted the two occupants of the car, who were apparently not in a hurry to leave the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curiosity turned to alarm when the security men noticed a jerry can of petrol and some empty bottles of Ragolis spring water filled with fuel. The tow men were promptly arrested and ordered not to move an inch. On interrogation, one of the men claimed to be from Jigawa State. His companion, who wore long tribal marks across the cheek, gave Benue as his state of origin. The strange men were handed over to a police patrol team which soon arrived at the scene.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As if on a hunch that the two suspects might not be subjected to the full rigours of the law, the security men asked of the identity of the leader of the police patrol team. They were not obliged, but were simply told that the policemen were members of a crack police squad code-named the Thunder Team, and from the Oduduwa Road police division - the Lagos State police command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the night watchmen, the episode of that Monday morning held no special significance until around 5 a.m, last Wednesday when Maxwell Duah, the resident security man at 16, Felicia Koleoso Street, started hearing some strange voices around the compound. He peered into the darkness and was startled to find that the intruders, who had started scaling the fence to gain access to the compound, wielded guns. The men, said to be about eight in number, also had with them a jerry can of petrol, as well as, empty bottles of Evian spring water, filled with fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Duah dived for cover and watched in disbelief, as two of the invaders made straight for the security post, apparently expecting him to be there.  Finding nobody there, the men came out of the place almost as soon as they had gone in. Within the next few seconds an explosive device rocked the security post, wrecking it and reducing the two chairs, a bed and a table there to rubbles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the first part of their mission accomplished, the intruders lobbed what is suspected to be a grenade into the light blue Subaru Turbo car marked LA 1391 AP and belonging to Funso, first son of Alani Akinrinade, the retired army general whose house was the target of that dawn raid. As the car exploded and burst into flames, the attackers advance toward the oval-shaped, cream-coloured storey building. They broke the front door, gained entrance into the main building, sprayed the place with petrol and set it ablaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funso was roused from his sleep by guttural sound of exploding devices and burning materials. From his room upstairs he saw raging tongues of fire threatening to swallow their posh duplex. Instinctively, the young lad dashed into the bathroom, leaped through the window, landed on the lawns and slipped into hiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In about 15 minutes, the operation was over. The messengers of doom bolted into the early morning darkness. leaving behind a massive inferno. By the time neighbours and men of the fire service could answer the frantic messages of the distressed household, the entire ground floor of what used to be a beautiful duplex lay in ruins. Gone were wears and bedding, kitchen utensils, air conditioners and refrigerators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also turned to ashes were the rug carpets, furniture, electronics, framed photographs, art works, souvenirs, mementos, service medals and various awards that once adorned the main sitting room. The hanging balcony was burnt, as were the roofs and ceilings. The beams, walls and pillars cracked. The sliding doors and windows, along with the aluminium accessories and burglary proof, were destroyed. of the nine rooms in the house, only two of the upstairs rooms survived the assault. On the ground floor, the lone survivor was a glassed photograph of the absent owner of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though defaced by heat, the photograph lay protected behind the solid glass encasement, which shielded it from the fire. In the midst of the ruins in what was once a tastefully furnished sitting room, the photograph of Akinrinade in a general's uniform, painted a perfect picture of a man determined to soldier on, no matter the obstacles on his way. And that is exactly what the one-time Chief of Defense Staff has done since early 1994 when he enlisted fully in the pro-democracy crusade. As a staunch member of the National Democratic Coalition, Akinrinade has never hidden his determination to see to the enthronement of democracy in his fatherland. Nor has he ever masked his readiness to bear the consequences of the struggle. It was to keep his dream of democracy alive that he went on voluntary exile later in 1994 to shake off security operative on his trail, and help to internationalise the struggle. Before he left the country in the wake of a renewed crackdown on opposition figures, the erstwhile minister of agriculture had engaged in running battles with security agents. On one occasion, he was arrested and briefly detained along with some other NADECO leaders for their alleged anti-government activities. On another occasion, armed security men stormed his now-destroyed house but met his absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speculations are rife that last Wednesday's attack on the retired general's house could signal tougher times for those in the opposition. In some quarters, the feeling is that the dastardly operation might have been masterminded by either government agents or apologists desperate to avenge the recent spate of attacks on military facilities. The wave of urban terrorism in the country entered a new phase last month with blasts on two military barracks in Lagos, headquarters of the Nigerian military establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First to be hit was the Ikeja cantonment which was shaken by a powerful explosion around 7:30 on the night of Saturday, April 13. The blast came hot on the heels of a power blackout, killing a corporal and at least a civilian.  Upwards of 30 other people received varying degrees of injuries. The cause of the havoc was in an unmarked Peugeot 504 station wagon parked minutes earlier near the mammy market by an unidentified man. The car was burnt at the front and rear, while three other vehicles at the scene of the explosion were badly dented, their windows shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 25, the terrorist moved over to the air force base, also in Ikeja.  Around 8 o'clock that Thursday night an explosive device believed to have been hidden in a parked Volkswagen beetle car, went off in the base. The white beetle car was mangled, the engine compartment shattered to expose the crank shaft. This time, however, there was no loss of lives or serious cases of injury. The main victim is said to be a boy who lost his sense of hearing due to the impact of the explosion. He is receiving treatment at the air force medical center. Those behind the explosion are yet to be traced, but the owner of the car used for the operation has been picked up as a principal suspect by the air force police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the blasts in the barracks, the known target of the urban terrorists were civilian facilities. First to taste the wrath of the miscreants were some leading opposition figures. Segun Osoba, accomplished journalist and Third Republic governor of Ogun State, was among the earliest victims. On August 24, 1994, nine gangsters attacked his Dolphin Estate, Ikoyi home in Lagos. They overpowered the two guards at the gate and stripped them naked. In the event, the hapless guards were rescued by their colleagues, who opened fire on the assailants from the back of the house.  After a fierce exchange of fire, the gangsters retreated, leaving two security men in a pool of blood. The wounded guards were later taken to the hospital by policemen from patrol 19 unit of the police headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The experience of the security men at the Anthony Village chambers of militant Lagos Lawyer, Gani Fawehinmi, was more gruesome. They had been caught unawares by gunmen who opened fire on the premises from close range around 3.30 a.m. on August 26, 1994. By the time the guns stopped booming, blood was spattered all around the gate to tell the story better. Two of the guards, namely Mohammed Tworm and Jubril Ema, were critically wounded and had to be placed on Suleiman's Chevrolet Lumina car marked AD 111 GM, smashed the rear windshield, doused the back seat with kerosene and lit a match. They then reached for the air conditioner serving Suleiman's room and attempted to set it ablaze, obviously to create a full-scale inferno to be blamed on electrical fault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within days, explosive had come into the picture. The setting was Block A14 in the western wing of Apo Village, Abuja, which once served as quarters for delegates to the defunct national constitutional conference. The apparent target of the terrorists was Muyiwa Oladeimji, an elected conference delegate from Osun State and June 12 campaigner. Shortly before 6 a.m. on September 2, 1994, Oladimeji and some guests, who had debated political developments in the country until 2 a.m., were rudely woken by two ear-splitting explosions.  The law maker and his guests were unhurt, but much damage was done to the flat. The aluminium doors and windows were twisted, the louvres broken into bits. The rear entrance of the flat, as well as. parts of the next flat occupied by Yemi Adedeji, another delegate from Osun State, was partly destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beko Ransome-Kuti, a leading pro-democracy activist, and Ebenezer Babatope, the first minister of transport under Sani Abacha, a general and head of state, were to experience their own bomb scare later that year.  Babatope's house in Lagos witnessed a largely harmless explosion thought to be the brainchild of people angered by his sudden abandonment of the pro-democracy struggle to serve the military government. In the case of Ransome-Kuti, some petrol bombs were allegedly hurled into his residence but were immediately defused to ward off disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From October 1994 the terrorists shifted attention to public places.  Taht month, the 10-storey headquarters of the New Nigerian Development Company on Ahmadu Bello Way, Kaduna, was rocked by an explosion. Substantial damage was done to the fifth and sixth floors of the building. Kaduna residents were yet to get over the shock of the incident an explosive device shook Modibo House where the Kaduman arms of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria and the Nigerian Television Authority are located.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time last year the message of terrorism was forcefully brought home to top government functionaries when a bomb explosion at the Ilorin Stadium disrupted the launch of the Kwara State Family Support Programme. In attendance to witness the macabre drama were Abdulkarim Adisa, works minister, Alwali Kazir, erstwhile chief of army staff, Adamu Iyam, Kwara State military administrator, as well as , his kebbi, Ogun and Osun states counterparts. For the impressive crowd that gathered for the ceremony, it was a big shock when midway into the singing of the national anthem, the arena reverberated with a sound reportedly heard tow kilmeteres away. The stadium dissolved in chaos, as everyone scampered in different directions. At least five persons lost their lives, while some 30 others got away with injuries.  Some NADECO activists were arrested and interrogated, but were soon let off the hook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Five months into the new year, indications are that the terrorist are back with a vengeance. Since January, there has been a fresh wave of blasts.  January 18, as Nigerians mourned the tragic death, the previous day, of Ibrahim Abacha, eldest son of hte head of state and 14 others in a plane crash, a bomb shook Durbar Hotel, Kaduna. The incident took place around 4.15 p.m and ironically, the chief casualty was one Y.Y. Yusuf, believed to be the possessor of the five-kilogramme bomb. The device, said Muktar Ibrahim, assistant police commissioner in charge of the state investigations and intelligence bureau &quot;was made of foreign components and packaged inside a video cassette and locally assembled.&quot; The bomb, explained the police, was powerful enough to demolish the hotel if it had been expertly handled. Thanks to Yusuf's supposed inexperience, the bomb exploded prematurely, with minimal results. It killed Yusuf, wounded Sara Luka, a Durbar Hotel worker, and damaged the toilet,the front office and the banquet manager's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next day, just after 1 p.m., another bomb went off in one of the male toilets at Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport. The bomb destroyed two of the seven toilets and knocked down a portion of the rear wall of the departure hall of the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it were, the bomb was a crude one, locally fabricated and incapable of doing much harm. The main aim of the person who planted it might have been to frighten the multitude of dignitaries then flocking to Kano to condole the head of state and his family. Following the blasts in Kaduna and Kano, some Yoruba leaders in Kaduna were arrested, quizzed on their political views and then released. Like in the previous cases. police investigations are belived to have reached a dead end. The police, according to Dickens Sanomi, until lately an assistant inspector-general of police, are ill-equipped to ensnare the terrorists who appear determined to perpetuate their reign of terror. The terrorists, in Sanomi's words, are &quot;people of great wits, politically motivated&quot; and ingenious enough to leave no trace when they strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sanomi, who recently retired from the service, appeared to have read the mind of the government when he propounded the theory of politically-motivated blasts. It is said that in government circles, the spate of balsts, especially the recent ones in the military barracks, is believed to be the handiwork of NADECO activists abroad. Instructively, the assault on Akinrinade's house came three days after a Lagos-based weekly magazine reported alleged fears by the government that the blasts might be an indication that its foes had penetrated the barracks. The report claimed that &quot;investigating authorities . . . have narrowed the bomb explosion at the Ikeja military authorities to be behind the blast at the cantonment.  &quot;Military investigator,&quot; claimed the report, &quot;are said to have described them (Akinrinade and other suspects) as desperate and frustrated after failing to destablise the Abacha junta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Incidentally, the thinking among Akinrinade's family and friends is that the attack on his Lagos house is aimed to intimidate him to abandon the pro-democracy struggle. But that seems unlikely. As a close relation of the retired general told Theweek, was aware that the struggle would be long and costly. On the destruction of his house, the relation said: &quot;He would naturally be shocked, but as a soldier, he would take things in their natural stride; after all, the deed has already been done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is such commitment to the pro-democracy struggle by Akinrinade and his co-travellers in NADECO abroad that seems to be driving the embattled Abacha administration to wits end. Determined to fend off further attacks on its soft underbelly - military facilities - the military regime has ordered that new security measures be put in place in the various barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures, recently spelt out by Fred Chijuka, director of military information, involves a ban on the parking of vehicles near the b arracks.  Vistors to barracks nationwide would also be thoroughly screened. Hear Chijuka: &quot;Ladies who carry bags into barracks, military men and other civilians will be properly screened. It will cause a lot of inconvenience on all of us, but there is no other way of doing it because these things (the blasts) are done by human beings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By last week, the measures announced by Chijuka were fully in place. At the Ikeja cantonment, Blade Gate, which used to be closed around midnight before the explosion, is now closed at 6 p.m. The barracks is patrolled throughout the night. Wanderers who are unable to satisfactorily explained their mission in the barracks are arrested and detained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The security at Ikeja air force base is even tighter. The main gate is now opened only two times during the day - from 7 t0 7.30 a.m. when people are supposed to go to work, and from 3.30 to 4 p.m. when they are expect back. The pedestrian gates are open till 8 in the night, although only visitors who show their identity card are allowed in. Inside the base, the drinking parlours and the mammy market, which used to operate till dawn prior to the blast, now close shop at 8 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nsikak Eduok, chief of air staff, visited the base on Thursday afternoon. He spoke with senior officers, apparently on the bomb scare and ways to prevent a re-occurrence. Theweek learnt that Chuma Nwankwo, commandant of the base, has been re-deployed to Kaduna. It could not be confirmed if the development has anything to do with the embarrassing blast at the base. In these days of sporadic, unresolved terrorist attacks, it is not only people's lives and property that are at risk. The jobs of those charged with ensuring security in the barracks and other strategic government facilities are equally at stake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - In a move characteristic of the Ogoni struggle, the youths of Ogoniland under the umbrella of National Youth Council of Ogoni People (NYCOP) have rejected the plans set out by Shell Petroleum towards resumption of oil exploitation in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is contained in a statement issued in Port Harcourt and signed by Needam Befii, acting secretary-general of the association. The Youths insist that oil activities can only resume in Ogoni when certain conditions are met.  Insisting that the demands contained in the Ogoni Bill of Rights are still relevant, the youths maintained that Shell and the Nigerian government must fulfill the terms of that document.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disturbed by the recent meeting of some Ogoni traditional rulers with the Rivers State government on the Shell plans, the youths warned that only discussions involving MOSOP (Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People) and decisions approved by its leadership can be binding on the Ogoni. It also demanded the withdrawal of all military and para-military troops stationed in Ogoniland &quot;before any meaningful negotiation can take place.&quot; If further stated that the Ogoni people were prepared to lay down their lives if their demands are not met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worried by these pronouncements, some Ogoni chiefs, Theweek learnt, have advised the government to beef-up security in Ogoniland to forestall any unfortunate incident. Shell management was said to be worried by this development which has stalled plans articulated by their consultants on ways to return to Ogoni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A MOSOP activist told Theweek that nothing can bring Shell back to Ogoni land even in the next 50 years. His words: &quot;we seem to lose our sense of history so quickly. How can this generation of Ogoni forget the pains of the death of their people and allow Shell to come back. Any other company can drill in Ogoni, not Shell. The pain is still there and the anger very much afresh.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shell management in Nigeria had offered to clean up the oil spill in Ogoni and work out acceptable community development programme for the people.  The offer is seen as a Greek gift.<BR> To contact The Week, telephone (301) 565 2753 in the United States, e-mail: Theweek@primanet.com. Web: http://www.afrika.com/theweek</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - The ministry of Foreign Affairs has intensified efforts at investigating information which filtered into the country from the Republic of Cameroun. The fear last week in Abuja is that this might be the beginning of renewed hostilities between Nigeria and Cameroun over the ownership of the Bakasi peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroun is said to be offering mouth-watering incentives to oil prospecting companies, in the form of tariff concessions to such companies willing to prospect for oil in the disputed area. Oil firms which accepted to operated in the area would have unimpeded rights to prospect oil in Bakasi, now classified by a recent Camerounian law as &quot;marginal fields.&quot; The companies have an option of paying compensation to Cameroun in cash or in kind. Sources say the deal is primarily designed for oil companies that are mainly based in France.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroun is laying claims to its Law No 95/13 which was passed by its National Assembly last August 8, and signed into law by Paul Biya its president. Section 4 of the law gives special concessions to oil prospecting companies which accept to embark on mining activities in the area. The law is divided into 11 sections with emphasis on promoting the production of liquid hydrocarbons in &quot;marginal fields&quot; identified within the sedimentary zones of the Camerounian territory and extending off-shore up to a limit of its territorial waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian government officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who got wind of this law from Nigerian officials in Cameroun are said to have warned that Cameroun's action is bound to have serious implications and consequences on the dispute between her and Nigeria over the ownership of Bakasi. This new development, they said, should be viewed seriously by Nigeria because of its long term implications for relations between the two countries especially concerning border matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only recently, Cameroun announced with a lot of fanfare the discovery of crude oil inin Rio Del Rey area of Bakasi. And to give legal backing for its action, Cameroun had to promulgate Law No 95/13. The director-general in the political affairs divisions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been liaising with officials from the cabinet secretariat in the office of the secretary to the government of the federation to investigate the matter.  Already, a memo which originated form the International Economic Co-operation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is said to have been brought to the attention of the head of state. The memo pointed out the danger signals over the Camerounian action, urging the government to act swiftly to prevent Cameroun from further worsening the conflict which is being handled by the International Court of Justice. The renewed hostilities, which Nigeria maintained was sparked off by Cameroun on April 24, is not unconnected with the determination of Cameroun to enforce its law No 95/13. The state for the current hostilities, sources say, was set February 3, when soldiers on both sides exchanged fire power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, Walter Ofonagoro, the Nigerian information minister, and Augustine Knochu, his counterpart in Cameroun, have said that the conflict was sparked of by the other side. While Cameroun claimed that Nigerian soldiers first launched an attack on her gendarmes, Nigeria maintained that it was Cameroun that ambushed Nigerian soldiers on patrol, while, in self-defense, they fired back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fred Chijuka, Nigeria's director-general for defense information, said that the heavy fireworks, which were heard in Calabar two weeks ago, indicated that the attack was being launched by the Camerounian side.  &quot;Otherwise, the sound would have been heard this way at all, because the forces would be directed towards Cameroun,&quot; he argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Intelligence reports indicate that with the mouth-watering offers being made by Cameroun, some oil companies in Nigeria may have started subterranean moves to sponsor aggression on the side of Cameroun so that they can eventually gain the rights to oil prospecting in the area. Since section 3 (d) of the laws in Cameroun stipulate that any establishment, their subsidiaries or affiliates wishing to undertake exploration and appraisal work within the free sedimentary zones could do so independently, or in partnership with the government, many oil companies may jump at such an opportunity that will enable them to engage in unwholesome oil deals.<BR> To contact The Week, telephone (301) 565 2753 in the United States, e-mail: Theweek@primanet.com.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington DC - The United States Congress sent a strong signal to the Nigerian leadership under Sani Abacha, that Nigeria must move towards a new political and economic structure and improve its human rights records or face the prospects of strict economic embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Nancy Kassebaum, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-committee on African Affairs, Nigeria, once seen as a rising economic star in Africa, has fizzled into one of the 20 poorest nations in the world as a result of corrupt and ineffective leadership. The committee met in Washington last Wednesday to consider a bill authored by Kassebaum and co-sponsored by 22 other senators calling for imposition of oil embargo and other sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his testimony before the sub-committee, Peter Tarnoff, the United States undersecretary for political affairs, said the Clinton administration also believes that a broader consensus and a stronger message will ultimately result in more effective measures against Nigeria. Tarnoff told the sub-committee that &quot;it would be a grave mistake to conduct business as usual with Nigeria in the absence of significant progress towards a credible programme for the return of civilian democratic rule and respect for human rights. he said that the Clinton administration will raise the issue of Nigeria at the summit meeting of the eight industrial nations in Lyon, France, next month in the hope that the heads of state will condemn Nigeria's actions. he also noted that &quot;while we prefer collective measures we have not ruled out further unilateral actions by the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tarnoff noted that the UN resolutions and Commonwealth recommendations along with the measures that the European Union and the United States already have in place demonstrate that the international community will not permit the gun to impede democratic progress or disregard human rights with impunity. He pointed out that the Clinton administration will not wish Nigeria to become a pariah state that might use if s influence and resources recklessly and irresponsibly. he however assured the sub-committee that Washington will be willing to deal with Abacha if he restores habeas corpus and an independent judicial process which does not rely on special tribunals and release all political prisoners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Since Tom Ikimi, minister of foreign affairs, got to know that Wada Nas, minister of special duties, left for China two weeks ago, on an official assignment, Ikimi has been terribly worried. And he has every reason to be. Unlike before his celebrated China goof where he reportedly described Ibrahim Babangida as Nigeria's reigning head of state, Ikimi was not informed of the urgent assignment that Nas was to undertake in China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not being a stranger to the vicious Aso Rock politics, Ikimi concluded that the government might after all be interested in getting to the root of the China debacle. And going by Nas' reputation as the hatchet man of the Abacha administration, Ikimi, is said to have convinced himself that his days in the cabinet are numbered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Theweek authoritatively learnt that Nas' mission to China is to investigate Ikimi's alleged goof, which is said to have made the Abacha government a laughing stock in diplomatic circles. Nas is to confirm the authenticity of the report that Ikimi reportedly referred to Babangida as the Nigerian head of state, three years after he was forced to step down. Nas is to also find out if indeed Ikimi kept the Chinese prime minister waiting for two-and-half hours, and that he refused to pay parking fees to the Chinese aviation authorities for the presidential jet which conveyed the delegation to China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources told Theweek that Nas has had an extensive discussion with the Chinese authorities and one Illela, a Nigerian journalist with the BBC, based in China. Nas' trip is said to have become necessary because members of the Ikimi delegation have not been helpful. They reportedly described the report on Ikimi as false. But going by the Nas mission, the government seems to have accepted the interim report of the three-man committee that Ikimi committed the offense. Theweek learnt that part of Nas' brief is to tender an unreserved apology to the Chinese government, which, according to sources, has lodged official complaints to the Nigerian government over Ikimi's conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is said to be going the extra mile to get to the root of the China debacle because, as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, it is banking on China to help veto any sanctions against Nigeria. Due to the face-off between the Abacha government and the international community, the government has embarked on an aggressive economic mission Asian and Latin American countries. No month passes without a government official visiting any of these countries, including Iraq, as it has placed its survival, in the event of sanctions, them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three-man committee investigating the Ikimi affair is expected to submit its report within the next two weeks. Going by the haste with which Nas is going about the assignment, the committee is very likely to meet its deadline. But as is the style of Abacha, no immediate action should be expected. In fact, Nas was said to have complained to a friend that, but for Abacha's cautious style, Ikimi would have been removed. Nas cited the Ibrahim Dasuki affair that took Abacha almost one year to dispose of. And, for effect, he reminded his friend that the Dasuki affair has not been fully accomplished, giving a hint that government might still move against Ado Bayero, the emir of Kano. Late last year, Nas had accused two high-ranking traditional rulers, one in the North West and the other in the North Central, of teaming up with the National Democratic Coalition not destabilize the country. It was the beginning of Dasuki's woes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If and when Ikimi gets the boot, he may take it in his strides. His case might be like that of Uyorchia Ayu, the former senate president who served in Abacha's first cabinet as education minister. Nas was said to have plotted his exit. It was Nas that reportedly told the head of state that Ayu had ordered the Nigerian High Commission in London to settle the bills incurred by Bola Tinubu, an opposition politician in exile, on car hire services, as well as pay the school fees of the son of Justin Tseayo, former director-general of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indications that Abacha would soon move against his men is becoming clearer each day. Like the last time, Abacha has refused to release capital allocations to the ministries.<BR> To contact The Week, telephone (301) 565 2753 in the United States, e-mail: Theweek@primanet.com.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Six months shy of his 92nd birthday, Nnamdi Azikiwe, father of the nation, dies without witnessing the emergence of the great Nigeria dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twice - in 1976 when he had a delicate surgical operation, and in 1989 - he was widely reported to have died. On both occasions the news turned out to be a gaffe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this time it is for real, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Owelle of Onitsha and foremost nationalist, is no more. His death, May 11, brought to an end a seven-month battle by doctors to save his life. Zik, as he was fondly called had suddenly taken ill late last October. For two weeks he was treated at His Onuiyi haven, Nsukka, home by Onuorah Ekpechi, a professor of endocrinology and Zik's personal physician for some 30 years. Rather than improve, Zik's condition worsened. November 14, the patriach was admitted at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, on Ekpechi's advice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By then Zik was partially unconscious and, to borrow Ekpechi's words, &quot;in very poor health condition.&quot; For days after his admission, the sage was very weak and experienced severe pains. he could not eat well, nor was he able to ease himself unaided. Ekpechi had to spend upwards of six hours a day to attend to his celebrity patient, who was certified to be in a state of acute medical emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the next weeks and months the health of the elder statesman improved or nose-dived depending on the state of his mind. On March 22, Ekpechi told Theweek that the Owelle had recovered to the extent that &quot;he effortlessly fed, clothed and eased himself without much help. He discusses freely and normally, enjoys watching the CNN (Cable News Network) with all the commentary appropriated to the aspects of the programme.&quot; Even then the doctor admitted that Zik was &quot;not back to his usual state of health.&quot; He equally admitted that medical facilities in the country were inadequate to ensure appropriated treatment of the ailing legend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aware of such limitations, the Sani Abacha administration had February 16, offered to fly the father of the nation abroad for better medical care.  The offer was made through a delegation led by Jeremiah Useni, a lieutenant-general and minister of Abuja, the federal capital territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As exclusively reported by Theweek in its April 8 edition, the elder statesman rejected pleas by the government, as well as his friends and relatives, to seek treatment abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reason: He felt that the inevitable end was near and as a thoroughbred nationalist, preferred to die in his fatherland. In the story in question, Zik was reported to be so disgusted with the sorry state of affairs in Nigeria that he wished for death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a man who dedicated his life to the struggle for the emancipation of his countrymen form the clutches of colonialism and misrule, the past few years brought excruciating mental and emotional agony. On October 1, 1960, when he proudly took the oath of office as the first indigenous governor-general, Nigeria was touted as the giant of Africa and potential leader of the black race. Soon, those lofty dreams were up in smoke. So monumental was the crash that as at the time of his demise, black Africa's most populous country had become classified among the poorest nations in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Going by Ekpechi's explanation in an interview with this journalist last week, Zik's frustration dated back some three decades. According to the renowned endocrinologist, by 1965, barely two years into Zik's tenure as Nigeria's first president, the celebrated nationalist was already reeling with bitterness about the state of affairs in the country. Reminiscing about the early days of his association with Zik, Ekpechi said: &quot;We journeyed from Lagos to Nsukka, and often he sent for me and we will sit and talk. During one of those several talks, he said: 'I am so unhappy about what is happening in the country.' He said that this is not the country he fought for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the great one had poured out his heart, Ekpechi, then an exuberant youth of about 30, summoned up courage to advise him to resign as president &quot;because the problem of your health has to do with the state of the mind.&quot; Zik thought about the young man's advice fro some minutes and felt that it made sense. he accepted it. Ekpechi asked him what it was that gave him the greatest pleasure. Zik: &quot;Writing and fighting for the common man.&quot; His young friend urged him to do just that. Zik seemed ready to play along, for &quot;the following two weeks he dispatched vehicles to Lagos to collect the remnants of the Pilot Press, (with which Zik as a fearless journalist published a chain of anti-colonialism newspapers from 1937 to 1960) to bring back home.  He was to resume fighting. That was in 1965.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somehow, things never worked out that way. On his youthful doctor's advice, the president, who was afflicted by a &quot;succession of illness,&quot; went to London to see the Queen's physician. With his health soon back to normal, the idea of returning to his old love - journalism - drifted away from his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unknown to Zik, the early '60s, the events of which had made him frequently ill, would turn out to be regarded as Nigeria's golden years.  Genuine democracy and economic development for which he yearned, were to take back seat in the scheme of affairs from January 15, 1966, when the military rudely interrupted the country's fledgling democratic experiment. A countercoup six months later and a gruesome three-year civil war that raged from 1967, literally wiped off whatever gains were recorded by the country after independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Believing that the situation could still be salvaged and that he had a role to play in that, Zik offered himself for president at the advent of the Second Republic in 1979. He failed, as his Nigerian Peoples Party lost to Shehu Shagari's National Party of Nigeria in the elections. he tried again in 1983. Yet another failure. The veteran politician sensed that he had exhausted his luck and promptly bade the soap-box a permanent good-bye. As it were, the military struck once more December 31, 1983. From then, Zik and other patriots prayed for a return to civil rule, which he hoped would chart the course of a great Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Zik left for Canada for medical checks shortly before the June 12, 1993, presidential polls, it was with the expectation that on his return, he would be received by a democratically elected president. But that was not to be, as the military government of Ibrahim Babangida chose to annul the result of the election. Zik bristled with disappointment when he learnt of the unfortunate development. &quot;From the legal angle, &quot;the sage later told Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of the election who visited him in his Nsukka home October 5, 1993, &quot;Since our democracy is based on the rule of law, whatever is done that is contrary to law will be undemocratic and will not represent the view of the majority of our people.&quot; He questioned &quot;the legality of the cancellation of an election which was said to be free and fair.&quot; lamented the political grandmaster: &quot;This cannot be what we fought for, because we fought for Nigeria to become a democracy based on the rule of law.&quot; He counseled!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that &quot;a mistake was made and if a mistake was made, it should be rectified.&quot; Three years later, Abiola remains in detention for attempting to reclaim his supposed mandate, w while the Abacha regime has spurned global entreaties to respect human rights and quickly return power to civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Zik, the ultimate heart breaker was to come last October 30, when Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Ogoni folk hero, was convicted alongside eight other activist, the climax of a controversial murder trial. The hasty hanging of the men November 10 touched the raw nerves of the international community, which rained sanctions on the country, turning her into a pariah. Seiko's heart literally stopped beating. As exclusively reported by Theweek early last month, the health of the ex-president reached a crisis point with the Ogoni debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like a pendulum, Zik's condition dramatically swung to the valleys two weeks ago. march 10 the patriarch went into a coma. As if it was meant to be a bad omen, Patrick Okolo, the Owelle's townsman and chief medical director of UNTH, died that night. Okolo, who became UNTH boss four years ago, had been seriously sick since early last month, the health of the ex-president reached a crisis point with the Ogoni debacle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zik woke up some hours later but only briefly - for a final glance at the world which he always said he was fond of and not in a hurry to leave. By 11 p.m. that Saturday, it was time for the legendary nationalist to drink of the cup he alluded in one of his works, Thenatosis&quot; &quot;One day, we must vacate this bounteous earth and travel to a world beyond our ken. All human problems will by then abate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A member of the medical team that attended to Zik in his last hours told Theweek that it was a miracle that the political icon survived for the much he did. Said the source: &quot;Zik was in bad condition the whole of that week to the extent that we did not know that he would survive up to Saturday when de died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to hospital sources, one of the laboratory tests carried out on Zik during his days in UNTH suggested &quot;renal problems or renal involvement: which means in the lay man's explanation, that he may have died of kidney problems.&quot; The sources explained that the kidney connection was not unusual for a man of Zik's age. Other subsequent tests on the elder statesman indicated that he had arthritis. Theweek learnt that during his stay in the hospital, Zik often complained of general weakness and severe pains. To ensure that details of his illness remained a top secret, Zik's name was neither written on his folder, nor were his diagnosis, tests and prescriptions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who were with Zik in his last minutes were Uche, his wife, duty nurses and Ekpechi. According to hospital sources, Zik did not struggle with death when it came. &quot;He simply gave up, &quot; said a source. By the time he passed on, the elder statesman's kidneys were said to have been so badly damaged as to ensure that he died quietly. Immediately he gave up, Uche shouted at the top of her voice and started weeping. Ekpechi, who reportedly was also in tears, bravely put up a manly face and consoled her. It was Ekpechi who made the first contact with the government and Zik's son, Emeka, who was said to be in Abuja at the time his father died. Others that were contacted were Chukwuma, Emeka's elder brother, Emeka Ojukwu and Chekwas Okorie, a politician and cultural crusader based at Enugu. The same evening Uche was said to have checked out of the hospital to the family home in Nsukka. She later left for Onitsha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zik's body was removed to the Eastern Nigeria Medical Centre, also in Enugu, later in the night, by UNTH ambulance in the company of Ekpechi, Ojukwu, and other unnamed Onitsha indigenes and officials of the Enugu State government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expectedly, news of Zik's death threw the nation into mourning and people spoke glowing of his priceless qualities. In his tribute, Adeniran Ogunsanya, arguably the closest political associate of the former president, described him as a rare breed. &quot;The great Zik,&quot; said Ogunsanya, one-time chairman of the disbanded NPP, &quot;was ready to stand his ground at all cost when he thought it was wiser for the sake of the unity of the country... He refused to accept the use of tribalism to achieve some of those things he set out to achieve. he never believed in tribalism. He never took decisions behind our back. Consensus was the word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although his death has been confirmed by authoritative sources, Zik is yet to be officially pronounced dead. As an Onitsha high chief, tradition dictates that only the obi-in-Council, in consultation with his family and ndichie (elders) could announce such a development. The announcement would.  however, have to wait until the performance of certain rituals, a process which could take all of a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As at press time, a flurry of meetings involving Zik's family, Onitsa ndichie, the Obi-in-Council and the government were being held. The consultations would serve as a prelude to the formal announcement of the passing away of an accomplished athlete, journalist, scholar, politician, leader and freedom fighter. Also being discussed at the various meetings are plans for his burial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the man of history remains technically alive pending the official proclamation of his death. Even after that much-awaited proclamation, the Zik of Africa would continue to live in the hearts of those whose lives he touched in several ways during his eventful sojourn in the planet very much after his heart</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Women's Lobby Group has issued a declaration of peace in the African region which strongly condemns all sorts of violence and threats to peace currently taking place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chairperson Ms Gladys Mutukwa said in an interview that women in Zambia and other African countries condemn the perpetrators of violence as women are the most vulnerable when wars breakput in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mutukwa said the lobby group will soon send the declaration, which also calls for the inclusion of women in peace negotions, to the organisation of african unity (oau).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She regretted that although women are the ones who suffer most when wars break out, they are left out when it comes to peace negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The declaration seeks for the recognition of women in peace negotiation processes through out Africa,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The declaration was one the resolutions passed at the just ended regional workshop for women in politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mutukwa also condemned the recent bombing of State</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> House outer wall and for which the &quot;Black Mamba&quot; group has claimed responsibility, saying there are better methods of resolving grievances. She said as a non-partisan group, the Women's' Lobby discourages any threats to peace be it from the ruling party MMD or the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Ms Mutukwa said the lobby group is working flat out to ensure that more women participate in the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections as part of the implementation of the beijing platform of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said the area is still critical as most of the women in the world are left of out in the political arena which is important for national development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mutukwa said most governments continue using women for entertainment and hospitality purposes only other than political decision making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This trend will continue seeing lopsided developed in Africa and Asia as key players in national development remain passive,&quot; she lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said to that effect, the organisation will soon link up to Internet and in this way get connected to all women's' lobby groups in the region so that they share information on potential women leadership who can also represent their respective countries in internal affairs as well as at international organisations like the OAU and COMESA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms said the network will be operational in four months time with the help of the donor community who have shown willingness in the area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) has not paid to the government charges for air pollution since 1994, claims the Ministry of Mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ZCCM insists that they pay K38 million every month for emissions of sulphur dioxide from the mines at Mufulira and Nkana Divisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emissions have been identified through medical research as contributing to the high incidence of lung disease on the Copperbelt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And ZCCM safety unit manager, Francis Imasiku, assured journalists attending a one week workshop on ZCCM at the Zambia Institute of Mass Communications last Friday that the mining company now has an environmental programme to guard against air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, permanent secretary in the Ministry of Mines, Joseph Phiri, in reply to a Post query last Friday, said Nkana mine pays only K3. 5 million per month and has not yet started making the remittances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said government expects an average of K39 million from Mufulira Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;To date ZCCM have not started paying the money. The divisions have applied to the government to reduce the charges. And when they do pay, the money will be used as part of the appropriation in aid by the mines safety department,&quot; Phiri said. &quot;Through the implementation of statutory instrument 119 of 1994 (Mineral Resource Extraction Regulation), ZCCM Nkana Division is supposed to pay government an average of K3.5 million per month in parafiscal charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phiri said government was only expecting payment from the Nkana and Mufulira Divisions &quot;which are the only divisions venting sulphur dioxide&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imasiku said ZCCM had undertaken a study to lessen the amount of sulphur dioxide in the air &quot;which medical experts have found to be a cause of various lung diseases amongst the mining community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At Nkana mine, sulphur dioxide is being used in the manufacture of acid so that there might be reduced amounts in the air&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Environmental issues are of great concern to us. We pay K10 per kilogramme of sulphur in the air and this can be costly to the company,&quot; he revealed. &quot;We pay K38 million per month to the government for this sulphur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Imasiku also regretted that government had let ZCCM take over the inspection of their manufacturing investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government factory inspectorate is practically dead,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ZCCM had long abandoned waiting for the government inspectors in matters concerning their sawmill factory in Kitwe which falls under Mulungushi investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Imasiku commended the government mines inspectorate which he said though shorthanded, did its best to carry out its duties effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The presence of a government inspectorate acts as a stimulant to the company which will do its best to maintain safety standards,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia yesterday maintained her regional reputation as a powerful soccer nation after silencing Taifa Stars of Tanzania 1-0 in a cliff-hanger victory at Lusaka's Independence Stadium .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The match, which was played to a barren crowd, with spectators one would expect to find at a corrupt politician's burial, saw the Zambians who were playing with almost the whole team that played at the Africa Nations Cup in South Africa penetrate the Taifa Stars' goal area with a clear chance by Kenneth &quot;Bubble&quot; Malitoli missing the back of the net by the might of the towering Tanzanian goalie, Rifati Saidi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parading one of the hottest frontlines involving Dennis Lota, and Mwape Miti as twin strikers, with Andrew Tembo and Malitoli attacking from the midfield, Zambia failed to get any goal in the first half.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was only five minutes into the second half that Zambia clinched the winner via a Hillary Makasa spot kick which came after Kenneth Malitoli, skipper of the day, had his sole-move inside the Taifa Stars' danger zone rewarded with a hard tackle from central defenders, Abdala Huseni Msheri and Paul John.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spot kick itself was a classic with Tanzanian goalie, Saidi, diving in the opposite direction and the ball going in through the other direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The match has been good, and what I observed was that we only have to work on a few areas, mostly in re-organising ourselves from midfield. But I am impressed with the performance though we missed a lot of chances,&quot; said Poulsen who rested Dennis Lota, Mwape Miti; Alex Namazaba, for the Rumlex duo: Cosmas Banda and Limbi Mbewe and Zanaco's Edward &quot;Bubble Brown&quot; Kangwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Taifa Stars trainer Mzee Kheri, whose side is gearing up for a World Cup qualifier, said his team has learned some lessons from the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think Zambia has given us the best preparations and we are now ready for any team. The match was important because it has helped us look at some problems in the team,&quot; said Kheri.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He revealed that the interim FAZ committee will continue performing the duties until the draft has been sent to FIFA and acknowledge government proposal. he pointed out that the controversial FAZ elections will be held after hearing from FIFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the current FAZ constitution it allows the individuals with proven soccer clubs and associations record affiliated to FAZ to contest for the elections at the annual general meeting after a four year term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There will be no closed shop. Every person willing to be elected into FAZ shall lodge a nomination to stand and it will help promote the standard of soccer,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the debates for the postponed FAZ elections which were scheduled to take place in Kabwe this month some of the team officials in the midlands ruled the government proposal as being clearly &quot;off-side&quot; to allow every &quot;jim and jack&quot; to contest the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They claimed that soccer just like any other institution required persons with adequate soccer knowledge to avoid the number one sport being thrown into the &quot;dust bin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been an &quot;outcry&quot; from FAZ about interference from the government but government denies. However it is FAZ council meeting which adopt and approve the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The South African government has dismissed as false claims by The Sun, a weekly news paper owned and controlled by MMD chairman Sikota Wina, that opposition UNIP was training mercenaries in their territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNIP has described as &quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;malicious&quot; claims that the party has entered into an agreement with former manager of Circuit Holdings, Malcom Fried, to turn his Johannesburg farm in South Africa into a training camp for its mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African High Commissioner to Zambia, Sam Sterban, who spoke through his secretary, expressed ignorance about the alleged training camp or the mercenaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He says he does not know any more than what he has read in The Sun newspaper,&quot; the secretary said. &quot;But he has instituted investigations and will let you know if anything comes up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a spokesperson for the South African department of foreign affairs in Pretoria, Clara Kaesewetter, denied any knowledge of the mercenaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the High Commissioner there is not aware, then our department hasn't got any further information,&quot; Kaesewetter said in a telephone interview yesterday, stressing: &quot;The South African government is against the training of mercenaries in South Africa or any part of the world and steps have been taken to curtail such activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP vice-president, senior chief Inyambo Yeta, said in an interview yesterday that the allegations were &quot;a lot of lies&quot; and dared police to arrest those it thinks are involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's just not true,&quot; a visibly annoyed chief Yeta said, adding: &quot;These stupid and malicious allegations have been going on for a long time. There has been talk of UNIP getting cars from President Nelson Mandela and now they are saying we are training mercenaries in South Africa. If they have evidence why don't they come and arrest us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, according to a front page story in The Sun issue of May 20-26, 1996, 200 UNIP cadres and mercenaries have already been taken out of the country and are camped at the same farm for military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, in a separate interview, former president Kenneth Kaunda's press assistant, Muhabi Lungu, denied that former member of the central committee in the UNIP government, Alexander Kamalondo, was recuperating at Freid's farm, as alleged by The Sun .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Kamalondo is a very sick man and yes, he is in South Africa,&quot; Lungu said, asking: &quot;But how can a sick man recuperate at a military training camp?  That is ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lungu also explained the association between UNIP and Malcom Freid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is running the Kenneth Kaunda Peace Foundation in South Africa,&quot; Lungu said. &quot;There is no secret about that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Force public relations officer, Francis Musonda, could neither confirm nor deny whether the alleged mercenaries were the ones Inspector General of Police, Francis Ndhlovu, was referring to when he claimed last year that an opposition party was training mercenaries in a neighbouring country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am not the one who made that statement so I cannot comment on that,&quot; Musonda said. &quot;Get in touch with the Inspector General and get a comment from him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When contacted over the mattter, Information minister and government spokesman, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, referred all queries to the Inspector General of Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I would like to refer you to the Inspector General of Police. He is the only one competent to deal with such issues,&quot; Mwanamwambwa said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Peasant Farmers Union of Zambia chairman, Patrick Kayeka, on Friday disclosed that his organisation was planning to buy 60 per cent of the shares of Lima Bank, a farming lending institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayela said the union was setting up a Peasant Farmers Investment Fund to be launched on June 28 and expects over 700,000 peasant farmers to contribute the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a draft of the proposed plan, the peasant farmers' union is to collect about K60,000 from peasant farmers to start the fund that will be managed by Zambia National Commercial Bank - the bank with most branches all over the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayeka said copies of the proposed plan had already been made available to both the Zambia Privatisation Agency and the agriculture ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A campaign has already been launched by the union to encourage the peasant farmers to contribute towards ownership of the &quot;limping&quot; Lima Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The union expects to raise K42 billion from the over 700,000 peasant farmers over two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We'll soon start holding seminars and workshops to let them know the advantages of owning the bank in a bid to recapitalise the institution for their own benefit,&quot; Kayeka said in an interview on Friday. &quot;Four provinces have already been visited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The provinces visited are Eastern, Southern, Western and Central Provinces and the received response has resulted in the setting up of farmers committees to facilitate the payments prior to banking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the proposed shareholding of the bank, the government, bank management, transporters, other agro producers will each have a share holding of 10 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agricultural minister Suresh Desai confirmed receiving the plan but could not disclose the government's stand on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mukuma, however, maintained the Lusaka- London route was still vacant contrary to an earlier statementa by the transport ministry deputy minister Gilbert Mululu that it had been allocated to Alliance Airline.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Thursday, Aero Zambia management challenged the ministry to state what documents had not been submitted but the permanent secretary is yet to disclose missing the ones.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Shortage of chickens in the country may end with the re-opening of Lusaka's Hybrid Poultry Farm's hatchery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an interview on Sunday, Hybrid Hatchery Farm assistant manager, Singani Mutyambe disclosed that the go-ahead to resume production was given by veterinary officials from the Ministry of Agriculture after a series of examinations of the premises.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We expect our first hatching after the closure on May 30 with about 55,000 birds but we've continued sample taking of the produce despite the veterinary clearance to ensure that the infection levels remain at Zero,&quot; Mutyambe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He revealed that a total of 90,000 eggs valued at K61million were destroyed last month after the discovery of the disease affecting the day-old chicks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutyambe attributed the source of the disease to the company's other farm, Green Valley Farm, the egg source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutyambe said this development led to the halting of production at Green Valley Farm and the Hatchery, with the former having all its parent breeders slaughtered in a bid to eradicate the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Among the measures taken to control the outbreak were the vast re-washing of the hatchery, strict monitoring of traffic and the introduction of foot bath for both vehicle entering the premises,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agriculture minister Suresh Desai yesterday promised to give a press release on the matter after studying the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Zambia National Farmers Union executive director, George Grey, last Friday cautioned farmers from sourcing day old chicks from Zimbabwe saying the country had suffered a serious outbreak of Newcastle disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danbury - Jaojoby, Salegy!. Jaojoby (pronounced &quot;Dzo-Dzoob&quot;) Eusebe is Madagascar's king of &quot;salegy,&quot; the exciting 6/8 dance rhythm of the hottest local guitar band dance music of this Indian Ocean island. Recorded live and kicking in a small Antananarivo studio and later mixed in London by Ben Mandelson and Ian Anderson, Salegy! was the first-ever CD of authentic Malagasy salegy. The mesmerizing groove is punctuated by unbeatable three part vocals, tight as they come, and guitars which often reverse mainland Africa practice by having a muted tone on the lead and a harder edge on the second player. Released in Madagascar in 1992, this album still gets in airplay the daily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jaojoby's career at the top of his musical form spans 20 years and his music is heard regularly in night clubs, bars and bush-taxis, while his songs are covered by bands all over the country. From 1976 through the early 80's (when the local recording industry collapsed), several of Jaojoby's salegy singles reputedly sold over 60,000 copies in Madagascar. Salegy! showcases Jaojoby's latest and hottest group that he started in 1988, and all of his most popular songs. As well as heavily featuring salegy, the band performs other local rhythms like sega, watcha-watcha, sigoma and even put their unique spin on James Brown-style funk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Xenophile label-mates Tarika have played a large role in popularizing Malagasy roots music world-wide by touring their compact, semi-acoustic line-up, the financial logistics of touring a 9-piece electric band abroad have kept Jaojoby as one of Madagascar's best secrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is about to change. Jaojoby finally made a triumphant European debut with his band in France in 1994 (and is due back there for a lengthy tour in the summer of 1996). With Xenophile's world-wide re-release of SALEGY!, Madagascar's king of salegy should ascend to many more thrones.  SALEGY! -- Xenophile #4040.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chief Stephen Osita Osadebe, Kedu America(&quot;Greetings from America&quot;)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the late 1950's, Chief Stephen Osita Osade has been pursuing his musical muse. It was during this time the young singer made a trek from the rural village of his birth to Lagos, the capital city of Nigeria and the center of the pop music scene known as &quot;highlife&quot;. Starting as a backup singer with popular highlife band leader Stephen Ameche, Chief Stephen soon blossomed into a band leader of renown. In fact a history of highlife reads like a Osadebe bibliography, and in the early 1980's Osadebe released the album that would come to define the genre: Osandi Owende, the first and only platinum record to be awarded a Nigerian artist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now on Kedu America (Greetings From America), &quot;The Consistent Highlife King&quot;, returns, letting (getting) loose on an album of scintillating polyrhythmic African drums, jazzy horn lines and sultry, repeating guitar riffs that further exemplify why Chief Stephen, &quot;The Doctor of Hypertension&quot; is the undisputed ruler of the Nigerian dance hall. KEDU AMERICA (&quot;Greetings From America&quot;) -- Xenophile #4044.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both CDs are available from Xenophile Records, 43 Beaver Brook Road, Danbury, CT 06810. Phone: 203 730-0333. Fax: 203 730-0345.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is appalled to learn of further unrest in Bangui and condemns the violent actions, including the taking of hostages, carried out by members of the armed forces of the Central African Republic. We call on all parties to resolve the situation peacefully, through a negotiated settlement which respects the rule of law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe that the concerns of the military should then be addressed by the Committee established for that purpose in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reaffirmation of civilian rule in Bangui is the only solution which respects the will of the people of the Central African Republic. We call on all troops to observe the proper role of the military in a democratic society, which is to serve at the command of duly elected civilian authorities. Legitimate grievances must not be expressed or addressed through violent and undemocratic acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States underscores its determination to work with the international community to press for full restoration of civil order in the Central African Republic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the official text of a letter on Liberia from President Clinton to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, dated May 20, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 11, 1996, I reported that U.S. military forces equipped for combat had entered Monrovia, Liberia, for the purpose of evacuating American citizens and certain third-country nationals from that strife-torn city. This letter is provided, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, to update the Congress on the continued deployment of U.S. forces, including the response by those forces to several isolated attacks on the American Embassy complex on April 30, 1996, and May 6, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As of this date, U.S. forces have evacuated over 2,300 persons from Monrovia, including over 470 American citizens. The U.S. Special Operations and U.S. Army Europe forces that conducted the initial evacuations have been replaced by U.S. Marines assigned to a Marine Amphibious Ready Group offshore in the immediate vicinity of Monrovia. Approximately 280 Marines and other U.S. military personnel from the total U.S. force of 2,500 are currently ashore at the American Embassy complex. In addition to protecting American lives and property at the Embassy complex, the mission of these forces is to maintain the capability to conduct further evacuations if circumstances warrant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 30, 1996, three separate attacks occurred against the American Embassy complex reportedly involving fighters from several factions. In the first encounter, a U.S. Marine was grazed by a round fired by one of the attackers. The Marines did not return fire, and the injured Marine was able to return to duty on the same day. In the second attack, a Marine was struck by plywood splinters dislodged by an incoming round. During this attack, the Marines returned fire, killing two or more attackers. During the final encounter, approximately 40 to 50 attackers, while apparently engaged in a pursuit of fighters from another faction, fired on the Marines. After the Marines returned fire, one of the attackers fired again. The Marines again returned fire, this time killing two or more attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Separately, on May 6, 1996, unknown factional forces fired upon the Embassy complex. The Marines returned fire with machine guns and automatic weapons, driving off the attackers. No U .S. forces were killed or injured in this encounter. One member of the attacking force may have been wounded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, on May 11, 1996, a U.S. Marine walking on the Embassy compound was struck by a stray round. The Marine was slightly injured. He was treated and returned to full duty. This incident was the result of stray fire between warring factions and appears not to have been directed at the Marines or the Embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Marine commander reported that during these attacks, U.S. forces opened fire only upon persons who fired upon the Embassy complex. In the judgment of U.S. military commanders, these attacks are sporadic incidents and do not represent an intent to mount a concerted or deliberate attack against the American Embassy or the Marines. We do not intend that U.S. Armed Forces deployed to Liberia become involved in hostilities. Nonetheless, our forces are equipped and prepared to defend American lives and property if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our goal is to redeploy U.S. forces once there is no longer a need for enhanced security at the Embassy and a requirement to maintain an on-scene evacuation capability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have directed the continued deployment of U.S. forces to Liberia pursuant to my constitutional authority to conduct the foreign relations of the United States and as Commander in Chief and Chief Executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am providing this report as part of my efforts to keep the Congress fully informed concerning this important deployment of U.S. forces. I appreciate the support of the Congress in this action to protect American citizens and our Embassy complex in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Briefing issued by: Office of the President on President Mandela's Visit To The Federal Republic Of Germany, May 21-23, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The visit is an opportunity to strengthen relations between South Africa and Germany, our major trading partner and one of the leading foreign investors in South Africa. In addition it should have a positive impact on relations between the regions to which our two countries belong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Germany has committed substantial resources, manpower, skills, technology and financial support towards growth and development in South Africa, and they are ready to do more. Germany is also the driving force behind closer relations between the EU and SADC states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The program for the visit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. During the three days of the visit the President will be holding talks with government as well as meeting business leaders and opposition parties. Broader engagement with the people of Germany will include an address to the Bundestag; meetings with civic leaders Bonn and Berlin; media events and the opening of a cultural exhibition on South Africa in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The formation of a high-level intergovernmental Binational Commission, to co-ordinate and deepen bilateral relations, will be a matter discussed with government. The focus of a meeting with business and investment leaders will be the launch of a &quot;Southern Africa Initiative&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> German policy towards south africa and southern africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Central to current German policy towards Africa is a commitment to assist in promoting sustainable development within a context of democracy ad human rights. Nearly two thirds of all development aid channeled to Africa is of German origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. Both government and opposition in Germany are committed to help prevent the marginalisation of South Africa and Southern Africa take root.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The Southern Africa Initiative, to be launched during the President's visit, will promote German private sector involveent in the region's economic growth ad development through trade, investment and joint ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Relations between South Africa and the European Union are strongly influenced by Germany's leading role in the EU, and Germany has been the driving force behind encouraging closer co-operation between the EU and SADC states. Half of Germany's development assistance for South Africa is in the form of its share - the biggest - of the EU's budget for South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's relations with Germany</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The consideration being given to a Binational Commission reflects the dramatic increase in bilateral relations between South Africa and Germany over the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economy relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Germany's stake in the South African economy makes it an important partner. Over 300 German firms employ 59 000 people in South Africa, and a survey by the German/South African Chamber of Commerce in late 1994 found that more than half were considering increasing their investments in South Africa. The German government is also positive about South Africa's long-term potential and the contribution it can make to the region and the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The main thrust of continued investment in South Africa originates from German firms already here, principally in the automotive and chemical industries. Most new investment enquiries also relate to the automotive industry or to tourism - reflecting South Africa's position as a principal destination for German tourists. An Investment Protection Agreement, signed when Chancellor Kohl visited South Africa last year; is expected to encourage small and medium firms to invest in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Trade between Germany and South Africa is imbalanced. German exports to SA are twice the volume of goods going the other way, and they consist primarily of high value capital equipment and finished products compared with the raw materials and semi-manufactured goods we export to Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> German development assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. German development assistance to South Africa, bilateral and via the EU, amounted to some DM 170m during 1995. Previously channeled through NGOs before South Africa had democratic government, it has now been put on a government-to-government basis through agreements signed when Chancellor Kohl visited South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The assistance is concentrated mainly on, vocational and further training; rural housing and development; small business; democracy; provincial administration; unemployment. It includes as an objective the development of Southern Africa as a region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bilateral relations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The rapid growth in bilateral relations in the past two years is reflected in the agreements that have been signed recently or soon will be.  Already agreed are provisions for investment protection and for co-operation in development; mineral and energy affairs; posts and telecommunications; and air services. Expected soon are agreements relating to culture; science and technology; financial matters; sport; and merchant shipping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. At another level, co-operation takes place through the twinning of our Provinces and German federal states. Western Cape, Gauteng and Eastern Cape have already formed such partnerships and more are being explored.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - Life is terrible for most people living with HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe. Society shuns them. For the employed, the work place is a hostile environment, thereby condemning them to the grave before they die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some victims of the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) have been kicked out of houses they were renting by their landlords soon after their HIV status is know, and sometimes property belonging to HIV positive people has been thrown out by landlords.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has driven most AIDS sufferers into silence and many victims do not tell close relatives about their HIV status until they develop full-blown AIDS, because they fear being blamed or condemned. However, a few people have come out in the open and are being used by non-governmental organisations to encourage others to live positively with the infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the HIV positive people have managed to survived for about 10 years and most of them are still going strong. Emily Shonhiwa Mazviepasi of Mutare, south-east of the capital Harare says; &quot;I knew that I was HIV positive in 1990 and I have come out in the open as a way of showing others that someone with HIV can survive for over 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Her late husband had been in and out of hospital for a very long time and finally diagnosed to have TB2. He later tested positive and died of AIDS six years ago &quot;but I am still going strong because of hope and a proper diet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 39-year-old Mazviepasi is one of the scores of HIV positive people who have come together to form the Zimbabwe National Network for People Living with HIV/AIDS (ZNNP+).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With branches and support groups nationwide and guided by the theme, &quot;Hope is Vital,&quot; ZNNP+, teaches survival techniques and how to live positively with HIV/AIDS thereby increasing the chances of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We teach that HIV stands for Hope Is Vital. It is not AIDS that kills but the despair and psychological pressure caused by lack of hope and stigmatisation. If one has the HIV virus, it does not necessarily mean that he/she has AIDS. In fact you can be a carrier of HIV for many years but without having AIDS, said leader of ZNNP+, Lynde Francis, who told participants at an AIDS reporting workshop that she had managed to survive with HIV for 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the obvious success that has been scored by ZNNP+ as more and more people join the organisation as support groups, some NGOs dealing directly or indirectly with the AIDS issue have been accused of &quot;using&quot; the infected people to enrich their pockets. Generally Zimbabwe and anywhere else</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worldwide, the majority of people with the deadly virus do not declare their status publicly and, as a result, the few that have come out were being used to give &quot;live&quot; testimonies in workshops/seminars organised ostensibly &quot;to raise money to assist them.&quot; But once donated, the money disappears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only that, some international development organisations have come up with AIDS documentaries for either &quot;research&quot; purposes or for television, promising the participants &quot;lots of money&quot; but later reneging on the promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We never get a cent and yet millions of dollars are being raised through us. We are being used and yet we are suffering,&quot; said Gertrude Usaiwevhu (37) of Zvimba communal lands, who has lived with HIV since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several NGOs had formed retail outlets in some local centres ostensibly to help people with HIV/AIDS but pocketed the earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medical doctors and church-related organisations argue that the issue of HIV/AIDS had been &quot;blown out of proportion&quot; and genuine victims were used as &quot;pawns&quot;. According to Sister Noreen Nolan of the Mashambanzou AIDS Drop-in Centre in Harare; &quot;People with HIV/AIDS are just like any other person suffering from the many diseases that exist in this world. There are lots of people with cancer or hepatitis and nobody is making an issue out of them...  I don't think those living with HIV/AIDS should be given special treatment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not all people with HIV/AIDS have learnt to live positively with the killer disease. Most HIV positive people, particularly divorcee women and housewives, blame society and the next man/woman for their status and &quot;fight back&quot; by spreading the incurable disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was divorced after I tested positive for HIV. My mother in-law chased me away saying, hatigari nemunhu ane AIDS pano (we cannot stay with a person affected by AIDS). My husband refused to go for a test saying it was my AIDS, and yet as a housewife, I never entertained any other man. At times he would sleep out for about three days...it's very infuriating indeed,&quot; said Linda Banya (26) of Mbare, now member of a cooperative at Mashambanzou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some HIV positive people admitted they were having unprotected sex with many partners without bothering to warn them of their status. &quot;Although I ask for a condom if the man insists on using it, I don't care...after all I got this disease from my former husband and was chased away in the process,&quot; said a Mbare-based 27-year-old HIV positive woman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - In a refreshing turn of events, the beleaguered Sudanese leader Omar El Bashir, has told Islamic radicals and fundamentalists using Sudanese territory to wage war against neighbouring countries to leave Sudan &quot;immediately.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan's neighbours, particularly Egypt, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Eritrea, as well as others further afield like Saudi Arabia, have regularly accused the National Islamic Front (NIF), who are the real rulers of Sudan, of sponsoring and condoning the activities of terrorist organisations bent on destabilising their nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt and the United States engineered the limited United Nations sanctions against Sudan that became effective on May 12. Both countries say Sudan has for a number of years operated secret camps where foreigners train as assassins. One such camp, at El Haj Yussef, is believed to have been the training base for the Egyptian militants who attempted to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia mid last year. The UN security council's limited sanctions against Sudanese diplomats is in response to the failure by Sudan to hand over some of the people who were allegedly involved in the abortive attack on Mubarak.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> El Bashir has also come under increased military pressure from his aggrieved neighbours - Uganda, Eritrea and Ethiopia. Each of these nations has a bone to pick with Sudan which lacks the financial resources to cope with a sustained military campaign against the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> El Bashir's order against all dissidents using Sudan last week said; &quot;Everyone who has activities against his government or another government and who lives in Sudan, must leave immediately.&quot; The order was reported by the Arabic language Al Wasat, generally accepted as reliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> El Bashir must be particularly worried about Eritrea, its neighbour to the east. Eritrea has made it quite clear that it has opened up training camps on its territory for the benefit of the Opposition Alliance whose aim is to overthrow the NIF regime in Khartoum. The Opposition Alliance used their base camps in Eritrea last month to launch a &quot;successful&quot; military operation against a Sudanese garrison in the Kassala area of north-eastern Sudan. They are led by a professional soldier, formerly in the Sudanese Army, Abdel Aziz Osman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eritrean President Isaias Aferworki said in an interview recently that by his own estimation, the regime in Khartoum is very weak. &quot;The morale of the military is very low and the logistical support for their fighting men inadequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He doubted Sudan had a capacity to take on Eritrea in a direct military confrontation and dismissed Sudan's much touted 1 million strong militia, saying it was not a credible military force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers say the &quot;successful&quot; operation by the Opposition Alliance forces in Kassala last April must have badly unnerved the regime in Khartoum because the region east of Khartoum is Sudan's breadbasket. Colonel Osman said the military garrison fell in less than one hour, &quot;proving that the NIF regime is supported by a very weak military.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia is another neighbour of Sudan which is angered by the Khartoum regime's brazen disregard for the territorial integrity of a neighbour.  Ethiopia blames Sudan for the abortive attempt on the life of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt last year as the President arrived for an Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations have deteriorated considerably. Last February, Sudan accused Ethiopia of allowing the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) of John Garang to use military bases in Ethiopia to launch a quick attack on Sudanese garrison towns in Upper Nile and Blue Nile regions. Sudan said Ethiopian tanks had actively taken part in those attacks, a charge denied by the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan's neighbour to the south, Uganda, has a more serious problem with rebels said to be supported by Khartoum. Following his landslide victory in the presidential elections on May 9, President Yoweri Museveni warned Bashir he would not kneel down to him. He charged that Sudan was using guerrillas of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) who have committed numerous atrocities in northern Uganda, to further its islamic fundamentalist ambitions in the East African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most people do not understand the international dimension of the rebellion in the north. Uganda's misfortune to share a border with a neighbour who sees us as a frontier to further fundamentalist incursion into the rest of Africa,&quot; said the victorious Museveni at his swearing in ceremony on May 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni warned Bashir to withdraw support from the rebels and pull them back to an internationally monitored holding facility near Juba or face the consequences. One implication of Museveni's tough talking is that Uganda would reserve the right to offer much greater support to the rebels of the SPLA. Sudan has regularly charged that Uganda is the SPLA's biggest backer in recent times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers believe that with El Bashir's decree requiring rebel movements to leave Sudan, the days of the Lord's Resistance Army in Gulu and Kitgum Districts of northern Uganda are numbered. Similarly the West Nile Bank Front of Juma Oris are likely to disintegrate since both guerrilla organisations cannot be sustained internally in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the Uganda rebel groups appear to have anticipated Bashir's decree, which caused them to declare a ceasefire in early May. The rebels of the LRA desperately wanted Ugandan presidential loser Paul Ssemogerere to win the elections in Uganda, hence their door-to-door campaigns for him in the last days before the elections. Museveni lost badly in the West Nile, Gulu, and Kitgum areas of northern Uganda where he obtained an average of 10 per cent of the votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was attributed to the activities of the rebels who promised the people that peace would return to Uganda upon the defeat of Museveni.  Ssemogerere promised the rebels that he would negotiate with them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kampala - Uganda presidential poll is over and this East African country has a new national chief executive, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. Contrary to earlier predictions that Museveni would win only a marginal victory, he got an overwhelming majority.<BR> Museveni garnered 74.2 per cent of the valid votes. His closest rival, veteran politician Dr. Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere of the Inter-Political Forces Cooperation (IPFC) or simply IPC, obtained 23.7 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political upstart, Mohammed Kibirige Mayanja, 46, a University administrator and education planner polled a poor 2.1 per cent. Of the 6.2 million votes cast, only 196,130 ballot papers or 3.2 per cent were invalidated. An impressive 75 per cent of the registered voters turned out to cast their vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni won in 32 districts out of the country's 39, which included the eight districts in Ssemogerere's (and Mayanja's) home region, Buganda in central Uganda. The region had the highest number of registered voters as well as votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ssemogerere, 64, overwhelmed Museveni, 52, in the remaining seven districts mainly in parts of Eastern Uganda and in the North, whose discredited hold on power and the army Museveni almost single- handedly terminated in 1986 when he shot his way into power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni banned partisan political activity but not political parties, in favour of what has been characterised as a &quot;home grown movement style of democracy.&quot; Under the system individual rather than partisan participation is the principle modus operandi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also pledged that his ascendancy to the pinnacle of power was not simply a &quot;change of guard&quot; but a transformation that would usher in fundamental changes. These would include the return of &quot;power to the people&quot; and the restoration of democratic governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Constitutional Commission set up in 1992 to collect views on an appropriate future constitutional text, subsequently saw the enactment in late 1995 of constitution by a Constituent Assembly comprising directly elected representatives who arguably embodied every shade of opinion in the country. The new constitution incorporates the ban on partisan political activity, a matter that is to be subjected to a national referendum in the year 2001.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next most important step in the process was the presidential race of May 9, 1996 that Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has just won. This will be followed by parliamentary and local government authorities elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite protests and accusations of vote-rigging and other malpractices by the vanquished candidates, diplomats, monitors, local and foreign observers, and the Uganda Joint Christian Council (UJCC) have endorsed the results. According to press reports, polling agents of the losers at nearly all the 15,567 polling stations, have also endorsed the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike the first ever post-independence (October 1962) multi-party polls of December 1980, only one ballot box was used this time. The empty boxes were opened, inspected and sealed in the presence of monitors, voters present, observers and local candidates' polling agents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ballot papers were marked in secret and the vote was actually cast in the open, unlike 1980 when open vote-casting was not used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also in 1980, the counting and verification was not done at the respective local polling stations. Instead, ballot boxes were transported all the way to the capital, Kampala by &quot;official&quot; election organisers for counting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The arrangements for the May 1996 presidential elections made rigging of an opponent's votes or stashing of rigged votes in a candidate's favour difficult. This explains why candidates' polling agents promptly and with much ease endorsed the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this background, diplomats, monitors, local and foreign observers also quickly endorsed the results. The Italian envoy in Kampala, Marcello Ricoveri, termed the losers protests &quot;the usual complaints.&quot; Italy currently holds the presidency of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The opposition has complained extensively about a lot of things - their usual complaints, but from what I have seen and heard, the elections have been fair.&quot; Noting isolated incidents of poor administration by the Interim Electoral Commission and bias by some election officials, he said: &quot;All the same I don't see how the opposition can claim rigging as a reason for loss of the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving its verdict, the National Organisation of Civic Education and Election Monitoring (NOCEM), an independent coalition of 12 voluntary NGOs said: &quot;In spite of the shortcomings pointed out above, the results to a great extent reflected the will of the people of Uganda which should be respected by all.&quot; The coalition includes among others, The Uganda Law Society, the national journalists association and human rights groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Except for the partisan (pro-Museveni) conduct of local administration officials, the short comings listed by NOCEM do not seem serious enough to affect the overall results. By and large the shortcomings bordered more on administrative lapses, ineptitude and clumsiness rather than deliberate dishonesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, in the insurgency infested areas in Northern Uganda where soldiers of the Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) formerly NRA were heavily deployed, Museveni lost miserably. This tends to obliterate the accusation that voters were intimidated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand evidence abounds that both camps intimidated each others supports, but most likely with no official sanction. Violence and unsavory language were equally perpetrated by both camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another verdict the 100-strong International Observer Group said that during the elections, they saw very few cases of intimidation or efforts to influence voters in the vicinity of polling stations. The result reflected the polling process which they observed on election day, they declared in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Overall, the International Observer Group believes that the procedures of the poll were carried out in a transparent manner and in accordance with the Interim Election Statute,&quot; the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, &quot;the monitors did not rule on whether they considered the election free and fair, apparently because of Museveni's ban on political parties operating which means Uganda's political system falls short of Western-style democracy,&quot; reported the semi-Government daily news paper, The New Vision. But the opposition is not impressed and is now threatening to boycott the forthcoming parliamentary poll scheduled for June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of the just-concluded presidential race, it is generally believed that intimidation, vote-rigging, and malpractices in general were not really the issues that are responsible for Ssemogerere's poor showing.  Reasons for the heavy loss of the otherwise formidable opposition candidate, Dr. Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere must be found elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ssemogerere was formidable if for nothing else because he was a joint candidate of the two oldest existing and well-established political parties: the Democratic Party which he leads, and Uganda People's Congress (UPC) whose leader technically is still the discredited Dr. Apollo Milton Obote who now lives in exile in Zambia. This &quot;unholy alliance of documented bitter enemies&quot; cost the opposition several votes especially in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of Buganda, Ssemogerere lost additional votes when he unwittingly singled out Ugandans of Rwandese extraction for &quot;unbecoming utterances, intimidation and innuendos.&quot; Similar utterances by Obote in the early 80s prompted many Banyarwanda to join Museveni's rebel army in the bush in droves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In retrospect, observes a Ugandan lawyer who is a political activist, it is largely the Banyarwanda, one of whom is Ssemogerere's own Legal Advisor and Deputy National Chairman, that makes Ugandan nationality a sensitive issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, nearly one third of Buganda's population of about 4.5 million people comprises indigenous Banyarwanda (and their cousins in Western Uganda) and people who pass as Baganda but actually carry Banyarwanda and other blood. Some of these people's ancestors arrived in Buganda (and Uganda) in mid-1800s to meet a manual labour shortage and their contribution to the Buganda economy especially, is not any less important than the African-American's contributions to the economy of the United States of America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, Museveni used his incumbency and the State machinery at his disposal as well as his miraculous track record to maximum advantage.  For example, he gave favours and privileges, though well in advance of the elections, where he rightly predicted votes would later matter as in the case of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition failed to offer anything to counter Museveni's socio- political and economic performance in a country and populace that past regimes had thrown to the dogs for nearly a quarter century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, in the eyes of many voters, the opposition sounded dim- witted, theatrical and only interested in entering State House each time it tried, but unconvincingly, to ridicule the National Resistance Movement (NRM) Government's track record. Ssemogerere himself served in the NRM Government for nine years resigning only last year to contest the Presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Museveni's campaign team must also be given due credit. While Ssemogerere was in carnival showing off his new-found big-wig friends in the opposition alliance wherever he went, Museveni's big shots were busy campaigning door to door in the respective home areas. The team was most creative, going as far as using television, radio and print media adverts for the first time ever in a Ugandan election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team left nothing to chance. For purposes of the elections, the team chose to adopt and to give to the Interim Electoral Commission Museveni's less-used name, Kaguta, as the candidate's first name. In the alphabet order by which the candidates names and pictures were arranged on the ballot papers, Kaguta comes first as opposed to the other two candidates' names.  With hind sight to the illiteracy rates in their motherland, the team new that a picture coming on top could be advantageous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Electoral Commission was accused of announcing 700 new polling stations on the eve of the elections for which it was impractical for the opposition to appoint polling agents. This is an accusation that could stick if only the opposition also provided particulars of these polling stations, including among other things, the names of officials who manned them and the total number of votes cast at the stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition will therefore need more than unsubstantiated allegations to take the big prize away from the guerrilla marshal- turned civilian leader, Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, the man supporters and adversaries alike love to hate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Rev. Peter Njenga, the Provost of All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi was on May 11 elected the fourth Bishop of Mt. Kenya South Diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Bishop will be consecrated on June 30, 1996 at St. James Cathedral, Kiambu, some 25 kilometres north of here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Dean of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) the Rt. Rev. Dr.  David Gitari announced Njenga's election at St. Peter's Church, Ol Kalau, about 130 kilometres north-west of here the same day, just before delivering the sermon during the funeral of the late Bishop Laadan Kamau, the former Bishop of the Diocese of Nakuru who retired in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said the Acting Archbishop of the CPK; &quot;As we bury our beloved Bishop Laadan Kamau, a new bishop has been &quot;born on this same day.&quot; There was much jubilation from the mourners on learning that the Provost of All Saints Cathedral has become the Bishop of Mt. Kenya South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rev. Peter Njenga joined the Church Army Training College in January 1962 and completed his studies of evangelism in November 1963. He was commissioned a Church Army Captain on November 30, 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After serving as an evangelist for a number of years he joined St.  Paul's United Theological College in 1968 and was awarded a Diploma in Theology from the University of Makerere in 1971. He proceeded to St. John's Nottingham Seminary in 1974 to study theology and was awarded a Bachelor of Theology Degree after successful completion of the course in July 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After serving in a number of parishes in Mt. Kenya South Diocese, he was inducted and installed as the Provost of All Saints Cathedral, Nairobi on February 27, 1983. He has served as the Provost of the Cathedral for 13 years. His stay at the Cathedral has been greatly appreciated and admired for his courage and prophetic ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provost Njenga who shed tears of joy on being declared the new bishop, is best remembered for a war of words with the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party officials following the brutal evictions of slum dwellers in Muoroto village which is within his Cathedral parish. According to Njenga, the 1990 eviction claimed seven lives but establishment politicians vehemently denied this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mt. Kenya South diocesan Chancellor Mr. Githu Muigai, described the elections as very peaceful and &quot;very, very spiritually conducted. There was no politicking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reporters and spectators were kept out of the cathedral during the elections. The cathedral resounded with claps and later prayers when the winner was announced. Rev. Njenga got 88 votes against his closest rival Rev.  David Njoroge who garnered 68 votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his consecration he will become the fourth Bishop of Mt. Kenya South.  His predecessors include the late Bishop Obadiah Kariuki, the late Bishop Sospeter Magua and the recently retired Bishop George Njuguna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Njuguna who was retired in public interest following allegations of moral misconduct and misappropriation of church funds, has predicted violence in the diocese saying there will now be two bishops in the see. But so far indications are that there might be peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Geneva - The World Council of Churches (WCC) and the Lutheran World Federation (LWF) have issued a joint appeal for $794,000 to provide emergency services to suffering Liberians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The appeal was sent out early this month by Action by Churches Together (ACT), a worldwide network of churches and their related agencies instituted by both WCC and LWF in 1995 to respond to human need through coordinated emergency response and common identity.<BR> The ACT Executive Secretary, Mr. Hugh MCcullum, expressed hope that ecumenical partners will act swiftly to the appeal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Escalated fighting began in Liberia's capital, Monrovia on April 6, sending civilians scampering for safety outside the capital as well as into neighbouring countries. The West African country has been ravaged by civil war since late 1989, and numerous efforts to bring warring factions to an amicable accord have proved futile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The situation that has seen many Liberians flee their country, calls for urgent action and it is our hope that the ecumenical partners will act swiftly to the issue at hand,&quot; said McCullum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that the appeal will follow another one of US dollars 100,000 for the Christian Council of Ghana. &quot;The decision was taken today (May 15) after receiving information that the ship carrying hundreds of Liberian refugees has been allowed to dock at Takoradi, Ghana by the Ghanaian authorities,&quot; McCullum added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ACT Executive Secretary said the present appeal comes after an earlier one of US dollars 500,000 on April 18. The appeal mid-last month was meant to be used to equip the ACT/LWF office in Abidjan, Ivory Coast following recent losses in Liberial's capital. It would also help stockpile medicines and other relief goods, ready for transport to the small west African country, currently facing serious civil war as a result of renewed fighting between various factions mainly in the capital Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the General Secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), Rev. Jose Chipenda says churches in Africa are faced with another challenge in the wake of the current crisis in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is sad that a crisis should surface in Liberia now, not long after similar ones in Rwanda and Burundi. The churches on the continent have no choice but to face the challenge as the situation demands,&quot; he told APS in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chipenda said the AACC is currently liaising with international ecumenical partners and local churches within countries neighbouring Liberia in order to give the crisis the attention it deserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Chipenda also briefed APS on the May 5 to 9 meeting of the Fellowship of Councils of Churches in Eastern and Southern Africa (FOCCESA), which took place in Maputo, Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said delegates drawn from the two regions strongly felt that &quot;the church should continue to respond to emergencies unreservedly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FOCCESA also welcomed the recent decision by the AACC to decentralise its refugee and emergency services. Similar committees for Western and Central Africa are being established, noted the AACC General Secretary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Kampala - The Uganda Joint Christian Council (UJCC) which monitored the May 9 presidential poll in Uganda, has urged opposition leaders Dr. Paul Ssemogerere and Mr. Mohammed Mayanja to concede defeat gracefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report published on May 14, the UJCC noted that despite some shortcomings and some anomalies in the election process, the whole exercise was a fair and authentic representation of the views and aspirations of Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the presidential poll, the incumbent won a landslide victory scoring 74.2 per cent of the popular vote out of the 6.2 million votes cast in Uganda's first election in 16 years. His main challenger Dr. Paul Ssemogerere managed 23.8 per cent while less than two per cent went to Mr. Mayanja.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UJCC statement was signed by its chairperson Emmanuel Cardinal Wamala and its coordinator Rev. Canon James Ndyabahika.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UJCC urged the victor, Yoweri Museveni to show magnamity and statesmanship by extending the hand of cooperation to all those who challenged him or did not vote for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As UJCC released their statement, Dr. Ssemogerere's Inter Party Political Forces Cooperation (IPFC) met all day on May 14 to consider a boycott of the parliamentary elections due in June. Ssemogerere has charged that there was extensive rigging in the presidential poll but international and local observers have dismissed his claims, saying the Uganda elections were a wholly transparent exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ssemogerere was defeated by Museveni in his birthplace, Kalangangala in the Ssese Islands and in Masaka District where he resides. Observers believe he is on his way out as a politician.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Ssemogerere is boycotting the parliamentary polls, many of his colleagues say they will participate in the elections, warning that to fail to do so would allow Museveni to have absolute control of the affairs of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement issued by the IPFC after the meeting on May 14 said: &quot;Any Ugandan wishing to participate in the forthcoming parliamentary elections may do so well knowing that the rigging machinery is still in place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, following his colourful swearing in on May 12 that was witnessed by five regional presidents, President Museveni promised to work with some &quot;good elements&quot; in the opposition but ruled out reconciliation with Ssemogerere, whom he called &quot;a traitor.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 10,000 people have died since RUF leader Foday Sankoh launched his rebellion in March 1991 against Sierra Leone's now-defunct one- party state, and around half of Sierra Leone's 4.5 million people have fled the devastated country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ivory Coast has sponsored peace talks since April 24 between the rebel fighters and the new government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, formed after elections in February and March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Essy said committees were on May 15 continuing to discuss practical measures such as disarmament and the rebels' return to normal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ivorian Foreign Minister warned, however, that the two sides did not share the &quot;same philosophical approach to this peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankoh has yet to recognise the legitimacy of Kabbah, Sierra Leone's first democratically elected chief executive in three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebel leader vehemently opposed the elections, claiming that the civil war prevented most people from voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the April talks Sankoh never used the words &quot;president&quot; or &quot;government&quot;, preferring instead to speak of his &quot;brothers on the other side of the table.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankoh first called a ceasefire on March 17, the day Kabbah was voted into office, and attended it on April 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> News of the agreement came only six days after Sierra Leonean state radio alleged that more than 100 civilians had been killed by rebels in southern Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;massacre&quot; at Bendu-Malen in the Pujehun district on May 6 was reported by local hunters who returned from Bendu-Malen where they had been monitoring the current ceasefire between the government and RUF rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting journalists in the area, the radio said most victims were between 50 and 75 years old, while teenage captives were taken to the main rebel base Camp Libya in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One journalist who accompanied the hunters said children under five years were abandoned by the rebels who later moved on to Mattru near Jimmy Bagbor chiefdom also in the south where 16 other civilians were beaten to death by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A promised government statement on the incident did not materialise, with observers believing that it could have been withheld in order not to jeopardise the peace negotiations in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However by the time of going to press, the RUF leader denied having heard about the agreement to a final ceasefire. He said although he was not a member of the delegation at the peace talks, he would have been informed about the agreement and the RUF would have to make a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he was reported saying; &quot;I am not saying that the Ivorian Minister was lying about this agreement....We are still negotiating.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Takoradi, Ghana - Thousands of desperate Liberian refugees left a rusty and leaking freighter at this Ghanaian port on May 14 after more than a week at sea in appalling conditions, as the captain said he had been forced to take them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana, which turned the ship away on May 13 after letting it dock briefly, finally gave permission for the &quot;Bulk Challenge&quot; to discharge its human cargo after the United Nations and the European Union promised aid for the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian-registered ship, packed with more than 3,000 refugees fleeing fighting in war-torn Liberia, had been turned away several times from other west African ports as well since it left Monrovia on May 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the ship roamed the sea with conditions worsening on board, international pressure mounted on West African states to take in the refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva said the first refugees headed for a reception centre in the village of Essipong, 10 kilometres from the port, which lies some 200 kilometres south-west of the capital, Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The freighter's captain, Roland Pudie, said late on May 14 that he was &quot;forced&quot; by West African peacekeepers in Liberia to embark his passengers in Monrovia port and vowed that he will &quot;never, never convey passengers on my cargo vessel again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he had been hired by another Nigerian, Tom Ipawe, to &quot;convey cargo from Monrovia to San Pedro,&quot; but at Monrovia, ECOMOG &quot;forced&quot; him to take the passengers, desperate to escape the factional bloodshed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sierra Leone, meanwhile, a second ship, the Victory Reefer carrying almost 1,500 refugees fleeing Liberia, docked in Freetown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ship had been anchored off Freetown since May 12 and aid agencies had warned of a humanitarian disaster if the refugees were not helped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, authorities there maintained only Sierra Leone nationals, who were the majority on board, would be allowed off the ship, with a port official saying he did not know what would happen to the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees ordeal came amid reports of new heavy fighting in Monrovia, which left at least 15 fighters dead on May 14, as rival militias renewed efforts to increase their areas of control in the Liberian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the dead were gunmen of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), butchered with bayonets and lances by fighters of several factions dominated by the rival Krahn ethnic group. NPFL fighters, however, said they had killed 27 Krahns, but this could not be confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the fiercest battles took place around the Greystone compound, a makeshift home for some 20,000 Monrovians displaced by the six-year civil war in the west African country. The compound is just yards from the United States Embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Krahns had earlier advanced into the NPFL-controlled area around Greystone by passing themselves off as factional allies of the NPFL - - there is little to distinguish one militia from another as only the most senior officers wear uniforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The May 14 clashes broke out between 4:00 a.m and 5:00 a.m. (0400 and 0500 GMT) after an NPFL assault was met with a powerful counter- attack by the Krahns, who pushed the NPFL back past the United States Embassy, towards the Greystone compound, looting as they advanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heavy fighting was also reported on the morning of May 14 on two bridges linking the city to Bushrod Island, site of Monrovia's freeport and several hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bridges are the only access routes available to aid agencies delivering water, food and medical supplies into the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The renewed clashes followed two days of relative calm in Monrovia, where on May 13 residents had begun to return to the streets to assess the damage to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On several occasions on May 13, &quot;generals&quot; from rival factions had put down their guns to negotiate small scale cease-fires with their opposite numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recent unrest in Monrovia broke out on April 6 when &quot;government forces&quot; loyal to Taylor and his fellow member of Liberia's interim council of state, Alhaji Kromah, tried to arrest Krahn faction leader &quot;General&quot; Roosevelt Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armed Johnson loyalists clashed with the &quot;government forces&quot; and within a day, fighting and violent looting had spread to much of the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Churches have been challenged to exploit the increasing popularity of radio among local communities in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prof. Stephen Talitwala, the vice chancellor of Kenya's Daystar University told guests at a dinner organised by leading Christian radio stations here; &quot;We should not at this juncture spend more time discussing the impact of radio as a means of communication among local communities in Africa, for it is already there and is being effectively felt. Our concern now should be how effectively churches can exploit radio for evangelisation among such communities.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The May 10 dinner was organised jointly by the Trans World Radio (TWR) and the Far East Broadcasting Association (FEBA). Both Christian broadcasting radio stations beam to Africa from Manzini, Swaziland and Seychelles, on the Indian Ocean island off the East African coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guests who included clergy and Christian communicators based their discussion on the theme; &quot;God Speaks Through Radio&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing the impact of radio as a means of communication in comparison to television and print media, Prof. Talitwala noted that in Kenya, for example, there are 3 million radio sets, representing 13 radios for every 100 persons, compared to only 250,000 television sets, or one for every 100 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Prof. Talitwala, the print media isolate the majority of Africa's population, who can neither read nor write. &quot;In this regard, the power of radio is unmatched when measured against these other media,&quot; he emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he cautioned the Church in Africa, that it will have to invest heavily in training of personnel, establishment of and equipping communications centres in order to realise this goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Kwame Rubadiri, National Director for Trans World Radio noted that while his organisation has enough funds to run radio programmes on Short Wave, churches should give financial support to enable TWR air such programmes on national radio stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is one thing to be heard on our shortwave, but another to relay our programmes on the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation (KBC), for example,&quot; said Mr. Simba Lombo, the FEBA Coordinator for East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to some estimates, Neno, a TWR production aired five days a week through KBC, costs nearly Kshs.900,000 (about US dollars 15,790) per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the guests, a Nairobi lawyer, Fred Ojiambo, called on African Christians to wake up to the realisation that &quot;God is in dire need to see them committing their resources for His good work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pauline Ngunjiri, who is currently coordinating promotion for TWR among churches and clergy in Africa, said the dinner was part of that campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leah Gachegu, the Audience Relations Manager for FEBA, said the idea of selling the good name of FEBA and TWR among churches and their clergy in Africa is central to the propagation of the Christian ministry through radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TWR which beams its religious programmes from Manzini, Swaziland, broadcasts in 25 African languages, while its Kiswahili broadcasts reach some 42 million Africans in East and Southern Africa namely Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. &quot;Many of them are Muslims, and radio is their only contact with the gospel,&quot; says a TWR brochure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FEBA beams religious programmes for Africa from the Seychelles on the Indian Ocean. It broadcasts in 43 languages. Its Kiswahili programmes benefit Christians in the East and Central African countries of Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council has of late increased its efforts towards selling family planning concepts to disabled persons in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although previous calls for family planning programmes for the disabled went unheeded, the ZNFPC has now stepped up its efforts through government, non-governmental organisations and the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Preference for large families is still high especially in rural areas.  The blind people are the most affected,&quot; said ZNFPC's programmes and Communications Manager, Mr. Godfrey Tinarwo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The population of the disabled parents is increasing at an alarming rate and yet most disabled parents are poor, illiterate, unemployed and underprivileged. These social problems are making it difficult for the parents to sustain their large families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts by the ZNFPC are expected to improve the current sad state of affairs. Urban centres are common sights of children of disabled parents who roam the streets begging and even demanding money from passers-by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, before the government, NGOs and the public can come up with suitable project proposals, the disabled society should understand the importance of smaller families which are easier to sustain, taking into account the current high cost of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Tinarwo said it was wrong to blame the disabled persons for their desire for large families. &quot;Research has shown that for long, the disabled society has not had access to family planning information. Some disabled persons live in remote parts of the country,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In November 1994, organisations representing disabled people held a congress in Victoria Falls to identify and discuss problems affecting them in relation to family planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, the ZNFPC has been working closely with care organisations dealing with the disabled. More workshops, seminars and meetings took place to enhance efforts towards the achievement of dissemination of family planning literature to members of the society who are disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We now produce special family planning literature for the disabled people including braille for the blind. We even use the media to reach many people,&quot; noted Tinarwo. According to Mr. Tinarwo, ZNFPC is going to use such promotion strategies as door to door lectures, distribution of pamphlets, use of braille and sign language for the blind and deaf respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are also going to distribute posters of disabled persons who have successfully used family planning as well as training some of them who will go out to benefit their colleagues,&quot; Tinarwo added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ludzidzini, Swaziland - King Mswati III has relented to political pressures from his subjects and announced some constitutional changes in his kingdom, But critics said these did not go far enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Swazi monarch, who has been ruling his country by decree, kicked off the reforms by announcing on May 8 the sacking of the 74-year-old Prime Minister Mbilini Dlamini with immediate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have decided to retire grandfather Prince Dlamini because, like in a relay, the one who fades needs to be replaced,&quot; the Swazi monarch said, without giving reasons for replacing the Prime Minister, who had held the post since 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mswati also announced that he had set up a people's Parliament at Ludzidzini, 80 kilometres south of the capital Mbabane, which would start hearing constitutional submissions by ordinary Swazis from May 9.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two advisory bodies, a Constitutional Committee and the Swaziland National Council, will also be set up from May 9, Mswati said, without elaborating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Ketumile Masire of Botswana, had been designated by the king to attend the first session of the People's Parliament, but a spokesman for Mandela in Pretoria denied the president would be visiting South Africa's tiny neighbour in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, political and trade union leaders left the May 8 meeting in disgust after it became apparent that Mswati, who has absolute authority over his 900,000 subjects, had no intention of lifting a 1973 decree which bans political activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) secretary-general Jan Sithole described Mbilini's sacking as &quot;window dressing.&quot; He said only the lifting of the 1973 royal decree -- made by King Sobusa II, Mswati's father -- would solve the country's problems. Sacking Mbilini, he added, was like &quot;changing the bottle top of a Coca Cola bottle and then telling people it is Fanta.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his budget speech in April, the monarch promised an overhaul of the country's constitution, saying it had to be &quot;reviewed like a car which needs to be serviced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition political parties who have formed the Swaziland Democratic Alliance (SDA) have joined the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions in demanding political reforms and an end to a state of emergency imposed in 1973 by Mswati's father, King Sobusa II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alliance members and SFTU leaders said they would hold urgent talks to discuss the implications of Mswati's statements. Last January, unprecedented demonstrations called by the SFTU, coupled with a crippling civil service strike, paralysed the country, sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leaders of the two groups have warned of further industrial action if political reforms are not forthcoming. But the new move was immediately lauded by President Ketumile Masire of Botswana and South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo, who paid brief visits to Swaziland on May 9 to endorse a new political initiative by the Swazi king.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their visit to the Lobamba Royal Kraal at his Ludzidzini village, 80 kilometres south of the capital, coincided with the first day's proceedings in a &quot;People's Parliament,&quot; set up here by Mswati in response to demands for political reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 4,000 Swazis turned up for the &quot;parliament&quot;, a series of consultative public meetings between residents and government leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Masire, who with his counterparts from South Africa and Zimbabwe, Nelson Mandela and Robert Mugabe, has been pressurizing the monarch to end his absolute rule in the tiny southern African country, said he was &quot;delighted&quot; at the new initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Change is inevitable and change will come, but change must not control you, you must manage change. We are delighted at this exercise. We believe it will bear good fruits for the future of your country,&quot; Masire told the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo, who apologised for Mandela's inability to attend the meeting, stressed the need for peaceful negotiated reform in Swaziland and declared: &quot;It is heartening to see this type of imbizo (gathering) where people are peacefully working to adopt a long-lasting democratic solution to Swaziland's problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Speaking from our experience in South Africa, you must find a solution which will peacefully encompass all the differing opinions and views in Swaziland,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy chairman Alex Boraine, was reported by the South African Press Agency (SAPA), as saying that the commission hoped to present an interim report to Mandela by June, which &quot;will include our preliminary views on the testimony that has come before us.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The closure of the four-day Durban sitting on May 10, signalled the end of the commission's largely symbolic first round of hearings launched in mid-April and heard in East London in the Eastern Cape province, Cape Town, Johannesburg and here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission has heard more than 140 cases of police brutality, political assassinations, disappearances, abductions, torture and deaths in detention spanning three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the hearings on May 10, one of South Africa's most colourful and controversial political figures accused senior members of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) of human rights abuses during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pat Hlongwane, whose political career has taken him from the black liberation movements to the white right-wing, told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission here how he had been beaten, jailed and driven underground by the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The testimony was received with skepticism and amusement by the audience, and Hlongwane himself at one point turned around to face the crowd, flashed a toothless grin and cackled mischievously, drawing further laughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In general, the allegations raised at the commission were deadly serious, and Tutu, who was often moved to tears during the hearings, told a media briefing on May 10 that he had been stunned by the &quot;depths of depravity&quot; which had emerged in testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he had also been struck by the willingness of victims to forgive their torturers and captors, as well as their refusal to &quot;buckle under intense suffering, brutality and intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are realising we can transcend the conflict of the past. It gives me great hope for this beautiful land. We believe it is possible for our country to be healed and for us to close the door on this dark past so that blacks and whites, coloureds and Indians may be able to go forth together into this glorious future that God holds out before us,&quot; said the Cape Town Archbishop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Archbishop Tutu said the commission wanted to hear as many people as possible over the next 18 months to two years, but there was clearly not enough time for everyone to appear before the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In future, smaller hearings will be held with only one commissioner and possibly a member of the commission's human rights violations committee in attendance, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cairo - Egypt is to host an international conference in July on the threat posed by religious fundamentalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The July 24 conference, sponsored by the highest Sunni Muslim authority in Egypt, Al-Azhar, will group Muslim clerics, experts and Arab officials, says Mohammed Ibrahim al-Fayumi of Egypt's Ministry of Waqf or Religious Property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said late April that the meeting would focus on the &quot;phenomenon of international terrorism&quot; arising from fundamentalism and &quot;the position of Islam and other religions towards religious extremism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fayumi, quoted by the government daily Al-Akhbar, added: &quot;All the Waqf and Islamic Affairs ministries from Arab and Muslim countries, more than 40 muftis as well as many academics from 200 countries or international organisations will take part.&quot; Eastern experts from European countries, former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and representatives of Muslim minorities in countries such as Bosnia, Chechnya and the United States will also attend the forum in the Egyptian capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sheikh of Al-Azhar, Sheikh Mohammad Sayed Tantawi, called for such a conference last December to &quot;show the world the true face of Islam which rejects violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest announcement comes shortly after the massacre on April 18 of Greek tourists at a Cairo hotel had uncovered an extensive Islamic fundamentalist influence, building up quietly in the slums at the foot of the country's famed Giza pyramids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government press warned on April 29 that the Talbiya neighbourhood had become a &quot;new Imbaba&quot;, referring to the north Cairo slum which armed militants controlled until a massive police invasion dislodged them in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of fundamentalist sympathizers have been arrested in Talbiya since the slaughter at the nearby Europa hotel, when gunmen mowed down a Greek tour group, killing 18, in the country's worst ever anti-tourist attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Jamaa Islamiyya (Islamic Group), Egypt's main armed extremist group, claimed responsibility for the attack, sparking fears of a revival of violence after police claimed it had broken the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But police and inhabitants of Talbiya say that although fundamentalism has made inroads into the large slum in southeast Cairo, it has &quot;nothing to do&quot; with more extreme violent groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talbiya, just five kilometres from the pyramids, is one of the &quot;unplanned areas&quot; that sprung up without authorization around Cairo in the 1980s. Most of its 100,000 residents have electricity and water, but few of the roads in its maze of alleys are paved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like elsewhere in Cairo, many women wear the Muslim veils covering their hair. However the more fundamentalist &quot;niqab,&quot; the black shroud covering the whole face except for the eyes, is also frequent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two non-violent Islamic groups -- the Pakistan-based Tabligh wal- Daawa (Call and Preaching) and the Salafiya, a reform movement born in Egypt in the late 19th century -- have a strong presence in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their influence spread in Talbiya under the view of authorities who have judged them &quot;not a danger at the present time,&quot; a police source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the groups, which have no legal status, are under intense surveillance, &quot;because theoretically it is easier for the Jamaa or Muslim Brotherhood to recruit among regular citizens,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authorities accuse the Muslim Brotherhood of links to armed groups even though the banned organisation claims it has renounced violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A police station is to be opened in the slum for the first time while residents said a survey began on April 26 to pinpoint fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no presence here of the Jamaa or the Muslim Brotherhood,&quot; said a Tabligh wal-Daawa sympathiser, who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our religious lessons at the Al-Rahma mosque (across the street from the Europa hotel) have been forbidden since the attack, but freedom will return once the attackers are arrested,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We only remind Muslims of their religious duties without entering politics, and we offer social services,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most Talbiya residents praised the groups. &quot;They help the poor with charity given by the rich. They support schools and just rented a boarding house for a widow. They are very polite and ask for nothing in return,&quot; a local carpenter said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the government weekly Akhbar al-Hawadith warned that Talbiya was a &quot;time bomb&quot; and &quot;a base for drug dealers and terrorists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nobody knows what goes on there and those responsible for several attacks have found refuge there,&quot; the weekly Rose al-Yusef said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt has been battling a violent anti-government campaign by Muslim militants that has cost more than 1000 lives since March 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The following is the text of the opening address by South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to the to the Information<BR>Society and Development (ISAD) Conference in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Santer, Honourable Ministers and Commissioners Your Excellencies Ambassadors, Heads of Delegation and Representative of International and Regional Organisations Ladies and Gentlemen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am honoured to convey the greetings and best wishes of our President Nelson Mandela who also asked us to extend, the very warm welcome of the people of South Africa to all participants to this Conference, and especially to those who come here from far away lands. Welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some wishes do get realised! Fifteen months ago, addressing the G7 Conference on the Information Society in Brussels, we asserted that entry into the Information Society should not be reserved for the G7 members and other Developed countries, and that the debate about the information society is indeed of relevance to all humanity. On that occasion, we proposed that the G7 initiative therefore be broadened to include a wide cross-section of developed and developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thanks to the determination and endurance of President Santer, the European Union, the G7 countries, our fellow developing countries, the various international and regional organisations involved, and the exceptional inter-ministerial team that South Africa assembled to prepare for the hosting of this event, here we are, and I take great pleasure in opening this crucial Information and Development Conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the G7 Brussels Conference, many events have occurred on the international scene as well as in South Africa. We wish to mention some of them here because we believe that they are of relevance to this Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the international front, we witnessed the birth of a bold United Nations-World Bank Initiative for Africa. This multi-billion dollar Initiative places people and education at its centre and attempts to refocus international aid away from traditional assistance patterns and towards more sustainable and interactive development models.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last September, the ITU held its Telecom '95 Conference in Geneva during which President Mandela, addressing the Conference, insisted on the value of information, on the necessity of linking technology to people, and on the priority of education and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telecom '95 presented the participants with ever advancing technologies and, at the same time, reminded us of the sad and ever widening gap between rich and poor, between literate and illiterate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The path towards the information Society is not free of delicate and complex problems. We have observed the intricate and challenging discussions in the context of the World Trade Organisation on the provision of basic services. We regret that those discussions did not reach a positive conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the issue of intellectual property rights continues to be a bone of contention among the nations and deserves, in our view, serious and fair consideration by the international community as a whole. Intellectual property, an important pillar in the building of Global Information Society, requires recognition, respect and protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the midst of these and other difficulties, the corporate world is engaged in major processes leading to new mergers. Global alliances, with attendant restructuring, are being forged in various combinations, among hardware and software entities, telecommunications carriers, cable operators, satellite companies, publishing empires, broadcasting and media groups, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All these reorganisations are justified by their authors as natural and logical. Whatever the nervousness this activity may generate, it certainly demonstrates confidence in the future of the information and communication sectors as growth areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like all of you here, we follow these developments and observe them carefully in the context of our own Reconstruction and Development Programme and our guiding principles in the information sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the national front, as you know, our new Constitution was adopted by an overwhelming majority of South Africa's freely elected representatives a few days ago, on the 8th of May 1996. This historic document is itself focused on the development of a people-centred society, for whose realisation information and communication are central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Incidentally, if you wish to consult our Constitution, you will find it at the following internet address: www.constitution.org.za.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the South African government, we have issued two White Papers, one on broadcasting and the other on telecommunications. Both papers are now being circulated for comments. Several national fora on a variety of information and communication related topics have been established. They are essential participants in our policy making efforts, including the definition of our regulatory framework, which the White Paper seek to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against all these activities the challenge of building the basic information and communication infrastructure, both in South Africa and in most developing countries, remains colossal and perhaps not even properly understood. For this reason the so called 'Media Revolution' seems to be substantially ignoring the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We need to ensure that the path to the Information Society does not widen the gap between rich and poor, developed and developing countries. The tragic irony we might confront, is that this technology which has enormous potential to benefit all humanity could serve to entrench and widen this gap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without seeking in any way to evolve an apocalyptic vision, we must contend with the nightmare that could derive from the consequent rebellion of the poor against the rich on a global scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fundamental reason for this conference is to enable all of us as representatives drawn from both worlds, to grapple with these issues and not to allow the future of human society to fall victim to human ingenuity itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, we are conscious that infrastructure will not be built overnight and that the access of the masses to information and communication tools will not become reality in a short time period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the time has come for all of us to act swiftly by focusing on the problems and to built common strategies on how to seize the technological opportunities presented to us today for the benefit of all nations, developed and developing alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hence the timeliness of this Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Conference is unusual in many respects. Unlike most international conferences, specific in nature, drawing interest from particular industry or government sections, and often assembling participants from one economic origin, (either developing or developed), this gathering is global and multi-disciplinary, as clearly reflected in the list of our honoured guests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another feature of this conference is that the topics to be addressed, while all coming together from information and communication perspectives, run across a series of traditionally separate compartments (education, health, trade and industry, management, telecommunications, broadcasting, culture, science and technologies, finance, etc.).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This diversity leads, we believe, to yet another interesting feature.  Although equipped with our respective guiding principles and values, we all come to this Conference open-minded, ready to learn and to interact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be folly if one attempted to participate in this event on the basis of pre-conceived ideas and ready made solutions. We wonder if that could even be possible given the ever changing nature of the scene, the complexity of the debate, and the novelty of the propositions at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In exploring the structure and content of the Conference programme for both the Ministerial meetings and the Fora sessions, we find that it reflects the overwhelming richness of the Information Society and Development theme itself, and holds for us the perspective of an exciting and instructive outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind the seemingly endless and diverse list of inter-related or totally desperate discussion items, there appear to be three distinct pillars around which this Development Conference is conceived: infrastructure, content and finance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the first one, as mentioned earlier, there would be no Information Society without proper infrastructure and delivery mechanisms adapted to the global development needs of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are not talking only of the rich neighbourhoods in major cities, but also of the small villages and townships, rural and remote areas; not only of residential, industrial and downtown business districts, but also schools, hospitals, colleges and universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Content in news, educational, cultural and entertainment programmes, songs, games, etc., plays a pivotal role in the building of the Information Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore the creation, production and formulation of content must be encouraged at all levels, not only at the national level of all developing countries but, within the same nation, at the local and community levels, to ensure that developing nations do not remain information consumers of a content conceived by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Infrastructure allows for the transformation of people inspiration, creativity and artistic, literary and scientific skills into the production of education and entertainment works shared by all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third pillar of this construction is finance. I hope that the participants will find time to concentrate on this important question and engage in exchanges, irrespective of their national or social affiliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would also be useful that, beyond the official government exchanges, the industry itself, as well as the banking and finance sectors, participate in this interaction among these three pillars, leads us to discuss the indispensable co-operation among the three players, government, business and communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been demonstrated that government plays a pivotal role in the building of the Information Society. If this vision is not shared within and outside government, then the road ahead becomes more difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ample examples exist from developed countries themselves where, in spite of the predominant doctrine for minimal intervention, government acts as a catalyst for the establishment and consolidation of the Information Society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Often, and in co-operation with international and regional organisations, government contributes to the Information Society through tax and other incentives, using existing parastatal companies, regulatory agencies, educational institutions, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is, however, a crucial public policy dimension which rests on the shoulders of the government and on the people's elected representatives - ensuring that this Information Society supports and enhances the objectives of development, empowerment, economic development and preserves the constitutional values on which the whole national edifice is built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the concerns we expressed in Brussels pertains to the lack of an adequate regulatory framework to deal with the overall flows of information and cultural products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The realities of imbalance and domination between North and South must be dealt with more by empowering the South through co-operation and openness and mutually beneficial contributions rather than censorship and control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This concern is still with us. Permit me, Ladies and Gentlemen, to raise it again in the hope that renewed attention be devoted to it in this Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But government is not the only player. The private sector is entitled and indeed encouraged to play its role. Beyond the status of an information technology user, industry and trade must encourage training, foster internal communication by using modern technologies, invest in long term initiatives, and assist schools and hospitals with communication and information equipment and systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In turn, these actions benefit the people and the business community alike, making the people better and more educated workers, more powerful consumers, significant investors, better doctors, nurses, entrepreneurs and teachers, and increasing their numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To government and business, one must add communities and organisations of civil society. From trade unions to churches and charitable organisations, to municipalities and civic groups, all these art part of this endeavour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their role is essential because they convey the untouched, unprocessed sentiments of parents, family, youth and women, and therefore instruct us on the reality, nature and magnitude of their true needs, aspirations and potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We, in South Africa, strive to nurture and consolidate the tenets of a people-centred-society, creating, while using the means of information and communication a Learning Nation where innovation and knowledge are promoted, protected and rewarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We wish success to all the participants in this Conference which we consider as a milestone on the road to better international co-operation. We trust that your conclusions, distinguished delegates, will be followed by concrete initiatives and renewed interaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in spite of your heavy schedule, I urge you to find the time to enjoy our beautiful country. This is your home!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you very much.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference held yesterday at ECA, Mr. C.C Edordu indicated that the satisfactory economic progress of Africa has created a favourable condition for the operation of the bank which he said was established with a view to bringing about, among others, the stimulation and elargement of Intra-African trade as well as Africa's share in global trade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since its commencement of operation in 1994, the bank approved a 141 million dollars loan grossing an income of 12 million U.S. dollars in its first year of operation and netting a profit of 6 million, Mr. Edordu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank has also the aim of diversifying African export goods and facilitating financial services and loans in a bid to make African trade competent in the global trading activities, the director noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He listed the low involvement of Africa in the global trade, the less diversified export goods and the few trade partners as deterrent factors in the bank's activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank, whose headquarters is in Cairo, has over a hundred shareholders from among African governments, African and non African financial institutions, and private investors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - The sixth witness of the prosecutor against senior Derg officials said he had seen when the 59 officials of Emperor Haile Selassie were buried en masse in late 1975 here at the Addis Ababa prison house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The witness, a former prison inmate, gave a brief account of how he took part in the digging of a huge mass grave and helped to bury the 59 high ranking officials in broad day light on November 1975.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The witness told the court that in the wee hours of the night he and scores of other prisoners collected the bodies of the executed officials and taken to the huge grave where the ill-fated burial ceremony was conducted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - Liberian opinion leaders are strongly suggesting that the United Nations should take over the country as a trust territory, James Jonah, Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Liberia, said at a Headquarters press briefing this morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to questions on his visit to the region, he said leaders of Liberian civil society groups he met in Sierra Leone, in Ghana and even in camps in Liberia were of the view that &quot;there's no way out at the present time in Liberia, either for the Abuja Accords or any other peace plan&quot;. He did not know whether the proposal would be appealing to Member States because of the costs involved, &quot;but this a proposal of a significant number of Liberians in and outside of Liberia&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked for his personal view of the proposal, he said he thought it was a good idea, but he was also fully aware from his own involvement with the United Nations and the Security Council that &quot;there's no taste for it&quot;. It could not be implemented if governments were not willing to assume the costs and the danger, as the warlords would try to make it as difficult as possible for the United Nations to operate a transitional system in Liberia. He had informed the Security Council of his personal reading of what he believed was the wrong lessons of the situation in Somalia which had put &quot;us in a very serious position in Africa -- the tendency of governments to say we're not going to get involved because of the costs in blood and resources&quot;. He said it was a very dangerous idea which had to be re-evaluated. Governments had seen the results of such attitudes already in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to further questions, he said the Liberian opinion leaders felt that United Nations trusteeship was the only way left. Everything had been tried, including what Mr. Jonah described as the &quot;big gun theory&quot; -- which was getting all the warlords together and letting them sort it out.  &quot;They have not sorted it out and what we have here is a tragic scene of refugees on the high seas and no place to land. That is really tragic.&quot; The Liberian situation was the tip of the iceberg of similar ones elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the use of &quot;crack&quot; by the armed elements in Liberia, Mr.  Jonah described it as &quot;a cancer in the body politic of Africa&quot;. He said young boys and girls were kidnapped by the armed factions from villages and then given drugs. &quot;That is the way they are kept in line&quot;, he said, adding that &quot;it reminded him of an old British policy of giving soldiers a pint of beer&quot;.  He said he had stated at a briefing of members of the Security Council that it was time &quot;the world focused on this very dangerous tendency among armed elements&quot;. He said the use of drugs was widespread and not limited only to Liberia and Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What was the implication of the failure of west African leaders to hold their summit on the situation in Liberia in Accra last week? Were they getting fed up with the situation in Liberia, as generally believed? a correspondent asked. It was true that some leaders felt that way, Mr. Jonah said, noting that the scheduled meeting was the fourteenth by Heads of State of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on Liberia alone.  He gathered it was not a failure as such, but some of the leaders had felt there was no point attending when the two principal warlords, Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, had indicated that they would not be present. The meeting had consequently been held at foreign ministers level with the summit rescheduled for early August to give the factions more time to &quot;shape up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told a questioner that reports of involvement of the Economic Community of West African States' Monitoring Observer Group (ECOMOG) troops in stealing in Liberia could be exaggerated. He did not detect any organized large-scale looting by them during his visit, but he did hear of individual ECOMOG soldiers being involved. There had also been similar cases of commerce by ECOMOG troops trading in arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Jonah said he had informed the Security Council about a case of a vessel landing in Guinea with a good quantity of looted materiel. He said a responsibility had to be established. Without justifying their actions, he said many of the soldiers had not been paid for months. It was important that ECOMOG be given support for its job in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would action be taken against those individual soldiers responsible for looting? a correspondent asked, to which Mr. Jonah replied that such action rested with governments of the troop-contributing countries. The situation in Liberia, he said, was one of complete chaos, with no government to speak of.  Under those conditions it would be very difficult to identify those responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether it was possible to organize elections in Liberia before the achievement of genuine peace, as was done in Sierra Leone, Mr. Jonah said there were many differences although he did not believe it could not be done.  There were too many armed factions in Liberia, while Sierra Leone had only two. &quot;We were lucky in Sierra Leone to have a vibrant civil society voice -- women's groups, the press and church leaders who were very vocal and could not be cowed by the government. In Liberia it's extremely difficult for any one to open his mouth. These civil society groups have all gone underground.&quot; He also said that the fighting in Sierra Leone was confined to a section of the country, mostly in the east and south and intermittently in the north, while in Liberia, it was a generalized situation. Drawing on the Namibia experience in which South African forces there were confined to specific areas and monitored, Mr. Jonah said it was possible to envisage a similar programme in Liberia, &quot;if there is no way out&quot; there. Armed elements could be confined and monitored but not fully disarmed. It was a possibility that should be explored, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why the warring factions could not live together, he said it was &quot;a very difficult issue for Africa&quot;. There was no incentive on the part of those armed elements to make peace, he said, adding that they were prosperous under the prevailing circumstances. They were engaged in commerce, whether in timber or diamond trade. &quot;It is very lucrative&quot;, Mr. Jonah said. It was a problem that had to be addressed. It was not a question of their inability to live together because of ethnic differences. The faction leaders were not enemies, but were schoolmates, even relatives. They could be seen together at conferences, but would resume fighting on their return to Liberia. What was happening in the country was, in a way, a commercial war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked whether the peace process in Liberia was on course or dead, he said that as far as he could judge, there were difficulties in implementing it. The West African Foreign Ministers had been able to propose what he termed &quot;sensible ideas&quot; to put the process back on track. The question was whether the faction leaders would accept them. He hoped the process would be back on track; otherwise some countries might pull out from the endeavor altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting Mr. Jonah's description of the Liberian situation as a commercial war, a correspondent commented that there had been a couple of situations where the United Nations had imposed sanctions on rebel groups such as UNITA in Angola and Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. Was there some kind of action that could be taken to stop their trading, weaken their position and force them to the peace table? the correspondent asked. Mr. Jonah said sanctions had been imposed on Liberia about three years ago, but what had to be done was more than that. Those who engaged in commerce with the warlords were often not Liberians, or Africans. In many cases, they were Europeans and their governments are aware of what was going on. The businessmen were &quot;covertly encouraging&quot; those trading in illicit diamond mining and timber in exchange for weapons. &quot;If there are no buyers they will not continue with the trade. I think one has to look deeply into that.&quot; The governments concerned should look into their laws to bar their nationals from engaging in trade with &quot;warlords who are only concerned with enriching themselves, and in the process impoverishing their country and bringing about the loss of innocent lives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Would he recommend some form of a transitional authority in Liberia or a &quot;United Nations presence across the board&quot;? Mr. Jonah noted that there was a transitional government in place in Liberia. He personally did not like such transitional bodies because of their tendency &quot;to continue forever&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the text of a statement released by the Office of the White House press secretary after a meeting May 17 between Vice President Al Gore and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vice President Gore today met with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Mrs. Sadako Ogata on the situation in Liberia and pledged an additional $1 million for UNHCR's regional program for the Liberian refugees in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States released immediately $25,000 in emergency funds from the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to assist the Government of Ghana in addressing the urgent needs of the Bulk Challenge refugees. The United States has provided $68.4 million so far this year for refugee assistance in Africa, including for Liberians. The UNHCR staff is working with the Government of Ghana, the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to provide food, shelter and emergency medical care to these refugees. Vice President Gore told High Commissioner Ogata, &quot;We stand ready to provide additional funding if UNHCR's emergency funds prove insufficient in the current crisis.'&quot; The United States welcomes the decision of the Government of Ghana to disembark Liberian refugees from the cargo freighter Bulk Challenge. This action by President Rawlings and his government to allow life-saving aid and refuge for these suffering people is not only consistent with its international responsibilities under the OAU and Geneva Conventions, but also a model for other nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States deplores the continued fighting in Liberia that is the cause of this new outflow of Liberian refugees. Responsibility for this humanitarian catastrophe rests squarely with the faction leaders. The United States strongly reiterates its call on the faction leaders to end the senseless fighting in Liberia, reestablish the cease-fire, restore Monrovia as a safehaven and recommit to the Abuja peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States will continue its diplomatic efforts, in concert with ECOWAS, the U.N. and the OAU, to encourage a negotiated settlement in Liberia, and is ready to support any Liberian government that comes to power peacefully.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 300 head of cattle have so far died from the epidemic that spread in Dolo Ado, Liben, Moyale and Arero woredas, the department head, Ato Usman Ali said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since when the inoculation began, the epidemic has shown a sign of abatement, he said and expressed fear that lack of adequate medicine might made full control of the disease impossible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Divisional police prosecutor, Teddy Nondo, was yesterday told Post editors will not accept a mock trial in their criminal libel cases with President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking to Nondo before resident magistrate Betty Musonko came into the court room to resume trial, Post editor-in-chief Fred M'membe claimed the story that appeared in yesterday's Times of Zambia alleging that he and the paper's special projects editor, Masautso Phiri, and their lawyers failed to show up at court for trial was part of the state's &quot;dirty tricks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M'membe and Phiri are in court for a story their paper published on June 13, 1995 alleging that President Chiluba's Zairean lover, with whom he has an eight year daughter, was detained by the state in connection with a Post article concerning the President's biological father Luka Chabala Kafupi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our records and those of our lawyers indicate that the case was supposed to come up on May 14 and 15,&quot; M'membe told Nondo, asking: &quot; Where did the prosecution get May 13?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two editors warned that they will not accept anything short of a fair trial and the political or social status of President Chiluba will not be accepted as a basis for denying them justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It doesn't matter whether it is god Chiluba who is the complainant or any other such emperor, we have to get a fair trial,&quot; M'membe said. &quot;Short of this there will be no trial. We will stop coming to court and you can send us back to Chimbokaila.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The duo warned that this time, unlike the first time the matter was brought before the court, they will take no mistreatment from anyone - be it President Chiluba, the chief justice, the magistrate or the President's prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know the Chief Justice ruled that President Chiluba is above the law and not equal before the law with us, but we once brought to court, expect fairness,&quot; M'membe carped. &quot; Otherwise just convict us without a hearing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phiri accused the state of trying to round up all the defence's witnesses so that it becomes difficult for them to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You must have had a field day yesterday,&quot; Phiri remarked in reference to Monday when Nondo and President Chiluba's aide, deputy minister Eric Silwamba, who is the main prosecutor in the case, paraded the state witnesses in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But prosecutor Nondo took the charges calmly and simply strolled out of court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nondo denied that there were any &quot;dirty tricks&quot; in the mix-up of dates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And soon after the defence and the prosecution were seen joking and laughing with each other in a rather more friendly atmosphere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When queried about his apparent patching up with deputy minister Silwamba, M'membe said: &quot;Eric has been a friend of mine for many years, he is still my friend and he will continue to be my friend. This case and this government will one day come to pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence lawyer Sakwiba Sikota, who had held up the start of the trial because of commitments in the Supreme Court, said when the case resumed that as far as he knew, the trial was supposed to resume yesterday and continue today and not Monday. He apologised for the mix-up and proposed that the trial resume today and continue tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Silwamba raised no objections to the adjournment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Englishman is in Zambia on an assignment with Lonrho and extended his business trip to refereeing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also held a meeting with RAZ chief Kabungo Katongo and Confederation of African Football CAF instructor Chileshe Mukuka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referees Association of Zambia general secretary Lawrence Siloya announced in Luanshya that Eagle would handle the match with Gibson Lukoshi and Steven Lungu as his linesmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eagle who has been in Zambia for two weeks, is a senior referee in Solihull and watched the clash between Rumlex and City last weekend and was impressed by the performance of the two teams and refereeing standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eagle is expected to leave for England next Tuesday after showing Zambian soccer fans how the game of football can be handled 'the English way.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile the first of the six foreign internationals on the Zambia national team arrived home on Tuesday saying he was in tip-top condition for next month's World Cup game against Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''I'll need a few days' rest and time to see my family in Mufulira before I can be ready to join camp, but I am looking forward to it,'' he said at Lusaka International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongo said his central defence partners for Zambia, Elijah Litana, who also plays in the Saudi league would be home next week as the season in the oil-rich gulf kingdon had closed for a break.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Parliament today wound-up debate on the 1996 Constitution Amendment Bill and the Constitution of Zambia Bill paving way for amendments to be passed in the committee stage tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To enter the committee stage the Bill mustered 121 votes against the two cast against it by Mongu Central MP, Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika and her sister, Dr Inonge (Senanga), both of whom are on the opposition National Party ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two bills, however, passed without the contributions of UNIP members of parliament as well as Sikongo MP, Simon Zukas (MMD), Lusaka Central MP, Dipak Patel (MMD) and Solwezi central MP, Humphrey Mulemba (NP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier Speaker of the National Assembly, Robinson Nabulyato, had curtailed debate on the Bill after 37 members debated it for two consecutive days in addition to the two days of the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Speaker said further debate will only create repetition which would be at the expense of other parliamentary work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winding up debate leader of the House and State Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda assured that there was nothing racist or hostile about the Bill.  Brigadier-General Miyanda (retired) urged opposition MP's to reconsider their opposing stand and contribute to the amendments in the 1996 draft constitution at committee stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Constitution of Zambia Bill, which in essence gives legality to the Amendment Bill also went through to committee stage where all the amendments including submissions made to the Mwanakatwe Constitution Review Commission will be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill also provides for the legal printing and publication of the amended constitution, saving and transitional provisions of existing offices, institutions and law and the succession of property, assets, rights, liabilities, obligations and legal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other bills presented today were the Zambia Institute of Mass Communication (ZAMCOM) repeal bill to repeal the Mass Communication Bill of 1991 and the Ministerial and Parliamentary offices Emoluments Amendment Bill to amend the 1992 act. They will come-up for debate tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OPPOSITION United National Independence Party (UNIP) members ended their parliamentary boycott this afternoon after the conclusion of the contentious Constitutional (Amendment) Bill debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group of UNIP parliamentarians walked in when the House was considering the Land (Amendment) Bill which passed through second reading with no debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thereafter, Environment and Natural Resources Minister, William Harrington presented the Action for Smoke Damage (prohibition) (repeal) Bill for second reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moving the motion, Mr Harrington said the Act which was enacted in colonial time had to be repealed because it had become old fashioned, oppressive and repulsive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that an investigation taken in 1988 revealed that there was an increase in the number of people reporting to clinics complaining of sneezing in the wind ward direction of Mufulira and Luanshya mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister further told the House that about 'millions' of tonnes of caborn dioxide were polluting the air annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that about one million people in the country were exposed to dangerous sulpher dioxide, carbon monoxide and other air impurities arising from smoke from mines and industries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The woman, who said she was a businesswoman, gave her name as Mununga Muzyinga Clementina and told Lusaka Magistrate Mrs Betty Musonko that she has never met President Chiluba in her life and that it was not true she had a daughter with him although she was unmarried with three children from three different men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mununga Muzyinga of House number 26, Bulanda Street, Maikulile in Chingola was testifying in a case of defamation of President Chiluba by Post newspaper Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief, Fred M'membe and special projects editor, Matsauso Phiri emanating from a June 13 Post pulication in which it was alleged that the President's Zairean lover Clementine Mutshinga Kabondo, in apparent reference to Ms Mununga, was detained and interrogated in connection with the Kafupi story and her photograph appeared in the edition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms Mununga both denied that her name was Kabondo and that she ever knew the alleged President Chiluba's alleged 'father' Kafupi Chabala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She also denied that she gave the Post the photograph saying the picture could have been acquired from her friend Marianne who was the custodian at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by Divisional Prosecutions Officer, Teddy Nondo, names of the fathers of her children, the woman who said she was a Luvale from Zambezi district said her eldest daughter born in 1981 was Kailu Kainga whose father she remembers him as Mateyo. The second, a son, was Sydney Malama whose father was Sai Malama and the last one Bridget Lumba whose father was Lumba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The woman told the court that the Post story was a mere fabrication which made her unhappy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, the court dismissed two defence applications which had been put forward to stop proceeding with the trial until State House deputy minister, Eric Silwamba testified and that two other cases of defamation involving the same accused persons be joined together on one charge sheet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mrs Musonko adjourned the case to June 19 and 20 for cross examination and continued trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a press conference to launch the 1996 UNIP manifesto at Pamodzi Hotel, president Kaunda complained about the rapid deterioration in the quality of life of Zambians since the MMD came to power in November 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In 1994 the decline was 7 per cent and in 1995 it was 4 per cent while the population continues to grow at 3.4 per cent,&quot; Kaunda said. &quot;The economy has been grossly mismanaged and abused as evidenced by an unstable macro-economic environment as indicated by high inflation, high unemployment and unstable exchange rates.&quot; President Kaunda, who partially conceded that the economy had started to decline under his government, blamed the deterioration on the liberation struggle in the Southern African region and the &quot;the energy crisis which tripled the cost of oil in 1973, inducing a worldwide recession&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; The need to sustain development against the background of these overwhelming factors forced the government to start borrowing from the international money markets,&quot; president Kaunda explained. &quot; Our consultations with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund then affirmed the need to sustain development.&quot; The UNIP president also reiterated his earlier claims that the privatisation programme was his government's 'baby'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is ample evidence that the MMD is doing what we left. If you check the 1989 budget speech of my former finance minister late Gibson Chigaga, you will find everything that MMD are doing,&quot; president Kaunda said, asking: &quot;Who copied from who?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Kaunda also complained about the level of political maturity.  &quot;Thirty two years after attaining nationhood we are trivialising important national issues and developing personal constitutions,&quot; Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And president Kaunda vowed to defy the law if the Constitution bill is passed to bar him from contesting for presidency. &quot;To bar me from standing one has to go and dig out my umutoto( umbilical cord), dig all the bones of old man David Kaunda and Hellen Kaunda from Lubwe Mission in Chinsali,&quot; Kaunda challenged. &quot;Without that there is no hope at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Finance Minister Ronald Penza said Kaunda should go ahead and exhume his mother if that pleases him but Zambia would not again allow him to rule.  Kaunda re-affirmed his support for the UNIP walk-out from Parliament saying &quot; UNIP did not want to legitimise criminal acts&quot;. &quot;We fully support our colleagues for what they have done as almost all political leaders and other interested parties, including the Mwanakatwe Commission, recommended consensus as the approach to the adoption of the constitution.&quot; President Kaunda also charged that MMD chairman Sikota Wina's last week's accusations of interference in Zambia's internal affairs by Botswana president and chairman of the Frontline heads of state, Quett Masire, for suggesting that a meeting be convened to address &quot;the crisis in Zambia&quot; showed the extent to which the MMD was detached from &quot;reality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's surprising that they are saying there is no crisis,&quot; president Kaunda said. &quot;This is not reading the situation correctly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Two local companies have been appointed joint distributors of South Africa's Justine range of skin care products in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The companies, Douceur Beauty Cosmetics and Bellwood Investments Corporation, won distributorship of the leading South African cosmetic products range, Justin and Avon, which is one of the world's largest seller of skin care products.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an interview at the inauguration of the beauty products on Monday, the two companies' spokesperson Margaret Nkula disclosed that the two companies will hold a two day exhibition at Lusaka's Pamodzi Hotel to introduce the Zambian public to the skin care products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similar workshops, to be conducted by the group's international marketing manager Estelle Von Mollendorf, will be held in Ndola and Kitwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The workshop is targeted at professionals in business, women, diplomats, potential distributors, wholesale and retail assistants and also media personnel,&quot; Nkula said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And speaking in an interview last Wednesday London based professional beautician, Cynthia Lewis, disclosed that good cosmetic products were difficult to find in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The only problem we have in our industry is the acquisition of high quality beauty products,&quot; Lewis carped. &quot; This forces us to import whenever we need the products.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And with an annual turnover of R16 billion, the Justin and Avon group are one of the largest direct sellers of beauty skin care products which include fragrances, toiletries and cosmetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group has been the official sponsors of the Miss South Africa and Miss World contests during the last four years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Judo Association of Zambia (JAZ) has launched a scathing attack on the Zambia Olympics and Commonwealth Games Association (ZOCAGA) for dropping two judokas from the list of Zambian sportsmen and women going for the &quot;Atlanta 96&quot; games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judo chief, Mohammed Bachher, in a recent interview in Lusaka expressed surprise at the decision by ZOCAGA to drop the only judokas, Moola Lipile and Hilter Shakaungu, moaning that it was unfair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;None of the people from ZOCAGA has ever been to a Judo tournament to assess the strength of our judokas and suddenly they decide, without even informing us, that they are dropping judokas. This is unfair,&quot; moaned Machher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to ZOCAGA boss, Patrick Chamunda, the decision to drop the judokas was reached because of the poor training programmes they had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Judokas have not had very serious preparations, hence the decision to drop them. We are only carrying the six athletes and six boxers in whom we have confidence,&quot; said Chamunda in a press statement recently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Talks between the government and private investors on the Konkola Deep Mining Project have to be concluded soon to avert a possible copper 'drought' due to delays in implementation of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Konkola Division general manager, Ben Chileshe, the government has been working out the modalities of a joint private venture with a host of other investors led by Anglo American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consortium of investors, which includes mining giants such as Gencor and Western Mining of Australia, is contributing about $650 million in capital for the project though they are yet to agree with the government on the division of interests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZCCM hopes that the implementation of the Konkola Deep Project, which can only start producing revenue in eight years time if it were started in the next few months, will increase Zambia's copper production as well as make it more competitive on the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Upon completion, production at Konkola is expected to increase from the current two million tonnes of ore to six million tonnes, representing 50 per cent of Zambia's copper production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia is currently producing 300,000 tonnes of copper annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are also concerned that if we don't get the investment soon then the country might lose revenue as Nchanga Open Pit Mine, a major copper producer, is closing down,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chileshe disclosed that the current production cost of 68 cents per pound of Konkola copper was not favourable as it reduces the profit margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He revealed that when Konkola Deep is finished, it will be producing at a cost of 32 cents a pound, over half the former cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Chileshe said the Mufulira smelter is tied to the Konkola Deep Project as it has been identified as the refinery for Konkola ore because there is no smelter at Konkola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This means that in this first step towards the privatisation of the mines, both Konkola Deep and the Mufulira Smelter are being negotiated in a single package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The $650 million being contributed by the consortium is to be used over eight years in a programme which will see a new shaft system being installed and the re-training of staff, among other things, to raise mining standards to internationally competitive levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And of the 5000 workers employed by Konkola, 1,000 workers will have lost their jobs by the end of the privatisation process because the company is departing from labour intensive methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chileshe said the reduced work force will be able to produce more because about 250 machines will replace the use of underground labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said employment should not be of much concern because the privatisation of the mines would create diversification in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will need these new machines coming in to be maintained so other private satellite companies can be formed to service our organisation thus creating employment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - National Sports Council of Zambia (NSCZ) chairman, Patrick Chamunda, facing pressure over the appointment of a British volunteer as sports council acting general secretary, has defended the move as &quot;the best for the Council&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview recently when he announced the team for the Atlanta Olympics fund-raising committee, Chamunda said he saw nothing wrong in his appointment of Mary Nicholson as general secretary.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Why should people start questioning the appointment of Mary, personally I do not see any anything wrong in appointing her. The reasons why people could start asking why we appointed her could only be because she is from Britain and, not a Zambian, but she has proved she can help,&quot; said Chamunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a number of leading sports administrators have questioned the morality of the appointment, when qualified Zambians are around to take up the job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is an insult because in the first place, she is just a volunteer and as such must not be in a position like the one she now has. And secondly does her appointment mean that there are no Zambians who can do what she is doing?,&quot; wondered a sports administrator.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is the text of the prepared statement on Nigeria by Peter Tarnoff, under secretary of state for political affairs, for the Africa subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, May 15:<BR> Good afternoon. I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee to discuss our policy objectives toward Nigeria. It so happens that Nigeria was my first foreign service post and I have retained a strong interest in its development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We cannot ignore Nigeria's size, population and impact in Africa. It has considerable influence on the West Africa region for better or worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our principal interest remains to have a stable, democratic Nigeria with which the U.S. can pursue productive, cooperative relations. We do not wish to see Nigeria become a pariah state that might use its influence and resources recklessly and irresponsibly. We have a profound interest in restoring the rule of law in Nigeria, a nation where, as secretary Christopher has put it, &quot;disdain for law protects the drug trade even as it harms ordinary citizens.&quot; Separate and apart from our concerns on democratization and human rights, we note Nigeria is a major supplier of heroin to the United States. For the third year in a row, Nigeria was denied certification for not being cooperative in counternarcotics efforts or working on its own to meet the goals of the 1988 U.N. Convention on Counternarcotics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigeria situation, regarding the transition to civilian government and respect for human rights, is becoming increasingly more serious. We have been working diligently with the international community to develop approaches aimed at prompting the Nigerian leadership to re-think its current direction. We are continuing our consultations on new measures with the European Union (EU), the commonwealth and others. We believe that a broader consensus and a stronger message will ultimately result in more effective measures. Nothing is off the table, including the options contained in pending legislative proposals in both the Senate and House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me begin, however, with a review of the situation in Nigeria as it has developed since December, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.N. human rights fact-finding team, mandated by the U.N. General Assembly resolution passed last November, recently completed a two-week visit. Although the team's report has not yet been released, we understand that in a final press briefing, the team leader, Justice Amega of Togo, described the human rights situation in Nigeria as &quot;terrible&quot; and the political situation as &quot;terrifying.&quot; Additionally, on at least two occasions, security forces attempted to prevent the team from interviewing human rights activists. The team did, however, speak with Ogoni leaders, human rights activists, and with chief M.K.O. Abiola. While we welcome the regime's acceptance of this first independent fact-finding mission to look at Nigeria's human rights performance, we deplore the further deterioration of the human rights situation. For example:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (1) Mrs. Kudirat Abiola, wife of chief M.K.O. Abiola, who is still imprisoned pending completion of his trial on treason charges, and two others were arrested in Lagos May 7 and arraigned May 8 on charges of conspiracy and false publication. Three were released on bail on May 8 after entering not guilty pleas. A trial date was set for May 28. If convicted the three face prison sentences of up to seven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (2) Additionally, within the past months several prominent Nigerian activists have been arrested, including activist lawyer Gani Fawehinmi and journalist Nosa Igiebor. Offices of the Guardian newspaper were set on fire, thousands of copies of Igiebor's &quot;Tell&quot; newsmagazine were seized, and Nadeco's offices were raided. Nineteen Ogoni activists, held since May 1994, await trial by the same tribunal which condemned Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others to death last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (3) The government of Nigeria recently disrupted two conferences co-sponsored by the U.S. government. The first in Jos, on the &quot;dilemmas of democracy,&quot; organized by the African Center for Democratic Governance, was crudely disrupted by security forces on March 13. The second, the fifth annual meeting of the American Studies Association of Nigeria at Kaduna, was canceled by security forces on March 25 without explanation at the last minute. The meeting had attracted participants from many African countries and several Nigerian academic institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States is gravely concerned about these incidents and the arrests and continued detentions of persons expressing views contrary to those of the government. They raise serious doubts about the government of Nigeria's commitment to democratization and the stated goal of returning the government to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transition Program</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has completed the second quarter of its three-year transition program. Even judged by its own timetable and against its own criteria, the regime's record is not good. The draft constitution was not promulgated as called for by the original program; rather it was &quot;approved&quot; by the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) on the eve of general Abacha's October 1 speech. Although decree two ostensibly lifts restrictions on political activity, decree one created a new criminal offense for &quot;undermining&quot; the transition program, a crime punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime did establish an electoral commission, the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON), several transition committees and issued enabling decrees to give them a legal mandate. NECON, however, had problems organizing and managing the local government elections held in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-partisan local government elections using an open ballot system were held as scheduled on March 16. There were many reports of irregularities during and following the elections, including disqualification of candidates for &quot;security concerns&quot; even after they had been elected. Moreover, decree six, signed by Abacha before the elections, but released after they had been completed, permits the removal from office of any elected local government official at the option of the head of state, and in the case of chairmen, replacement by sole administrators. Decree six is totally inconsistent with democratic values and principles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. and International Action</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe it would be a grave mistake to conduct &quot;business as usual&quot; with Nigeria in the absence of significant progress towards a credible program for the return of civilian democratic rule and respect for human rights. Earlier this year, we began an intensive round of consultations with the international community on possible new strong collective measures aimed at persuading the government of Nigeria to speed its transition to democracy and respect the human rights of the Nigerian people. These consultations continue and we are pleased with the progress we have made thus far in encouraging like-minded states to bring pressure to bear on the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States co-sponsored successful resolutions in both the U.N.  General Assembly and the U.N. Human Rights Commission that expressed concern over human rights abuses and called for restoration of civilian, democratic government. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) met in London on April 23 to review the situation in Nigeria following Nigeria's refusal to accept a commonwealth visit. The meeting recommended that commonwealth member states implement new measures to register their continuing disapproval of developments in Nigeria. Among the recommended measures, which are similar to those the U.S. and European Union already have in place, are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian regime and their families;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- withdrawal of military attaches, termination of military training, and an embargo on arms exports;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- downgrading of cultural and educational links;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- downgrading diplomatic missions; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- banning sporting contacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We intend to raise the issue of Nigeria at the summit meeting of the eight in Lyon, France, late next month in the hope that the heads of state will condemn Nigerian actions. We welcome the decision by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group and we would hope that all commonwealth member states would adopt these measures. We are especially encouraged by their willingness to consider additional measures in consultation with the U.S. and the EU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Commission has undertaken a study of possible new measures.  The EU study, due to be completed in late May for an early June meeting of European foreign ministers, will review a broad range of possible measures to encourage transition to a democratic and stable Nigeria. We are pressing the EU and commonwealth countries to take further action, and while we prefer collective measures, we have not ruled out further unilateral actions by the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, it is important to remember the humanitarian tragedy unleashed in Liberia. Nigeria has been an important player in past attempts to bring peace to Liberia, and we have every reason to believe that it will continue to play a significant role in resolving the present crisis in Liberia. Nigeria contributes approximately 80 percent of the troops to the largely self-supporting West African peacekeeping force, ECOMOG. In addition, Nigeria was instrumental in brokering the Abuja Peace Accord in August 1995.  Although the Abuja peace process has been sorely tested by over a month of death and destruction perpetrated by factional fighting, we maintain that the Abuja framework represents Liberia's best hope for a lasting peace. We will continue to work in partnership with Liberia's neighboring countries -- including Nigeria -- and others in the international community to restore peace in Liberia. This will not deter us, however, from continuing to press the Abacha government to improve the human rights situation in Nigeria and speed its transition to civilian democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conclusion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. resolutions and commonwealth recommendations, along with the measures the European Union and the United States already have in place, demonstrate that the international community will not permit the GON (Government of Nigeria) to impede democratic progress or disregard human rights with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Assistant Secretary George Moose said in December, we once again call on the government of Nigeria to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- accelerate the transition process with steps that are politically meaningful;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- release all political prisoners now;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- restore habeas corpus and an independent judicial process which does not rely on special tribunals now;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- legalize political parties now;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- and restore the independence of labor unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last November, immediately after the hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni, the president announced new measures against Nigeria including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- the recall of Ambassador Carrington for consultations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- a ban on the sale and repair of military goods and services to Nigeria;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- an extension of the ban on visas to include all military officers and civilians who actively formulate, implement, or benefit from the policies that impede Nigeria's transition to democracy;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- a requirement that Nigerian government officials visiting the United Nations or the international financial institutions to remain within 25 miles of those organizations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- that we begin immediate consultations on appropriate U.N. measures to condemn the executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In closing, let me say that we will continue to stress the overriding importance of respect for human rights in our bilateral relations with Nigeria. We will continue to press for a credible transition process built on the active and inclusive participation of the Nigerian people. We will press for a genuine dialogue with the government of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we continue to consult with the international community on new collective measures, we are encouraged by the positive movement thus far by international groups. We are mindful that any new action will be much more meaningful once a consensus is developed. All options, including those contained in pending legislative proposals in your bill and in Congressman Payne's, remain on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you once again for this opportunity to come before your committee and discuss Nigeria. I appreciate your interest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - On Thursday the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) announced five new additions to the Olympic team For the Centennial Olympic Games which take place in Atlanta in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Canoeist Ruth Nortje was the only one of the five new members who seemed to be a certainty for Atlanta after her stunning performance at the sprint canoe Olympic qualification regatta in Seville last weekend. Nortje became the first local canoeist ever to mount the medal podium when she won the final of the individual 500m kayak (K1-SOOm) in a new South African best time of 1:52.18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At last year's world championships in Duisburg the top eight boats qualified automatically for Atlanta. In Seville the top four boats earned Olympic places and after winning her semi-final on Sunday morning she made sure of her place on the Olympic team by putting in a tremendous finishing burst in the final that afternoon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nortje (27) went to live in America in November 1994 but she found it very tough training in the cold American winter last year and did not fare well at the world championships where she failed to reach the semi-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This February she went to Florida to escape the icy grip of winter and trained with the American and Canadian squads. That stint did wonders for her form and confidence and at the South African sprint trials in April she set a personal best of 1:56.00. But even that didn't prepare anybody for her world class time in Seville.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there are no official world records for canoeing because of the large variance in wind and water conditions, her time, which was recorded in calm conditions in contrast to the strong cross winds earlier in the week, is just over two seconds outside the fastest time ever recorded. In Barcelona such a time would have earned her the bronze medal, and although it is premature to say she is a medal prospect in Atlanta, she is expected to reach the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Last year I really struggled in America and I'm just very relieved that things have finally come right for me,&quot; said Nortje. She is competing in a regatta in Milan this weekend and will probably stay on in Europe for another regatta in Budapest in two weeks' time. She will then return to South Africa to train under the national team's Hungarian coach, Nandor Almasi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In shooting, South Africa had to qualify for Atlanta through the African championships in Cairo last year and six local shottists earned places. But in line with Nocsa's policy of only sending top class competitors who can reach the semi-finals or the top 16 of their events, these shottists were required to prove themselves in international competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the world cup event in Atlanta three weeks ago most of the world's top marksmen took part to get a feel of the Wolf Creek Shooting Complex which will stage the Olympic shooting competitions. Jaco Henn in the free rifle 60 shots prone and Melville Hains in the skeet 125 shots did the best out of the South Africans and they have been selected for the Olympic team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Henn (21) is extremely young for an international shottist and he came 12th from a field of 110 in his best discipline which uses a .22 calibre rifle. With a maximum score of 10 per shot Henn scored 593 in his elimination round out of a possible score of 600. In the qualifying round for the eight-man final he shot a score of 594. The highest scores of the day were two rounds of 597. &quot;The elimination round was quite tricky because it was windy and it kept blowing from different directions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was very happy with my performance overall and it was good experience for the Olympics. Its really great to know that I'm finally going to the Games,&quot; said Henn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hains (35) came 15th out of 130 competitors in the skeet competition which consists of five rounds of 25 shots with a shotgun at clay pigeon targets from eight different positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seven South African wrestlers qualified for Atlanta at the All Africa Games but because they didn't compete at last year's world championships they were sent to a top tournament in Greece at the end of February to see how they would perform in the international arena. Andrew Davidson in the 100kg freestyle and Tjaart du Plessis in the 62kg freestyle both finished fifth at the tournament which earned their tickets to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 16-member Olympic hockey squad of Brian Myburgh, Brad Milne, Shaun Cooke, Craig Jackson, Craig Fulton, Bradley Michalaro, Gregg Clarke, Gary Boddington, Alistar Fredericks, Wayne Graham (captain), Kevin Chree, Charles Teversham, Greg Nicol, Mathew Hallowes, Grant Fulton and Murray Anderson are all included in the 20-man squad that will compete in a four nation tournament in Australia at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will be hoping to come through unscathed from this tour and the three-test home series against Spain in June, for injury at this late stage would be a cruel blow indeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the Olympic team now standing at 72 there are just a few places to be filled before the final line up for Atlanta is known. Tennis should name its team in the next week while rowing must nominate the people who will crew the men's lightweight coxless fours boat and the women's coxless pairs boat which have already been selected. There is hope of another boat also qualifying at a regatta in Switzerland early in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa is hoping Claude Cloete will make it through the final modern pentathlon qualifying competition in Rome next week, but Nocsa president Sam Ramsamy has said it will consider applying for a wild card if he doesn't qualify. A wild card enables athletes from developing countries to compete at the Olympics without qualifying, thus ensuring universality at the Games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - It's tempting to think of Washington, DC, in terms of Johannesburg, two black cities where the whites have most of the money. In fact, the two cities have a lot in common, which anyone who's spent time in both places would be reminded of after seeing Ntosake Shange's &quot;Nomathemba,&quot; vibrantly staged and enthusiastically received at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts over the past month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's a long way of getting around to saying that this musical love story, performed by a cast of 23 and featuring the legendary Ladysmith Black Mambazo (whom even American teenagers know about here thanks to their parents' Paul Simon records), is so generic in its plot and characters, that it could be adapted and reset just about anywhere in the world. Forget apartheid, in other words. This is a post-apartheid soap opera, set to music.  And a very good one.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which doesn't, one suspects, especially trouble Shange or Ricardo Khan, who developed Nomathemba at New Jersey's African-American Crossroads Theater and made a deal with the Kennedy Center to bring it to the premier showcase in America's capital. It's had a spectacular month-long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am interested in the very specific dream of African America ideas,&quot; Khan told The Washington Post, &quot;but I am also interested in what happens when you connect those specific dreams to artists from other countries. There is ... electricity out there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plenty of the voltage was supplied by the beautiful, sinuous, Cee Cee Harshaw, who plays Nomathemba, a &quot;modern&quot; Kwazulu village girl who tires of her dithering, boastful boyfriend and flees to Johannesburg to put a little sizzle into her life. Of course, the big city hands her more than she bargained. Meanwhile her boyfriend Bongani, engagingly played by Ntare Mwine, eventually realizes what he's lost and goes off to find her, along the way hilariously falling into the hands of a con man (Leelai Demoz) in a dreary workers hostel. Guess what, though? Boy gets girl. Nomathemba and Bongani find each other and return home and live happily ever after (we hope).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hope, of course, is what this touchingly naive but invigorating musical is all about -- hope in the face of loss and suffering, and thus a metaphor for the apartheid years if one wishes to read it that way. From where I sat, though, Nomathemba was a universal love story for the chaotic, violent, or merely alienating transnational age we live in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week Kwazulu, next week Liberia. Or the Anacostia section of Washington, DC, where the descendants of North Carolina slaves still live in depressing, if often, noble, squalor. That Nomathemba is a distinctly South African drama, buoyed throughout by Joseph Shabalala's joyful rhythms and hymns, takes nothing from it, of course. When the audience rose in three standing ovations at the end, we were applauding as much for the thing as the play.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - There are moments in history which stand out like candles in a darkened room, illuminating the horrors of the past while also casting light on the promise of redemption and healing. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission finds itself at such a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And whether it emerges as a beacon of hope or as a surface salve for incurable wounds forms the basis of If Truth Be Told, a three-part documentary produced by Steven Markovitz and directed by Mark Kaplan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Call it what you will: spectacle, theatre, group therapy, exorcism or catharsis. From the most cynical perspective, the truth commission is riveting television viewing. It has all the components of a bestseller: intrigue, tragedy, bizarre plot twists and even some light relief, within the context of an otherwise harrowing epic. Most importantly, it does not have to be hauled from the mausoleums of distant history; it is living, breathing testimony to a country that still has heroes and to people struggling to come to terms with the brutal past.So it comes as a disappointment that the series, though moving and timeous, doesn't really live up to its mission statement -- &quot;to explore issues facing the truth commission&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part one focuses on Siphiwo Mtimkulu, an Eastern Cape student leader who was detained and tortured before disappearing in 1982. The film attempts to reconstruct the weeks before his disappearance, as well as his period in detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while the story is poignant and significant, both as a personal tragedy and as a example of the fate met by some of South Africa's brightest political stars, once its emotive appeal has begun to wear thin, the film becomes a series of talking heads, interspersed with crudely enacted inserts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out in the Open, the second episode, deals with a different set of problems -- condensing a seminal but complex phase of apartheid history (the 1980s) into a coherent narrative, without becoming a confession-session for the perpetrators of human-rights abuses, or a promotional video for the truth commission itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It meets the first two challenges, although there appears to be some embarrassing confusion as a photograph of Matthew Goniwe is identified as Fort Calata. But despite its attempts at maintaining a sober, critical perspective on the issue of the truth commission, it doesn't manage to transcend its in-house approach to the subject.Happily, the ambit of the third part -- The Rights of the Wronged -- is broadened to include debates on the viability of the commission, with reference to similar models in Chile, Argentina, Rwanda and former Yugoslavia. But again laudable intentions get trapped within the talking-heads syndrome, at the expense of dramatic footage of witnesses giving evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, it allows the family members of murdered activists to express their pain, their desire for justice and their misgivings about the effectiveness of the truth commission as a catalyst for healing and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The fallout of the rand since mid-February has contributed to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's All-Gold index (ALGI) rising to levels last seen at the end of 1994 and the Industrial index (ALII) falling to wipe out this year's gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A declining rand has boosted prospects for South Africa's troubled gold producers which export their output. The ALGI surpassed the 2 000 level last week for the first time since December 1994. By May last year the index was below 1 400 and 1 300 by October. It has been rising ever since to reach 2 000 last week, still below its highs of near 2 500 in September 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poor performance of South Africa's gold mining sector is reflected in the ALGI's performance, which was at the same 2 000 level at the beginning of 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sharp contrast is the performance of industrial firms. In January 1987, the ALII was around 1 500. This week it is just under 8 000 and was near 8 600 at the beginning of the year before the rand crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JSE's Overall Index has dropped from just under 7 000 in April to 6 745 last week before recovering to 6 845 this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The indices were adjusted in March to include all firms except pyramid companies. Previously, firms accounting for 80% of market capitalisation were included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In dollar terms, the JSE has appreciated far more. Foreign investors have not deserted the exchange and thus, as a group, have not contributed significantly to the rand's decline. So far foreigners have bought a net</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> R3,1-billion in equities this year, peaking at R1-billion in February before falling to R478- million in March, R319-million in April and R224-million in the first two weeks of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1995, net foreign purchases on the JSE were R4,8-billion. In that year, share trade on emerging markets accounted for 9% of the total value of world share trade or some $108- billion out of nearly $12-trillion traded.  The JSE thus attracts less than 1% of foreign investment in emerging equity markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JSE might be the 12th largest exchange in the world but its main problem is liquidity. As a portion of total market capitalisation the JSE's turnover is only 6%. In 1995, Turkey saw the heaviest turnover (247%), meaning that the average share changed hands more than twice. The turnover ratio in the United States and Japan was 75% and 34% respectively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Despite Telkom's claims that it is unable to finance a universal service without a strategic equity partner, it has invested $20- million in a multinational satellite company, ICO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As one of 47 telecommunications companies to invest in an operation with an equity of $3,5- billion, ICO intends to invest a sixth of that in Africa.  ICO vice-president Pat McDougal sees the investment as directly in the spirit of the Information Society and Development Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The conference is trying to extend some of the fruits of the global information society to the less developed areas of the world, in South Africa's case to the less developed areas in the overall economy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The idea is that the satellite constellation will allow people to make calls and connect anywhere in the world, cutting through the problems of different cellular networks and areas that are too remote and too expensive to be covered. &quot;In the African infrastructure it is a good way to leapfrog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While from the end-user's perspective by 2000, the potential for coverage all over the world, using the satellite's roaming mode, is encouraging, the fact is that the average rural dweller will still find the cost exorbitant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McDougal says &quot;The average cost of a call will still be about $1. It will never come down to 5c, which would make it a truly universal service, but it is the next step down in terms of universality.&quot; The only possible cheap access will be through the wireless call box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Telkom, the reason to invest is clear: from the financial aspect the company will benefit, and it complements its general plans to roll out a universal service. From an ISAD perspective the investment is positive in that it shows the potential of developing countries to leverage international projects for both economic and developmental purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> @ Manuel -- end to rand-slide in sight</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Depreciation of the rand offers 'a window of opportunity for exports', said the finance minister in defence of the rand crisis. Lynda Loxton reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Minister Trevor Manuel this week strongly defended government's handling of the rand crisis and predicted that the rand's dramatic slide against the dollar would soon be over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But opposition parties took advantage of a snap debate in parliament to blame the rand's slide on everything from government's support for Cosatu in the lock-out wrangle to its friendship with Cuba and Libya, perceived antipathy to the market and the delay of the KwaZulu-Natal local elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manual shrugged off these barbs and said: &quot;Let us not be taken in by the shorter fluctuations ... Let's retain our focus on the long term. This deemed crisis, I assure you, will soon pass.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate, relatively muted and sparsely attended, despite recent panic in the media about the state of the rand, had been called by the Democratic Party. DP finance representative Ken Andrew said that &quot;the prevalence of cynicism and even hostility towards markets&quot; on the part of the government needed &quot;urgent attention&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel said it was important to &quot;recognise market imperfections. The market certainly is not perfect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The question is whether this depreciation is all detrimental to the economy and whether there is a need for all doom and gloom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the rand crisis, business leaders had argued that the rand was overvalued and &quot;industrialists complained that they were being squeezed out in the export side,&quot; Manuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite this, the depreciation of the rand had not been met with relief &quot;and we have to ask our exporters to take a second look at the situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be best if they took account of the depreciation and did not &quot;bang on the door of my colleague (Trade and Industry Minister) Alec Erwin and appeal for the reinstatement&quot; of export incentives now being phased out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Depreciation, I am saying, offers a window of opportunity for exports.  The concern at the moment is about volatility and where it will settle,&quot; Manuel said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He and several African National Congress parliamentarians said that the fall in the rand had been underpinned by the fact that growth had been stunted by the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Isolation had forced it to run current account surpluses to offset capital account deficits. After the 1994 elections, the new government was able to run current account deficits and import foreign capital to help boost growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However, much of it was short-term and susceptible to sudden changes in sentiment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That change in sentiment had been owing to higher bond rates in the United States, which led to the withdrawal of funds from several emerging markets; allegations that the rand was over-valued and rumours about President Nelson Mandela's health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to expect that the exchange rate in the short term will be affected by speculative capital flows. But what is more important for us in government is to focus on policy co- ordination,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is about the management of the fiscus in a different way as outlined in the budget of March 13, which will see in this fiscal year significant tightening-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would include the establishment of an expenditure evaluation unit, better collection of taxes and excise duties, the establishment of a debt management office, better cash management and &quot;generally a tightening-up of the fiscus&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On monetary policy, he said that &quot;we should avoid strangulation of the domestic economy by relying only on interest-rate hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We also have to ensure that the gains of devaluation are not eroded in the current round of (wage) negotiations which could affect the wage price cycle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel said that South Africa had to work towards policies that would allow a real effective exchange rate shaped by a range of supporting policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have our finger on the pulse; we are more than competent; we will deliver on what we promised,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Jay Naidoo, minister of posts telecommunications and broadcasting, injected some levity into the otherwise serious proceedings at this week's Information Society and Development Conference in Johannesburg.  &quot;One person, one Internet connection,&quot; became his catch phrase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first time the Group of Seven (G7) -- the leading industrial nations -- and the developing world had gathered to discuss information issues. A large number of projects, including the United States's Leland Initiative, geared to fulfill Naidoo's hopes in Africa, were launched, and decisions made regarding the priority status of some of the G7 pilot projects launched two years ago for the developing world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> US vice-president Al Gore heralded the thresholds the world was crossing as it entered the new information revolution. As his image flickered on 12 satellite screens, he said the developing world would benefit from accepting the principles laid down at the Brussels G7 convention in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tsepho Ranto, president of South Africa's National Community Media Forum, highlighted the potential areas of concern. &quot;I am more interested in what the conference is going to do for South Africa. We are interested in deliverables and we need to unpack the G7 pilot projects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's request, representatives from 40 countries and 18 international organisations converged to begin a dialogue that would attempt to bring a common understanding and collaboration between the developed and developing countries, working towards &quot;common principles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The principles call for the liberalisation of the telecommunications markets and substantial privatisation. As understood by Gore, these are private investment; &quot;robust competition; smart flexible regulation as practised by our Federal Communications Commission; open access, and universal service&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How then can these principles be translated into equitable principles for the developing world, which after all, is neither a unified constituency nor has the same set of needs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federal Communications Commission chairman Reed Hunt explained the US position. &quot;We recognise that the developed world has something to offer to the less developed world -- take South Africa's cellular technology. It has built the second-largest digital network in the world, while the US is still on analogue. The developing world simply does not have to repeat the same policy mistakes, they can go straight to the cutting edge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concerns about the protection of local markets, state regulation and control in the face of an increasing divide between a &quot;two- tier society -- of information haves and have-nots&quot; as president of the European Commission Jacques Santer pointed out, are central to the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hunt said: &quot;International communication products are unique in that they are co- operatively produced; the result is the modern network. Governments limit this growth by trying to manage this process. They should rather try to manage the entrepreneurial advantage. Telecommunications businesses grow like weeds and present the opportunity for a whole new class of trade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate is inherent in the principles, and the question is, do they add up to universal service? Hunt argues that the Chilean, Peruvian and Columbian models prove that they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By opening their market, the Chileans have introduced 12 new operators, achieved 14% market growth, and created thousands of jobs. It is a good idea to welcome foreign investment. South Africa is being cautious, and not as open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Commission appeared to take a less hard-hitting line. In his opening remarks, Santer was buoyant but practical: &quot;Let us build a fresh approach to sharing and disbursing these exciting technologies to benefit everyone. It will not be easy. Let us be honest. We are burdened with rigidities: old ways of thinking, bureaucratic inertia, institutional overlapping, conflicting priorities and new economic orthodoxies that will make direct government transfers of aid and assistance even more difficult in the future -- as we trim government expenditure. That is why public-private partnerships will be so vital in the next millennium.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But how will the developing world balance development needs with access to markets? How will it guard against merely being the recipient of aid packages in the form of interactive software, or simply becoming a large market to access?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Edwin Blake of the National Information Technology Forum asked: &quot;Will this conference serve to develop South Africa or under-develop it? Who will be served by opening ourselves up to a marketing exercise, without developing our own software and applications?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A National Information Technology Forum and Cosatu delegation member said: &quot;We must ensure that information technology is able to address social and development needs. If we simply accept the G7 principles without qualifying them, it will be disastrous. Developing countries are late-comers to the party and will only get titbits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Universal access could come to mean techno- imperialism. The information society has to have involvement from all participants, otherwise it will be a society that does not benefit everybody, and which people do not buy into. The debate between competition and liberalisation is problematic, because even developed countries have interventionist governments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call from Mbeki was clear: our preconceived notions of what is right in each context must be challenged; the urgent need to define a regulatory framework between the north and south must receive renewed attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference has laid the ground for debate, but it is clear from the chair's conclusions that the principles are now a product of a compromise position. The Brussels principles remain intact, but they are qualified by the developing world's needs for a universal service and diversity in applications and cultures, in order to ensure socio-economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the conference will have some effect in narrowing the gap is to be seen. Naidoo's point is: &quot;The issue at hand has gone beyond the aid paradigm, even though aid is an important component. The shift from commodity- based economics is redefining our perspective. Entering into dialogue is important, as it allows us to address those principles that will best address our needs, while redefining roles and entering into partnerships will help us to look at the benefits of creating jobs and providing services.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - In the world of international conferences, talk does not come cheap. It cost R18-million to host 3 000 delegates from 188 countries for the ninth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad).  But aside from re- affirming South Africa's renaissance on the international stage, what did the fortnight of talks achieve?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four years ago, at the Cartagena conference, Unctad was searching for a role. Economic power had shifted during the 1980s towards the Bretton Woods institutions -- the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) -- and Unctad's place among the international forums was under threat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the transformation of Gatt into the World Trade Organisation (WTO), there was talk of abandoning Unctad altogether. It was felt the overlap between the two organisations was too great; there was only room for one trade body. But Gatt rounds leaned heavily towards member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD); least developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries in general lacked the facilities of industrialised countries to lobby their cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Xavier Carim, deputy director of foreign trade relations at the Department of Trade and Industry, explains, Unctad is the only organisation with a mandate to operate on behalf of the developing world. And, indeed, it has played an important role in enabling a convergence between North and South on issues of trade and economic policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cartagena conference heralded the need for a new approach to development issues. &quot;We have to guard against complacency, we must be pro- active and innovative and in doing so point to concrete roles Unctad will play,&quot; said Unctad IX president and Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin at the opening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judging by the Midrand Declaration, the conference went a long way to achieving a new focus. &quot;Key advances were made in attaining greater understanding of development strategy, including the implications for development of liberalisation and globalisation,&quot; says Carim. &quot;From the extreme polarisation of views seen in the past there has been real progress towards consensus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the conference served to put Africa, as the poorest continent, back on the map. &quot;It was an important victory for the South, reinforcing the place of LDCs in the global economy,&quot; says Rob Davies, an African National Congress MP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as the next WTO meeting in Singapore nears, the importance of Unctad's role as facilitator for the LDCs, helping to put their case to the WTO, was underlined. Multilateral investment agreements are high on the agenda for the December meeting; foreign direct investment, as South Africa is well aware, is critical for economic growth. So LDCs will be looking to Unctad to emphasise the developmental objectives as well, says Carim. &quot;It is imperative that any deal reflects the interests of all developing countries and Unctad will provide that support.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa will also benefit from its reintegration into the Unctad framework -- not only from the R30-million cash injection into our economy thanks to the delegates' spending, but more importantly from the gold mine of policy research and analytical information that forms the backbone of Unctad's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, contacts made between private and public sector at the conference should bear fruit in terms of investment and trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And as president for the next four years, South Africa has ample opportunity to wield its influence and strengthen Unctad's focus. Any initial anxiety when Trevor Manuel withdrew due to the Cabinet reshuffle was dispelled as Erwin very quickly made his mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the Midrand Declaration is a significant departure from the usual UN language. While this is only the beginning, the document offers some hope that consensus will translate into action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Fuel industry players hope the African National Congress's takeover of the mineral and energy affairs portfolio, following the National Party's exit from government, will speed up reform in the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is probably going to be more action and less politicking,&quot; and &quot;there should be fewer somersaults -- Penuell Maduna won't have to be looking over his back the whole time,&quot; were the typical comments from a snap poll this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pik Botha's charm and political agility were not enough to push through the massive energy policy changes needed to bring South Africa's fuel industry out of the dark ages. As a high profile NP minister with an exclusively NP team, until the recent appointment of Susan Shabangu as deputy minister, he was often politically paralysed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a tough battle raising the crucial support needed from the finance and trade and industry departments, which have stepped up their involvement in the industry, particularly the sale of Mossgas. A three-man team, including special advisers Charles Stride and Paul Jourdan from the finance and trade and industry departments, and mineral and energy affairs director general Gert Venter, steer policy on the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP stigma also meant the department felt obliged to negotiate and consult with every interest group or &quot;stakeholder&quot; in sight, making swift decision impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha's department of 25, all NP, is badly understaffed -- a senior official recently noted that United States Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's entourage on her trip to South Africa last year was larger. And those that there are have dedicated their lives to administering the &quot;crow's nest&quot; (as Botha puts it) maze of fuel industry regulations that needed to be reformed.  Players are hopeful that Maduna will be able to breathe life into it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha announced this week that he was quitting politics, ending an extraordinary career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shake-up at mineral and energy affairs coincides with the International Energy Agency's (IEA) report on South Africa's energy sector.  The department has indicated it will refer to the report when drafting its White Paper on energy policy, and some commentators hope Maduna, currently deputy home affairs minister, will kick off by considering some of its recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency, which is part of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development, says it favours dismantling many of the &quot;complex webs&quot; of price controls and trading restrictions spawned by the sanctions era. These include fixed margins for fuel retailers, who are protected from excessive competition by the rationalisation plan that bars new entrants to the retail market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In return for these benefits, the oil companies have to tolerate state financial support to Sasol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although deregulation has been advocated by commentators who say the industry has stagnated by receiving guaranteed profits just for being in South Africa, there are many in government -- not only in mineral and energy affairs but also in trade and industry -- who favour the old regime. There is also an influential group keen on maintaining or even stepping up government involvement in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from deregulation, the other main issue facing Maduna will be the fate of the Central Energy Fund (CEF) group of companies at the heart of boycott-era oil policies. The CEF includes state exploration company Soekor and its oil trading arm, Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IEA recommends the privatisation of Soekor and says there is little justification for the country-to-country oil deals that are the SFF's bread and butter, arguing that these deals were of little use to refiners who needed to pick their oil to suit their needs. It says government support to SFF should be confined to ensuring South Africa has an adequate strategic oil stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report's portrayal of the many vested interests and cosy set-ups characterising the industry offers a stark reminder that even with his political clout Maduna's job as fuel industry reformer will not be easy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Armed with a package of incentives and reassurances of labour stability, President Sam Nujoma of Namibia was in Johannesburg this week to woo investors. On his first state visit to this country, Nujoma stressed the economic bonds between the two countries -- South Africa accounts for 80% of Namibia's imports and 35% of exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is therefore natural that we should look to South Africa, among others, for capital, technology and managerial skills as Namibia embarks on a new era of economic reconstruction and development, based on the principle and strategy of diversification of its economy,&quot; Nujomo told a business delegation in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But South African investors may not be that easily convinced. Experience has shown that not all companies are welcome -- although Hanno Rumpf, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, was quick to set the record straight. &quot;There is no law against investing in Namibia, and we welcome competition,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Breweries may beg to differ. Its plans to open a plant in Tsumeb were roundly thwarted by the local brewer and it has not made another attempt since, says Andre Parker, managing director of Indol Internationaal, SAB's international arm. The company has been approached by a consortium of Namibian investors to take a minority interest in a brewery, with SAB as the managing partner, but so far the government has yet to approve the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By contrast, says Parker, setting up in Zambia and Mozambique was no problem; indeed, SAB's international beer interests showed a 31% increase in profits in the year to end-March, with Africa playing a substantial role in that rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Namibia will have to do more than pay lip- service to free market economics,&quot; says a leading analyst. &quot;If it wants to promote foreign investment, it will have to keep politics out of business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rumpf was adamant: &quot;We are not biased against South African companies; all we want is a level playing field. In the SAB case, there was an issue of transfer pricing and unfair competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAB wonders whether he means simply competition. &quot;So far we have not been allowed to compete at all,&quot; says SAB.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Crawford, deputy chairman of RPP, says the company will not give up attempts to develop a shopping centre in Windhoek, despite the legal wrangles of the past three years. &quot;Namibia is not anti-investment,&quot; he says, &quot;we lost our application on grounds of a technicality. The problem was with the local authority and the zoning laws. We still hope to put up a centre with Pick 'n Pay in the near future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia realises it will have to offer something more if it is going to compete against South Africa in manufacturing. That's where the export processing zones (EPZ) come in: enterprises will be exempt from corporate income taxes, customs duties, sales and transfer taxes, and stamp duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, says Steve Galloway, director of the Namibia Investment Centre, the unions have recognised that the country needs foreign investment -- and that guaranteed continuity of production is vital to the process. &quot;No strikes will be tolerated,&quot; he says. In Walvis Bay, an area earmarked as an EPZ, the unions have agreed to a five-year no strike, no lock- out deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel de Castro, mayor of Walvis Bay, was excited about the possibilities. &quot;We are closer to the markets of Europe and America than Cape Town and Durban; all the necessary infrastructure is in place to make Walvis Bay a boom-town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, with the opening of the Trans-Kalahari highway, Walvis Bay will be 500km closer to Gauteng. &quot;At the end of the day, economics must dictate which port or sea route should be used for imports and exports, and in this context, Walvis Bay has definite advantages over Maputo. Regional governments and businesses should therefore take cognisance of this fact,&quot; says the mayor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - National Party insiders said this week the party was willing to sacrifice both its name and its leader, FW de Klerk, to renew the party, making it able to compete with the African National Congress in the 1999 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This dream of a &quot;New Party&quot; keeps the Nats fired up at a time when many former Cabinet members are regretting the loss of their perks. And a number of NP caucus members realise that by losing Cabinet seats the party has lost status in the eyes of black supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The older faction in the NP are rolling up their sleeves in anticipation of rough-and- tumble with the ANC in Parliament. Younger members are looking ahead to a party to eclipse the Nats' unfortunate past. Such a &quot;New Party&quot; holds the best hope for their political futures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP assistant secretary general and senator David Malatsi, 36, said this week that he saw himself playing a prominent role in the &quot;New Party&quot; -- one free of the baggage of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party strategists are reluctant to commit themselves openly to the &quot;New Party&quot; idea at this stage, but behind the smoke of opposition talk they are weighing up strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already it is said that a new party would more than likely abandon the present NP name, logo and motto. It would be the kernel of a broad political movement that would reflect the demographics of the country, and fulfil the role of a strong opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nats are expected to enter a period of &quot;introspection&quot;, according to Malatsi, culminating in a bosberaad at the end of June, during which the NP will discuss the idea further. It will then start to approach a number of groups -- including other political parties, civil and religious organisations, people &quot;with the same sort of values as the National Party&quot; -- in search of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nats have less than three years to pull this rabbit out of the hat.  The anti-defection clause in the Constitution, preventing politicians from crossing the floor, will shore them up in the national and provincial parliaments until the 1999 elections, preventing drastic changes in the political landscape until then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During that time, the Nats will be laying the ground rules for post-1999 opposition and grooming a new team of leaders of the right gender and colour.  The party is hoping to use its political academy to &quot; breed&quot; new leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We'll teach them administration, how to organise in an area, how to organise branch meetings, how to participate in debates so that they do not get a shock when they come to Parliament. Parliament was quite a culture shock to some people ... they were vociferous outside, but then came in here and quietened down,&quot; said Malatsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the Nats are going to have to apply their minds to wooing black votes. A senior NP source admitted this week that the NP, despite its electoral forays into black areas, still did not understand the black electorate and had no idea what was going down in the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malatsi agrees: &quot;The politicians can't just come in at election time and make promises and think that they will get the vote. They must work with the people. For example, the National Party must send some of its support people -- lawyers, doctors, builders -- and help the black people in the townships over the weekends. They must be there in their hour of need. Then they will vote for the National Party, for people who help them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malatsi contributes to a soup kitchen out of his own pocket, and his wife does social work with the aged. He is also concerned about communication with black people. When the Nats pulled out of government, he got an anxious call from his wife asking what they would do now that he had forfeited his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I have to explain in my own home that withdrawing from Cabinet does not mean leaving Parliament, imagine how many people out there got the wrong idea,&quot; he said. He said he had received many complaints from black NP supporters about the NP's withdrawal -- people who felt the party was shirking its responsibility to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While waiting to mature into legitimacy, Nat MPs are going to be developing their oppositional muscle -- and many admit it is not going to be easy. Already they have targeted the economy as he main site of struggle, although ANC secretary-general Marthinus van Schalkwyk noted this week that NP economic policy was 99% the same as the Democratic Party's. Other opposition parliamentarians are sceptical about what an opposition can achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Freedom Front MP Corne Mulder said: &quot;There are only so many tricks in the book of the opposition -- you can walk out, you can hand over a memorandum, you can get very angry at press conferences, but that's about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DP leader Tony Leon asked, &quot;If Inkatha can be in Cabinet and be an opposition party, why can't they?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare - The Zimbabwean government's recent raid on the Zimbabwe Mass Media Trust is a worrying benchmark in the life of the national press, and sends ambiguous signals about the ruling party's commitment to continuing a programme of political liberalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 15 years the trust was paraded by President Robert Mugabe's government as concrete proof that Zimbabwe would not go the way of many neighbouring countries in crushing the standard-bearers of freedom of speech and mercilessly reining in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So the surprise announcement by Director of Information Bornwell Chakaodza that the trustees had acceded to the government's demand for an effective veto over a supervisory role within the organisation came as a shock -- particularly because the same official had recently marked World Press Freedom Day by declaring Zimbabwe &quot;an oasis of press freedom&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These moves involving the amendment of the trust's founding deed come after several years of government attempts to undermine, marginalise and otherwise weaken the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1981 the non-partisan trust was set up by the government to manage the majority shareholding in Zimpapers, the country's only national newspaper chain, which until then had been controlled by Argus. At independence, the government was anxious to remove the South African presence in the national press, but was sensitive about alienating skilled locals and potential investors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trust emerged as an innovative solution, combining public ownership with politically independent management. A board of trustees was appointed and made self-perpetuating; and the government claimed it would have no further direct operative role in the body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a while it seemed to work. However, Zanu (PF) wasted little time in undercutting and surrounding the trust, by fostering a culture of financial and managerial dependence on the Ministry of Information, and ensuring the ruling party's influence inside trust- controlled media with the help of strategically placed party adherents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As it happened, this combination of pressures, and especially Zanu (PF's) back-door access to Zimpapers and Ziana (the national news agency also placed under the trust's control in 1981), made the trust mostly irrelevant as a key media player within a few years of independence. When ruling party leaders ordered a series of editorial dismissals at Zimpapers starting in 1985, trustees were given no space to intervene, and were informed that firings and hirings were a &quot;company matter&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past there was always the hypothetical possibility of calling the editors of the partisan Zimpapers to account, by appealing to the tenets of fair play and tolerance set forth by the trust. Now even that small space for principled intervention has collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Many people used to give Zimpapers the benefit of the doubt because the trust was there&quot;, says Judith Todd, a campaigner for press freedom and one-time member of the Zim- papers board of directors. &quot;They argued that claims of government control of Zimpapers were exaggerated. The very fact the trust was there made people think twice. No longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Simba Makoni, Zimpapers' managing director, has yet to see the revisions to the trust deed. The first he heard of the matter was a brief news item on the front page of the Sunday Mail and, despite his inquiries, there has been nothing since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mass Media Trust itself has not commented. Observers are now wondering if this is a sign of resistance -- or submission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Saunders is an academic specialising in Zimbabwe media matters and is concluding a book on the Mass Media Trust</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> @ Uganda has a new president -- or is he?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YOU could be forgiven for thinking Uganda has a new president. Yoweri Museveni won a landslide victory in last weekend's election under a surname -- Kaguta -- which he had reduced to a mere initial since his youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He rediscovered its full potency when he realised that being known as Museveni would place him in the middle of the ballot paper. As Kaguta, his was the first of the three names on the list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tactic might have been a little risky had it not been for the large photograph by which many voters identified their man. But it was seen in some quarters as further evidence that, far from being a convinced democrat, Museveni is treading a well-worn and dangerous path.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Americans are leading the charge to warn that he is heading towards the kind of one- party dictatorship the continent knows only too well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the heart of the issue is Museveni's ban on multiparty politics. He has long argued that party politics would rub salt into the wounds of the ethnic and religious divisions that lie behind the country's decades of bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Michael Southwick, the United States ambassador to Kampala, is having none of it. Although Museveni has yet to tell the Ugandan public, he has informed Western envoys that he would like to maintain the &quot;no-party state&quot; for at least another 15 years. Southwick argues that if Ugandans are not permitted free political activity, it will marginalise alternative voices and eventually lead to a new era of repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you keep it locked up in a bottle you risk an explosion, because it will take increasing repression to control. Eventually Museveni has to come around because the donor base of support will be lost, and with that will go confidence and investment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides the implicit threat to cut off aid, the US suggests that Uganda's economy is less sound than is widely thought. Even though it has grown faster than any other in Africa in recent years, the US points out that foreign donors remain crucial, as they meet about 40% of government spending.  Other countries, including Britain, have increasingly come round to challenging the party politics ban, although less stridently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ugandans counter that the US is trying to impose its own political ideology. And according to Museveni's chief political commissar, Eryra Kategaya, the US ambassador is not doing it very subtly: &quot;I don't think he's a democrat. He treats us like a small boy. He lectures us, and very rudely too. He doesn't want to listen to other points of view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kategaya argues that, if party politics is not the root of all Uganda's evils, it certainly helped bring them to the fore. &quot;There is a tendency here for political groups to exploit the miseries of groups for their own ends.  They make the place impossible to govern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election campaign reinforced Museveni's point. Uganda's two main political parties, which are legal but forbidden to operate, are the same ones that existed through the years of terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni campaigned on two linked themes: that his government has produced 10 years of stability and growth after nearly 20 years of barbarity and incompetence under Idi Amin and Milton Obote, and that Africa must develop its own democratic systems which emphasise consensus-seeking, not confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither did the opposition do much to allay fears that politicians widen the schisms in society. Among other dubious charges, Museveni's opponents accused him of introducing Aids in the north to wipe out the Acholi people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the US warnings that foreign aid could be in jeopardy, it seems unlikely that the US or its allies want to bring one of Africa's success stories crashing down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all its problems, Uganda remains the most stable country in the region. Zaire is slowly imploding, Rwanda is struggling to recover from genocide with the threat of another war hanging over it, Tanzania's economy is in the doldrums, and to the north is the US's new pariah, Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But perhaps it is Uganda's eastern neighbour which offers the best evidence that intent is all-important. President Daniel arap Moi was forced down the multiparty route, but Kenya can hardly be considered a democracy.  There is freedom of speech for those prepared to risk arrest and beatings.  Opposition political parties are constantly harassed. Their supporters are even murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Uganda, the only known politically related detainee during the elections was a man who called Museveni a bastard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l There were only 100 independent observers for 15 000 voting stations in the elections, according to some political analysts monitoring the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts who had predicted a close call for Museveni are sceptical that those who monitored the elections were qualified to call the polls free and fair, given the sparseness of observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were also reports that the military, obviously loyal to Museveni, had separate polling stations which did not come under any scrutiny at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Defence Minister Joe Modise could end up in the dock on charges arising from Umkhonto weSizwe's Magoo Bar bomb which killed three civilians in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KwaZulu-Natal Attorney General Tim McNally confirmed this week he had reopened investigations into the case after bomber Robert McBride said he had planted the car bomb under orders from his superiors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McBride was a member of Umkhonto weSizwe's (MK) special operations unit that carried out some of the organisation's more spectacular guerrilla attacks in the Eighties -- and fell directly under Modise's command at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McBride has refused to name those who gave him the orders. According to research conducted by the Institute for Defence Policy, however, all &quot;special projects&quot; carried out by this unit required the &quot;green light&quot; from MK's high command.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McBride told the Mail &amp; Guardian last week he had received instructions from &quot;the person in charge of special operations&quot; in Gaberone, but would not name the individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modise was commander-in-chief of Umkhonto weSizwe at the time of the Durban beachfront bombing in 1986. The research indicates that Lambert Moloi, now a general in the South African National Defence Force, was in charge of planning and executing special operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He would have worked closely with Abu-Baker Ismail, now also a general in the SANDF, and Cassius Make. These men were in charge of ordnance and supply of weaponry to special operations teams. Make was assassinated in Swaziland in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked if he would prosecute everyone involved in this chain of command, including the defence minister, McNally told the M&amp;G: &quot;We would have to evaluate the evidence. We will follow it to wherever it leads ... Nobody is above the law and the law is above everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNally appears determined to investigate the case as a matter of urgency and sent a special investigator to interview McBride in Pretoria, where he works as a deputy director in the Department of Foreign Affairs, on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But McBride is not sure whether he will give evidence, even if subpoenaed. &quot;I have not had time to think this over,&quot; said McBride. He added that McNally's decision to reopen the prosecution in connection with the Durban bombing begged the question of why McNally had &quot;moved so fast&quot; in this case while apparently paying less attention to other cases raised in evidence before the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked to comment on the AG's announcement, Kasrils told the M&amp;G the ANC was busy compiling its submission to the truth commission and this would deal with &quot;actions such as those carried out by Robert McBride&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All members of MK involved in planning, commanding or carrying out the actual operation fall within the ambit of this submission. The leadership has taken collective responsibility for the conduct of our combatants in the course of the armed struggle,&quot; said Kasrils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rank-and-file operatives will not be left to take responsibility alone. Political responsibility is accepted for all cadres even though we know that in the course of the liberation struggle anomolies may have arisen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Robert McBride was an outstanding member of MK who has served a sentence and been given indemnity. It is an absolute injustice to repeatedly drag him through an ordeal for which he has been punished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's position differs markedly from that of other political parties, including the National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party, whose leaders have distanced themselves from foot soldiers implicated in human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers believe McNally has placed the revived Magoo inquiry on to an urgent footing in order to show even-handedness in his determination to prosecute past political crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The KwaZulu-Natal AG is currently heading the state's case against former defence minister Magnus Malan and 19 other security force officers in connection with the 1987 KwaMakutha massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC will point out there is no mirror image between the two cases.  Its cadres are willing to go before the truth commission and tell all while Malan and his co-suspects have refused to co-operate with the truth process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modise and others are likely to testify before the truth commission, which would be necessary if they were to secure amnesty before McNally begins the prosecution. Asked whether he would consider going before the commission himself, McBride replied: &quot;I have no business to go to the truth commission.  People who want amnesty will apply for it,&quot; adding he did not see how his testimony could help the amnesty applications of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While McBride, like Kasrils, maintains he has been indemnified, the Justice Department says McBride never received amnesty on his release from prison. Piet Kleynhans, head of the Justice Department's indemnity office, said the Amnesty Act of 1990 applied only to people who were awaiting trial or who had never been charged. People in McBride's position who had already been convicted were granted remission of sentence, but not amnesty, Kleynhans said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McBride insists that he was indeed granted amnesty: &quot;Why was I allowed to stand for public office when convicted criminals are not allowed to stand for public office?&quot; said McBride, who served as a Gauteng MPL before taking up his present position in the Department of Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Kleynhans explained the Electoral Act, which used to exclude convicted criminals from running for office, had been amended before the 1994 elections to accommodate the fact that many candidates who were active in the liberation movements -- including Nelson Mandela -- had been convicted under various laws without being granted amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although not indemnified, McBride is not liable for further prosecution since he has already been tried, convicted and sentenced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - In the excitement over the passing of the Constitution last week and the withdrawal of the Nationalists from government, a small but significant moment of history went almost unnoticed --- when Deputy President Thabo Mbeki planted a flag on the summit of his political career, laying unmistakable claim to the presidency of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki's &quot;Africanist&quot; speech --- celebrating unity in diversity --- startled listeners, bringing many close to tears. It was poetic and moving, a speech of presidential authority which was almost visionary in tone and worthy of an inauguration address. But to some it was a parody of all those things; a self-serving move by an ambitious man grabbing for the mantle of supreme power with a transparent appeal to the emotions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the gulf between those two perceptions lies the mystery of a man who must now be seen as South Africa's future. Because, in the wake of Chris Hani's death and Cyril Ramaphosa's retreat from the party political battle field, there is only one answer to that question which has haunted South Africa's body-politic: is there life after Mandela? There is, and it is Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the answer presents another question: who exactly is this little man that we all know so well, and yet not at all? An intensely private and complex personality, Mbeki presents an enigma. His political style --- a strategic thinker, a committee man who works behind the scenes rather than leading from the front in a bold, populist way --- contributes to the sense of mystery. There is an unease about him, reflected in his curious transformation from the media's darling, the persuasive articulator of the ANC's struggle against an evil political system, to its whipping boy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one spends decades in politics to emerge in the top league without making enemies. Obviously a consummate politician, he is said to have a talent for the lethal, timeous strike. He is not a pocket Mandela, but is said to have strengths Mandela himself lacks --- a breadth and depth of strategic vision, for example, and an ability to direct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His staff, who are intensely loyal to him, describe Mbeki as pragmatic, strategic, a man of vision, and the government's most clever and sophisticated politician, someone who distinguishes himself by being on top of the issues rather than relying on advisers. Stephen Ellis, former editor of Africa Confidential and now at Leyden University's Centre for African Studies, sees him as a fixer, a smoother, an arch-diplomat who builds consensus and considers every angle before moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born into a leading ANC family, he has been steeped for most of his life in liberation politics. He served his apprenticeship with Oliver Tambo, the great conciliator who held the movement together during the tough years in exile. His track record and his experience have provided him with a solid support base, held together by his skill in sewing constituencies together without identifying too closely with any one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there are no identifiable groups against him (one reason given is that heads are being kept well down), he has his critics --- as does Mandela.  He has had to fight to get where he is and has made enemies along the way. He watches his back, carefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was one of the South African Communist Party's rising stars at a time when the route to advancement in the ANC was via the party or Umkhonto weSizwe. He trained at the Lenin Institute in Moscow, was elected to the central committee and politburo ahead of his great rival, Hani, but then stopped attending meetings in what some saw as an expedient dumping of the party once he saw its days of influence were numbered. Ellis says Mbeki was forging a relationship with the Swedes at the time; he was seen as more a social democrat than a communist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is not doctrinaire, which makes sense for an ambitious politician in a movement as all- encompassing of political beliefs as the ANC. It is difficult to pin an ideological label on him, which leads critics to characterise him as a man for whatever season will secure him more power. But he has shown the courage and far-sightedness to pioneer positions initially unpopular, and the powers of persuasion to get the ANC and SACP to adopt them. Early on, he saw the government could and would talk about a deal, and held the position despite opposition. &quot;One could ask whether this is the behaviour of a man who believes in nothing,&quot; says Ellis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mojanku Gumbi, his legal adviser and an Azapo stalwart, says his commitment is to meeting the needs of the majority, rather than any ideology.  &quot;He says when the poor rise, they will rise against all of us&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his first year in office, the press turned sour, picking on missed appointments, accusing him of tardiness. His parliamentary counsellor, Essop Pahad, says Mbeki was in Morocco on ANC business for Mandela when he missed breakfast with then-French president Francois Mitterand; the French embassy knew this and issued a statement which &quot;the media chose to ignore&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vusi Mavimbela, his political adviser, sees Mbeki's bad press as a fall-back position for the media; anxious to be seen acting as a watchdog over the government, they vent their criticism on the deputy president, because the president is unassailable. He also concedes that part of the problem may be with Mbeki's communication staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of his staff will criticise Mandela. Nevertheless, they see the president, with his notorious tendency to &quot;shoot from the hip&quot;, as at times a handicap for Mbeki. Mandela will mandate his deputy to carry out a particular task and then, instead of leaving him to get on with it, hold on to the issue. &quot;Mbeki has things in train to deal with a situation and then gets derailed,&quot; says one person close to Mbeki's office. &quot;There's no way he can say so, he just has to grin and bear the fall-out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His staff indignantly defend him over his alleged &quot;blunders&quot; --- the apparent whitewash of Allan Boesak, the fumbling of Winnie Mandela's firing, the execution of Ken Saro- Wiwa in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pahad says Gumbi was mandated to review the lawyers' report on the Boesak case commissioned by the Danish funders. She found their conclusion, that the cleric had misappropriated funds, was not supported by documents the lawyers themselves used. Her finding has since been vindicated, argues Pahad, by the fact that, months after launching its own investigation, the Office for Serious Economic Offences has yet to press charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki's perceived fumbling over Winnie Mandela's dismissal --- the failure to consult Mangosuthu Buthelezi, which allowed her to succeed in the court action which led to her brief reinstatement --- is blamed on bad legal advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the Nigerian issue, his advisers point out that Mbeki, having served there, knew the political terrain and was aware Mandela's moral stature offered little leverage in Africa. He sensed the dangers in clashing head-on with Nigeria, of splitting African sentiment and ending up badly isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A message from Mbeki's office to Mandela at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in New Zealand at the time of the executions urged that, whatever action he took, the Commonwealth had to be on board. Mandela's call for sanctions is cited as a classic example of his tendency to act in the heat of the moment; South Africa found itself out on a limb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As deputy president, Mbeki has no original authority. He does what he is mandated to do by Mandela. His role has expanded, partly because of Mandela's increasing focus on reconciliation and nation-building, but also because it is now more clear what has to be done. He is de facto prime minister, in charge of the executive functioning of the government. He chairs meetings of the Cabinet, as well its Economic Affairs Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He keeps tabs on the situation in KwaZulu- Natal, deals with the problems of ANC ministers and deputy ministers, meets foreign delegations, sells South Africa at international forums like the World Economic Forum at Davos, and can also find himself on a plane at 24 hours' notice on special missions for Mandela. He has political responsibility for the government's communication arm, SACS, and the Office on the Status of Women; he is the ANC's firefighter, and often acts as de facto foreign affairs minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign diplomats express a high regard for him, describing him as &quot;one of the few in government with awareness of what's happening in different areas of government and able to put it together&quot;. He's admired for his great ability to attend to detail and to follow through, to identify and work through problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His relationship with United States Vice- President Al Gore, with whom Mbeki works on the US-SA Bi-National Commission --- the body governing relations between the two countries --- goes beyond the professional, seemingly a relatively rare thing for Gore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign diplomats are surprised by the apparent lack of staff in Mbeki's office. His staff complement grew to 63 from 50 last year; his budget is R9,3-million. Outgoing deputy president FW de Klerk, who had far fewer responsibilities, had a budget of R8-million, and his staff was reduced from 61 to 56 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki is reluctant to expand his office. &quot;He was party to the decision on the need to trim the civil service,&quot; says his economics adviser, Moss Ngoasheng. &quot;He hears ministers asking for more money, more bodies - ---it's a contradiction that has yet to be resolved. His view is that we must find creative ways to deal with the lack of capacity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A restructuring of the office is under way, says the Rev Frank Chikane, his special adviser and de facto chief of staff. It has to expand to handle RDP functions. The intention is to combine the Central Economic Advisory Services, the Central Statistical Services and the RDP development planning unit, to provide the government with the capacity for macro- economic planning to drive the growth and development strategy Mbeki unveiled in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As chair of the Cabinet's economic affairs committee, Mbeki is seen as ultimately responsible for macro-economic policy. The trajectory the economy will take is becoming the central political debate in South Africa. Labour and the left want it to move in a progressive direction, with black empowerment meaning more than a well-oiled elite. White capital wants a free market to prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said a representative of big business: &quot;There's no problem with Mbeki at an inter- personal level, but running the country goes beyond that. He hasn't asserted his leadership. In February we got a sense of where we were headed when he said we needed a 6% growth rate by 2 000. But now the growth and development strategy has gone back underground. There's a lack of co-ordination. You have Nedlac meeting on the one hand, then Mandela meeting the Brenthurst group on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were told exchange control would be relaxed, then told no. Mbeki was widely applauded when he said in December that the government would start privatising state assets. Then he got rolled back by Cosatu. Will the ANC or Cosatu be determining economic policy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key issues big business wants addressed are exchange control, privatisation and fiscal policy. Ngoasheng acknowledges the pressure, but maintains these do not amount to economic policy in themselves and maintains that key planks of policy are already in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Money has been committed to small and medium enterprises, tariff reform policy is in place, so is the trade liberalisation programme, though the pace may be debated. We've seen major reform in labour relations with the Labour Relations Act, with Nedlac and the Labour Market Commission (which he co- chairs).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government is committed to the gradual abolition of exchange control, while trade and industry and the Reserve Bank are working out a programme, insists Ngoasheng. A ministerial committee and task team are looking at the issue of restructuring state assets. In terms of reducing the deficit, &quot;the fundamentals are in place&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even his fiercest critics acknowledge and respect Mbeki's brilliance with words. He was Tambo's speech writer, and writes all his own, as well as Mandela's key speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he is not a Mandela. He is more cautious. &quot;This can open him to criticism that he dithers, but he moves immediately where the path of action is clear,&quot; says a close associate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He has an ability to stand back, to give the Cabinet space to work. He reflects on what is being done, watches directions being taken, assesses whether impact is being made,&quot; says another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His working style sees him in his office until the early hours of the morning on a routine basis. &quot;Our job is to slow him down,&quot; says Chikane. Says Gumbi: &quot;His attention to detail unsettles one. He has a prodigious memory. He listens to what you say, unpacks it, he's very receptive to advice. He questions, he checks, he reads profusely. But there's no question that he has too much to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenges facing the country are enormous. Is Mbeki the man to lead the charge to meet them? Who else is there? Says Mavimbela: &quot;Apart from his history of involvement in the organisation, you would have to look very hard to find a better strategic thinker with the experience to envision where the ANC and government should be going.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reston - Reporting to the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committees, representatives from the Black Press and Black Churches today formed a new coalition to protest unfair African policies adopted by the United States against African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a two day legislative workshop in the nation's capitol, a &quot;Fairness Doctrine for US-Africa Policy&quot; was the theme that led to the launching of a 100,000 signature petition campaign protesting consideration of economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coming from twelve states, the conferees were from every geographical region and represented a cross section of religious denominations. Reports of Findings from fact-finding missions to Nigeria in recent months triggered a strong reaction to the pressure from the Kassebaum sub committee on Africa calling for economic sanctions against Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consultations with administration officials and members of congress resulted in a decision to seek a &quot;responsible engagement&quot; policy similar to that used by our State Department and President Clinton in the Middle East and Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We see evidence of a double standard&quot; in the way we treat Black Nations&quot; said Rev. Maurice Dawkins, Chairman of the National Coalition For Fairness in Africa Policy. &quot;China's violation of human rights does not lead to US sanctions. We give them most favored nation's status,&quot; he continued. By contrast Nigeria executes terrorists under the rule of law and we impose sanctions against them. &quot;Nigeria is only one case that we must be concerned about. The whole picture of the small amounts of foreign aid being earmarked for Africa as compared with amounts set aside for Israel and Egypt is appalling,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The groups agreed to call for a policy review of US bilateral relations with Kenya, Liberia, Ghana and Tanzania in addition to Nigeria. The suspicion that British neo-colonial racism was influencing American policymakers was voiced by some of the conferees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the battle for the mind of the President we must be prepared to fight for fairness for our African Brothers,&quot; Dawkins said. We African Americans must work for Africa as diligently as Jewish Americans work for Israel&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The following is statement by Dr. Lauren W. Yoder,<BR>Mennonite Central Committee, May 5, 1996.<BR> After ten months of living in Bujumbura and talking to both Hutu and Tutsi mid-level leaders, I am more and more convinced that the greatest contribution the international community can make in Burundi, greater than humanitarian aid, greater than development aid, is to move the political leaders toward negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently hard-liners on both sides, but particularly those from the opposition political parties, refuse to negotiate. On the one hand, some rebel leaders say that they can never negotiate until those responsible for President Ndadaye's death are brought to trial. On the other hand, Tutsi military and Uprona party leaders (including the Prime Minister) refuse to negotiate with those rebels who they claim are advocating genocide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An armed solution to the conflict would not be a true solution. On the one hand, if the current government remains in power, the situation for the Hutus remains untenable because they have limited access to university training and to positions of authority, and because their safety is not guaranteed as long as minority youth gangs (&quot;Sans Echec&quot;) are allowed to act with impunity. And the current death toll of perhaps 100/week will likely continue. On the other hand, military victory by the opposition militia groups, unless rebel leaders act with unusual restraint and wisdom, would likely lead to massacres and flight of the Tutsi population, especially when the Tutsis remember the events that took place in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, a negotiated settlement that guarantees to both ethnic groups true power-sharing, representation, and access to the army is surely essential. If the armed conflict continues, yet another generation of young people will become adults in an environment that expects impunity, flouts authority, considers human life cheap, does not respect differences, and values cruelty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community needs to demonstrate the strongest possible support for the mediation efforts of Mwalimu Julius Nyerere. He has the moral authority to bring people together, and the respect of all parties. (Other mediation efforts are in the beginning stages as well and deserve support.  For example, an initiative undertaken by Protestant church leaders is also under way to contact influential people on both sides of the conflict. It is possible that the Church would be accepted as a mediator in this convoluted struggle.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I call upon the international community to find creative ways of encouraging the antagonists to come to the table, by cajoling, using personal contacts, promising rewards, threatening sanctions of various kinds, bringing media attention to individuals, pushing for a trial for those suspected of involvement in the coup attempt in 1993, and in a variety of other ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, international actors could:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) publicly support the mediation efforts of President Nyerere,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) send high-level delegations to talk privately with leaders of all sides,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) in those private talks, offer a neutral venue for negotiations, guarantee safe-conduct and good offices, and explore ways of bringing to justice those involved in the 1993 coup,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) threaten limited, personal sanctions such as freezing personal assets and refusing to grant travel visas to leaders if they do not agree to negotiate within a given time period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I implore the appropriate actors to give wholehearted support to discovering ways to encourage, facilitate and demand a mediated settlement to the conflict in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to Lt. General Omar Hassan al-Bashir. president of Sudan, May 14, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is alarmed by the detention of four journalists with state-owned Sudanese Television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In late April security forces arrested Ismael Muhammad al-Hussein, the television station's news director, Hussein Saleh and Abbas Suleiman, news editors, and Osama Ghandi, a cameraman. All four journalists were taken into custody at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one has heard from the journalists since their arrest three weeks ago. Colleagues fear that they are being held in &quot;ghost houses,&quot; clandestine detention centers where prisoners are routinely tortured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan organization of journalists dedicated to the defense of our colleagues' rights throughout the world, CPJ fears that Messrs.  al-Hussein, Saleh, Suleiman and Ghandi were arrested for exercising their right to free expression, upheld by Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Their arrest constitutes a violation of the principles of the Declaration of Sana'a on Promoting Independent and Pluralistic Arab Media, which were agreed upon by journalists from the entire Arab world, and endorsed by the UN and UNESCO. CPJ respectfully urges Your Excellency to order the immediate release of al-Hussein, Saleh, Suleiman and Ghandi,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to Colonel Maawiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, president of the Republic of Mauritania on May 14, 1996.<BR> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) is deeply concerned about the banning of the independent weekly &quot;Mauritanie Nouvelles&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 9, the Ministry of the Interior ordered the publication and distribution of &quot;Mauritanie Nouvelles&quot; suspended for three months. The government accused the weekly of having &quot;sowed subversion and harmed the interests of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In March, two issues of &quot;Mauritanie Nouvelles&quot; were seized at the printing house by order of the Ministry of the Interior. In both instances no official explanation was offered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a nonpartisan organization of journalists devoted to the defense of our colleagues' rights throughout the world, CPJ fears that &quot;Mauritanie Nouvelles&quot; has been suspended in retaliation for its independent coverage of Mauritanian politics. We believe the banning contravenes Article 19 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human and violates of the principles of the Declaration of Sana'a on Promoting Independent and Pluralistic Arab Media. which were agreed upon by journalists from the entire Arab world, and endorsed by the UN and UNESCO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CPJ respectfully urges Your Excellency to permit &quot;Mauritanie Nouvelles&quot; to resume publishing immediately and without fear of future government harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The following is the &quot; Democracy Action Update&quot; on Nigeria from the Africa Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Municipal Campaign Takes Off As New York City Council Condemns<BR>Nigeria Dictatorship, Supports Sanctions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York is the first U.S. city to publicly condemn the Nigerian military dictatorship and call for U.S. economic sanctions. On February 6 the City Council voted unanimously for a Nigeria democracy resolution introduced by Bronx council member Wendell Foster. The action followed a briefing on the political and human rights crisis in the west African nation by The Africa Fund and Nigerian pro-democracy activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council heard testimony from over a dozen Nigerian and U.S. human rights activists, including Owens Wiwa, the brother of executed Nigerian environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa; Hafsat Abiola, the daughter of the jailed winner of Nigeria's annulled 1993 Presidential election; Chief Ralph Obioha, U.S. representative for the Nigerian National Democratic Coalition; former New York City Mayor David N. Dinkins, and Africa Fund Executive Director Jennifer Davis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The City Council measure urges members of the New York State Congressional delegation to co-sponsor legislation before Congress that would impose limited U.S. economic sanctions against the dictatorship. The resolution notes that Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha is almost entirely dependent on oil sales to finance his regime. This leaves Abacha extremely vulnerable to economic pressure from the United States, which purchases nearly half of Nigeria's annual production. The US is by far the single largest consumer of Nigerian crude, purchasing over $4 billion worth of the oil in 1994 alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa last November outraged and disgusted the American people,&quot; said Davis. &quot;In the months ahead we will see many more initiatives like the New York City Council resolution as concerned Americans become more informed and more active on behalf of human rights and democracy in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Orleans became the second city to adopt a Nigeria democracy resolution in April 3. The measure, introduced by Council Member Roy Glapion, is similar to New York s and also passed unanimously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Africa Fund is distributing the resolutions to elected officials across the country as part of its national campaign to inform the American public about repression in Nigeria and U.S. government and private sector policies that put oil profits ahead of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Nigeria Democracy Action Update goes to press the Oakland City Council has scheduled a hearing on an ordinance that would impose municipal sanctions on U.S. and European companies operating in Nigeria. The legislation could deny lucrative city contracts to companies like Shell, Mobil and Chevron, who together generate almost all of the revenue needed to finance the Abacha dictatorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If passed by the full council later this month, Oakland would be the first U.S. city to impose sanctions on the Nigerian military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Students To Harvard: Divest Now!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In November the Harvard University's Undergraduate Student Assembly became the first student body to demand that their university sell its stock in companies operating in Nigeria. The students acted after the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other human rights activists were hanged by a special military court for protesting the Shell Oil Company's environmental and pro-military policies. The Harvard resolution is widely seen as a model for action on other campuses, targeting not just university investments but also university contracts with U.S. oil companies in Nigeria.  Activists Launch Shell Boycott U.S. environmentalists have launched a national campaign to force the Shell Oil Company out of Nigeria. A coalition of environmental groups, including The Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, the Rivers Action Network and others plan informational pickets of Shell gas stations this Spring. Environmental groups in Washington worked with TransAfrica and Amnesty International on a special Congressional showing of the powerful British documentary film &quot;Delta Force&quot; about Ken Saro-Wiwa and Shell Oil in Nigeria. European environmental and human rights groups are targeting Shell s London shareholder meeting in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Socially Responsible Investors Take Up Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A group of socially responsible investors that includes the Teamsters, Carpenters and Service Employees unions, the National Council of Churches' Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and the Franklin Research and Development Corporation filed shareholder resolutions on Nigeria at the two largest U.S. producers of Nigerian oil, Mobil and Chevron, early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After negotiations between investors and the company, Mobil's resolutions were withdrawn in exchange for further talks on Mobil's Nigerian operations. The resolutions, which raise questions about corporate human rights, environmental and labor practices in Nigeria, will be introduced at Chevron's shareholder meeting in San Francisco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # State Legislators Just Say No To Abacha Lobbyists, Bogus Elections</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In March leaders of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators (NBCSL) turned down a trip to Nigeria when they learned that the visit was sponsored by the Abacha dictatorship. A paid lobbyist for the regime, Black conservative Maurice Dawkins, tried to persuade the legislators to travel to Nigeria to observe local government elections denounced as fraudulent and irrelevant by the Nigerian democratic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last December, in its first action on Nigeria, the NBCSL adopted a resolution condemning the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and supporting democracy. When NBCSL leaders informed Africa Fund Projects Director Dumisani Kumalo about the invitations, he provided International Affairs Committee Chair Alice Palmer and over 100 other key NBCSL members with information about the anti-democratic nature of the Nigerian elections, including the ban on opposition parties and the absence of secret ballots. He also alerted legislators to Dawkins past lobbying work for Angolan rebel Jonas Savimbi, an ally of apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> California State Senator Diane Watson, who had been asked to lead the group, was among the NBCSL leaders who turned down the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The NBCSL has just said no to Abacha's blood money,&quot; said Kumalo. &quot;And by saying no to Abacha they are saying yes to the Nigerian people who are fighting for freedom and human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # AFL-CIO Rights Award To Nigerian Strike Leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AFL-CIO has given the George Meany Human Rights Award to imprisoned Nigerian oil workers union leader Frank Kokori. Kokori led the 1994 oil workers strike for democracy and has been held without charge or trial at a secret location for over 17 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The action was taken by the federation s Executive Council at its February meeting and reflects American labor's growing activism on Nigeria.  On January 25 the government arrested another oil workers leader, Milton Dabibi, when he returned home from an extended trip to the United States and Europe. Dabibi attended the September AFL-CIO convention in New York and spent considerable time with union leaders in Washington. The federation has called for a full embargo of Nigerian oil imports to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oil Companies Arm, Pay Nigerian Security Forces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New questions about corporate involvement with the brutal Nigerian military government were raised in January when court papers revealed that the Shell Oil Company was purchasing weapons for a special police unit assigned to guard the oil industry. The scandal became public after a Nigerian arms dealer sued Shell over non-payment for a shipment of the guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement admitting the company's role in arming Abacha's security forces, Shell charged that all oil companies, in Nigeria, including Mobil and Chevron, purchase weapons for the police. Shell also asserted that the companies paid the salaries of their Nigerian police forces. Both Mobil and Chevron, respectively the second and third largest producers of Nigerian oil after Shell, denied that they supplied arms to the Nigerian police. Mobil, however, did admit to The Africa Fund that it paid the salaries and other expenses of the police who guard Mobil facilities. Chevron's representative refused to comment on whether it too had Nigerian security personnel on its payroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is disgraceful that the oil companies are arming and paying Abacha's security forces,&quot; said Africa Fund Trade Union and Human Rights Coordinator Michael Fleshman. &quot;Chevron can stonewall on its ties to the regime, but I don't think the American people will do business with corporations that are bankrolling the dictatorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For more information, contact Africa Fund Human Rights Coordinator Michael Fleshman, 17 John Street, New York, NY 10038 (212) 962-1210.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Text of prepared statement on Burundi by Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser on May 14, following talks with top government officials and representatives of local and international organizations in Bujumbura. Lake's itinerary also includes Kigali, Rwanda and Nairobi, Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burundi is in a race between hope and fear. You the people of this country, have a choice: peace and the beauty of a normal life for each of your people -- or destruction, even genocide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of people are dying every week. The crisis is already under way. It could get far worse. This must not be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our message has been simple: the bloodshed and the killing must stop.  Extremism on all sides must be stopped. Power cannot be won on the battlefield in Burundi. The battlefield leads only to more killing and the isolation of this nation from the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The way back from the brink of catastrophe is to end the fighting and start discussions immediately. The people of Burundi and their leaders must decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have had productive meetings with government leaders today. They have worked hard for peace under very difficult circumstances. They have urged moderation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace must begin with your leaders, both inside and outside of government. They must continue to resist calls for violence and revenge and demonstrate by example their commitment to dialogue and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who advocate violence must understand they will only destroy the future of Burundi -- and their own, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, if they are prepared to abandon violence, we can tell them this: they will have a place at the table. And the United States and the international community will support the Burundian people in every way we can -- politically and economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If they refuse and the killing persists, or if any group seizes power by force, you should know that the United States will see to it that they are isolated by the international community and feel the full weight of international law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is one certainty: continued violence will destroy all. The security of one group cannot be purchased through the suffering of another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only solution is to share power in a way that preserves democracy and protects the human rights of all groups, whether the majority or the minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My conversations here have shown me, once again, that the vast majority of Burundians understand that violence solves nothing and threatens everybody. Their desire for peace must not be frustrated by the fanaticism of a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I came here on behalf of the United States to stand with those working for peace and also with those who will make the choice for peace before it is too late. To all of them we say: Vous avez notre soutien. Vous etes nos amis.  Vous pouvez reussir. Pour sauver le Burundi, il faut reussir. (You have our support. You are our friends. You can succeed. To save Burundi, you have to succeed).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Question and answers on Liberia from U.S. Department of State briefing on May 14, 1996, conducted by State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Is there anything you can say about the Liberian refugees?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: There certainly is, and I'm glad you asked about that because that is a very grave situation still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I can tell you that Deputy Secretary Strobe Talbott spoke last night with President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana. Deputy Secretary Talbott made a very strong appeal to President Rawlings and the Ghanaian Government that Ghana do the right thing and accept these poor people who have been adrift on the seas for ten days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I'm very pleased to report this morning that President Rawlings directed that the freighter Bulk Challenge, which had been sent out to the sea again, be allowed to return to the port of Takoradi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We understand that throughout the course of the day the many, many people on board that ship have been allowed off the freighter, and the Government of Ghana plans to move these refugees to a temporary transit site near the port of Takoradi until a more permanent site is identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We would like to congratulate the Government of Ghana for having acted appropriately, for having done the right thing, in a humanitarian sense, and for having upheld its own commitments to various international agreements on refugee conventions and refugee concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These people spent ten days in a ship in desperately overcrowded conditions without adequate food or medical attention or sanitary conditions.  A number of them were women and children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has a large group on the scene.  The UNHCR is coordinating the international relief activities with the Government of Ghana, with the Red Cross, with various non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have informed both the UNHCR and the Government of Ghana that we are available to help both of them. We have several members of our Embassy staff from Accra on the scene at Takoradi as well as our refugee coordinator -- Jim Kelly -- for West Africa, with several members of his staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're very concerned about these people. We want to do our part to help them, and we're ready to help these international organizations do the job that now must be done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to that, there are other freighters with refugees on board.  There is a fishing vessel with as many as 700 people on board off the coast of Sierra Leone. The latest information that we have is that the Government of Sierra Leone has allowed this vessel to dock but has not allowed the people off the ship. Instead, the Government of Sierra Leone is asking that provisions be brought on board the ship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We would ask the Government of Sierra Leone to do what it can to let those people off who require urgent medical attention and, in essence, to also perhaps replicate the good example today of the Government of Ghana in trying to deal with a very tragic refugee situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: How would the Liberian refugees go about applying for admission to the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: The process of admission to the United States as a refugee is straightforward. You have to first meet with an official of an American Embassy -- and there are officials on the ground -- and you have to basically meet the qualifications to become a refugee. In general, that's fear of persecution in the country from which you are fleeing. That's a process with which we have a lot of experience. If there are people in that condition, of course, there are people -- as I said, there's our refugee coordinator for West Africa who is on the ground at Takoradi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: What has the United States specifically promised Ghana in terms of assistance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: We have told the Government of Ghana that in this particular situation, dealing with the freighter in question here, we are ready to listen to their request for our assistance to the Government of Ghana but also, specifically, to the UNHCR. Assistant Secretary Phyllis Oakley has had a number of discussions with the UNHCR to see what we can do to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're in a position of wanting to be helpful, and we will be helpful once they tell us what the requirements are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: But is our offer only to give them refugee-related assistance, or have we promised Ghana some other kind of country-specific assistance?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: I'm not aware of addition promises beyond two. One is that there are immediate humanitarian needs -- food, medicine -- that need to be met.  We'll contribute to that as we can and as they request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two, there may be a request to look at some of these people as potential refugees to the United States. Of course, that's a legal process. I explained to Mark, in general, what that process is. We've not made any commitments as to numbers of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't believe the Government of Ghana or the UNHCR has yet gotten down to the specific task of trying to decide which countries would take how many refugees, and so forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Has the government offered Ghana, say, some foreign assistance for itself or some weapon sales or anything?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: I'm not aware that we have. I can check, but I'm just not aware we have from the conversations we've had in the last 24 hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: It seems to me that Ghana has been more magnanimous toward refugees than the United States has been.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: How so, George?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Well, when you consider that the centerpiece of this Administration's policy towards Caribbean refugees -- you know, from Haiti and from Cuba -- has been to send them back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: You're talking about Cuba. I wouldn't compare the situations in either Cuba or Haiti to the situation of Liberian refugees. If you look at the numbers, refugee admission numbers worldwide, the United States does its part worldwide, and we do a lot more than most countries. We've had a great tradition of that in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact is we've done a lot of good for Haiti. We made the right decision in trying to stabilize the situation of the boat people, and we've made a difference in Haiti over the last two years. I think you know the situation in Cuba better than I do, and we think that the situation is best managed by the agreement that we put into place last May 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Well, you know, there are boatloads of desperate refugees from those countries who are returned, and I'm just drawing a distinction between that and what the United States --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: And we've sheltered many of those refugees at Guantanamo, and we've provided for their existence, for their shelter, for their food, for their medical attention. We've tried in a minority of cases to provide for settlement in third countries. For those who have returned to Cuba, we check up on them regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have done a very thorough job in a humanitarian sense as well as in a legal sense in trying to do the right thing by the refugees in our own hemisphere. I don't know a country that's been more responsive over the last 100 years to refugees as has the United States. I think we have a good record here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think we also have had a right over the last week to call upon West African governments to adhere to their own international commitments on refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: How many staffers -- American staffers are on hand to process those refugee applications?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: As I said, there's our Coordinator for West Africa, Jim Kelly, with several assistants, and there are a couple of Embassy officials from our Embassy in Accra. I wouldn't give you the feeling that somehow this is all going to happen very rapidly. This takes time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think the immediate need here is for the Government of Ghana to get these people into the temporary camp and then to a more permanent camp while their future status can be adjudicated. Whether they elect to return to Liberia should the situation stabilize there, whether they choose to try to go to a third country like the United States, that's a decision that each of these individuals must make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's not a question of taking people off the boat -- I know you know this -- today and then turning them around on a boat to the United States tomorrow. It's a lot more complicated than that. They have to decide what they want to do for their own future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: As a policy matter, does the United States feel it has more of an obligation to the Liberian refugees than to refugees or citizens of other African countries just because of our historic ties to Liberia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: When it comes to deciding on the numbers of people that you take for refugees from any given country, that's worked out here in the government, and it's worked out for a variety of reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of Liberia, I think we in general feel a historic responsibility, given the fact that Liberia was founded by Americans, by freed American slaves, in the 19th century. I don't know, however, Mark, if that translates into greater numbers in terms of refugees. It's mainly worked out on a regional basis. Of course, there are very important and delicate negotiations with the Congress on the numbers from each region, as you know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Q: Are there circumstances in which the U.S. military ships off of Liberia might be involved in helping the refugees move from one spot to another?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BURNS: The American naval vessels off the coast of Monrovia are there to provide for assistance to our Embassy and, in the contingency that the situation should worsen in Liberia, to any possible evacuation of our Embassy or, in addition, of foreigners there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We did our part in evacuating more than 2,500 people over the last six weeks, most of them foreigners, not American citizens. In this particular case, you had a freighter with several thousand Africans on board -- mainly Liberians but comprising various other nationalities -- you had that freighter in an Ivoirian port; you had the freighter in a Ghanaian port.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think it was certainly just more pragmatic because the freighters were in African ports for the African countries themselves to decide that they had to step forward to help these people. Had it been otherwise, had this freighter sailed out to our vessels, then we would have been in a position of having to make a decision about what to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the fact was that these freighters were never really on the high seas. They were hugging the coastline, looking for refuge from the governments involved, and fortunately the Ghanaian Government has done the right thing here.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The security situation in Burundi and Rwanda, two former Belgian colonies scarred by conflict between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, continues to slide towards anarchy despite recent international efforts to bring an end to the persistent ethnic slaughters in the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports of new massacres, further population displacements and disruption of humanitarian assistance abound in the tiny central African nations that are ranked among the world's Least Developed Countries (LDCs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During an official visit to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi last month, UN Secretary General Boutros-Ghali made an urgent appeal on April 30 for an end to escalating violence in Burundi and strengthened dialogue there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN statement said the secretary general, who was in the Kenyan capital from April 28, gave &quot;two urgent messages&quot; to Marc Faguy, his embattled special representative in Burundi, to be delivered to Hutu President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Tutsi Prime Minister Antoine Nduwayo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faguy, a Canadian, was under fire from the Tutsi-dominated United Party for National Progress (UPRONA), which shares fragile power with the Hutu-dominated Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UPRONA president Charles Mukasi had demanded earlier last month that Faguy be fired, accusing him of lying, and of supporting dialogue with Hutu guerrillas who are attacking civilians and clashing with the Tutsi-dominated army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ntibantunganya also appealed 10 days earlier for talks between all factions, but UPRONA is adamantly opposed to talks with the guerrillas, accusing them of genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Faguy briefed Boutros-Ghali on the situation in the central African country, and on recent inconclusive talks in Tanzania between UPRONA and FRODEBU, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those talks were held under the chairmanship of former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, who warned the participants, according to conference sources, that the guerrillas could win the civil war if no talks were held with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, reports of massacres have continued in Burundi, with Burundi's militant Hutus on May 5 accusing the country's Tutsi- dominated army of slaughtering more than 200 civilians in operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But humanitarian sources contacted by telephone in the Burundi capital, Bujumbura were unable to directly confirm reports about the civilian massacres in Buhoro, central Burundi, in revenge for an attack by Hutu militants, although such reports had reached them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 5, Burundi's national radio had reported that five people, including four patients, had also died overnight when rebel Hutus attacked a hospital in Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 100 Hutu rebels attacked the Kamenge university hospital, in the northeast of the capital close to the hills where the rebels are hiding, apparently in search of medical supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The hospital's director, Dr. Juma Kariburyo, cited by the radio station, said a security guard had his throat cut and four patients died in shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attackers raided medical cabinets and food supplies, witnesses said.  Unconfirmed reports said the attack ended when a unit of the Burundi army, based nearby, intervened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) - Doctors Without Borders, protested the attack and called on both sides in the Burundi conflict to respect the neutrality of medical centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In April, two health centres in southern Burundi, at Makamba and Rutovu, were raided by rebel Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement released in Geneva on May 4, the International Committee of the Red Cross denounced the attack calling it a 'serious violation&quot; of international humanitarian law, which states that all medical facilities, their staff and patients &quot;must be strictly respected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Clashes between the Hutu guerrillas and the Tutsi-dominated army have left hundreds dead in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethnic violence erupted in Burundi in October 1993 when Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first elected president from the Hutu majority, was assassinated in an abortive coup attempt by the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death toll in 1995 was put at about 30 a day. The current fighting is raising fears of all-out civil war in this tiny central African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, ethnic slaughter continues unabated as defeated Hutu militiamen continue their struggle to overthrow the new minority Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) of the ruling Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), with genocide being alleged on both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 7, at least 86 people were killed by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan army in a prison escape attempt last month at Muramba in northwest Rwanda, a Hutu refugee group said on May 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rally for Return and Democracy in Rwanda (RDR) said reliable sources had spoken of 86 people confirmed dead in the incident on April 10, and unconfirmed figures went up to 153.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Rwandan army spokesman said on April 29 that the death toll was 19, comprising inmates of the jail, &quot;infiltrated elements&quot; who had tried to free them, and their accomplices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He denied reports that the army had killed innocent civilians, as alleged by United Nations human rights observers, who put the number of those killed at around 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muramba is near refugee camps in neighbouring Zaire populated by Hutus who fled Rwanda in the wake of the 1994 massacres of more than half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They include former Hutu soldiers and militia who are accused by the authorities in Kigali of carrying out guerrilla operations in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing his final press conference in Nairobi after the April visit, Boutros-Ghali called on the world to take action to prevent crises rather than &quot;spending 10 times more&quot; to quell them after they had exploded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali acknowledged at a press conference at the end of a three-day conference of UN agency heads which discussed a new 25 billion dollar initiative to reverse Africa's marginalisation, that much of the criticism of the United Nations role in Rwanda's 1994 civil war had been justified. &quot;I agree with many of the criticisms,&quot; he said, but added that &quot;if member states are not ready to participate,&quot; then there was little the United Nations could do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN troops pulled out of the tiny central African country earlier this month despite continuing clashes there between Hutu guerrillas and the Tutsi-dominated army, and the presence in surrounding countries of 1.7 million Hutu refugees who fear they will face retaliation at the hands of the minority Tutsis if they return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Blue Helmets left after the Kigali government refused to agree to a renewal of their mandate, accusing them of doing nothing to halt the slaughter of more than 500,000 men, women and children during the war by Hutu extremists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations had not been able to obtain the mobilisation of the international community until after the genocide had taken place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worsening situation in the two countries prompted the United States government to announce on May 6 that it would despatch a team to Burundi and Rwanda to check out the alleged massacres in ethnic conflicts in the two neighbouring African countries, which have a similar ethnic mix -- about 80 per cent Hutus and 14 per cent Tutsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The department's top human rights envoy, John Shattuck, and the special coordinator for the two countries, Richard Begosian, were due to leave Washington late May 6 for the mission. Although Begosian has already arrived in the region, the visit by Shattuck has since been cancelled. The assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labour, was expected to visit Rwanda to assess the efforts by an international tribunal to prosecute those responsible for massacres in 1994 that claimed more than half a million Tutsi and Hutus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Burundi, he was expected to investigate an April 26 massacre of civilian Hutus near the village of Mtoye in the northern province of Gitega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said information available indicates that more than 230 people were killed and &quot;it appears that elements within the military or the Tutsi militia may have been responsible for this massacre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We certainly deplore the continuation of violence and the escalation of the violence in the last couple of weeks in Burundi,&quot; he said. &quot;We would call on all sides to abandon violence and to pursue a more peaceful expression of their political differences.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The latest carnage in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, was not entirely unexpected. If anyone, especially the Economic Community of West African states (ECOWAS) ECOMOG, thought the contrary, they were deluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many, particularly Liberians believe the present state of affairs in the West African country was prompted by the ill-advised and misguided policy the Economic Community of West African States adopted at the initial stages of its intervention in the Liberian conflict in 1990. To understand this, it is important to revisit the establishment of ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To begin with, there were two plans of action -- one concealed from other ECOWAS member states and successfully implemented within the overall programme, leading to the devastation of Liberia. The other was a publicly declared intention by ECOWAS to peacefully resolve the conflict, and regarded by many as a noble task and the first African solution to an African problem.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was former Nigerian military dictator Ibrahim Babangida, who floated the idea of a &quot;peacekeeping force&quot;, ostensibly to stop further bloodshed in Liberia. But in essence, it was a cover-up to avenge the loss of his joint business empire in Liberia with the late Liberia's military dictator, Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the business partnership between the two dictators, Babangida received more honours in Liberia than in his home country. The University of Liberia established the Babangida School of International Relations, of which Doe was the first student, and the highway between Sierra Leone and Liberia was named the Babangida Highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil war was launched by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) in 1989 as a popular uprising against one of the worst, disastrous misrules in Africa. Doe subsequently requested Babangida to intervene and end the rebellion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to be seen not to be directly involved, Babangida sought the formation of ECOMOG as a smoke-screen guided by the subtlety of &quot;regional stability.&quot; ECOMOG was hastily assembled in Freetown, Sierra Leone, following a similarly arranged ECOWAS leaders' meeting in Banjul, Gambia, which excluded the Taylor group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That meeting, chaired by then Gambian President, Sir Dawda Jawara, selected Dr. Amos Sawyer as interim president. ECOMOG was rejected out of hand by Taylor as a Nigerian ploy to save Doe. The express purpose of the intervention force, when it landed in Monrovia in August, 1990, was to separate the warring sides and make the Liberian capital a safe haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, however, ECOMOG not only fought alongside an NPFL splinter group led by Prince Johnson, the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), and the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), but it also declared total war against the mainstream NPFL, with both ground and air attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NPFL was eventually pushed out of Monrovia by the combined force, while the other armed groups were allowed to stay. It must also be noted that AFL had been transformed by Doe into a tribal army -- almost all key positions including army chief of staff were held by his Krahn tribesmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moreover, no sooner had ECOMOG arrived in Liberia than Babangida single-handedly removed the Ghanaian commander and replaced him with a Nigerian. Meanwhile, from its base in Sierra Leone, ECOMOG was busy organising the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO), mainly drawn from Krahn AFL refugees and immigrant Mandingo traders who supported Doe to protect their business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, the Nigerians also allegedly helped organise the Liberia Peace Council (LPC), headed by Doe's former Education Minister, George Boley, himself a Krahn. All these groups, except the NPFL, operated and issued their war statements from Monrovia. The capital became more and more militarised, instead of demilitarised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another significant aspect to remember is that throughout the war, the Krahn-dominated AFL has regarded the rest of the non-Krahn population as supporters of the NPFL. Little wonder, then, that the AFL carried out massacres of civilians such as the one in Harbel (Firestone Rubber Plantation) and that at the Paynesville Monrovia suburb, under the nose of ECOMOG, in areas controlled by the &quot;peacekeepers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bellicose between Nigeria and the NPFL continued until General Sani Abacha seized power, when Nigeria, which is the largest contributor to the ECOMOG force, softened its stand. This led to signing of the Abuja peace accord (August, 1995), described by many as the last chance to bring about lasting peace to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accord provides for the faction leaders to share power alongside civilians on the transitional state council until democratic elections are held in August this year. The costly blunder made by ECOMOG in taking sides, put it in a precarious position, hoping that the worst will not happen while the transitional government was still in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG was unable to drive the armed groups of its former allies from the city and take control of overall security. As a result, it was forced to also give NPFL free access to Monrovia, which is now home to more than a million displaced people from various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It, therefore, came as no surprise when fighting erupted on April 6, over attempts by the interim government to arrest deposed ULIMO-J leader, Roosevelt Johnson, on charges of murder. Johnson was ousted in March by senior commanders of his Krahn faction of ULIMO and subsequently dismissed by the interim government as Rural Development Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of Britain's leading dailies, The Independent, was more scathing in its attack on the US and Nigeria for their approach to the war and praised Taylor's policies in areas he controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The importance of Taylor's policies and the stability of his rule in Greater Liberia have only been recognised in retrospect. At the time, the US government, worried about Taylor's links with Libya, allied itself with the Nigerian component of ECOMOG and its attempts to weaken Taylor's control,&quot; says the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent goes on: &quot;Neither country was willing to let Taylor take over -- the Nigerians because the then President Babangida had been a close associate and relative of Doe. While diplomatic and aid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> officials in Liberia now discuss Taylor's charisma, his consistency and his economics degree, back then the talk was of the atrocities committed by his fighters, his cocaine habit and his megalomania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the British daily, ECOMOG is widely acknowledged to have conducted a covert campaign against Taylor during the ceasefire, through its support and funding of ULIMO, a new rebel army set up among Krahn and Mandingo refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If West African leaders, together with the international community, still intend to implement the Abuja accord and put the peace process in Liberia back on course, they must demand the withdrawal of all armed groups from Monrovia, including the so-called Armed Forces of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The AFL lost its status as a national army when Samuel Doe transformed it into an ethnic Krahn army, thereby making it one of the main instigators of the civil war. Representatives of the Council of State, including the warlords, must be allowed only a few bodyguards while overall security in the capital must be in the hands of ECOMOG and the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could not have been put more aptly by the White House in a statement condemning renewed fighting which broke the ceasefire that took effect on April 19. &quot;We urge all factions to restore the ceasefire immediately, withdraw their fighters and weapons from Monrovia, return the capital to its status as a safehaven for the city's one million inhabitants and negotiate a lasting peace in Liberia,&quot; said the White House statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement follows an upsurge of fighting after the Executive Mansion (State House) was attacked by fighters loyal to ULIMO-J leader Roosevelt Johnson on April 29, as council chairman, Wilton Sankawulo and main faction leader Charles Taylor were meeting there to reassure residents that security has returned to the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Taylor's foe, now ally, Alhaji Kromah of ULIMO-K, was also at the meeting but left earlier before the attack. Both men are vice- chairmen on the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports say Taylor and Sankawulo were forced to flee under a hail of gunfire. The mansion is close to the Barclay Training Centre (BTC) military barracks in the city centre, where Johnson's forces, backed by the AFL and George Bolay's Liberia Peace Council (LPC) have been holed up for the last one month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - Uganda used to be the &quot;Pearl of Africa&quot;. However more than 20 years of bad government since the sixties reduced a great country to its knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Current President Yoweri Museveni, the man who helped redress the country's negative image since he took over in 1986, won another five years in office, pledging &quot;to consolidate gains.&quot; Although it is generally accepted that the presidential polls last week were a measure of the people's appreciation of the incumbent's rule in the last 10 years, critical issues remain to be resolved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Museveni 52, used the advantages of his incumbency and his proven track in restoring the rule of law in Uganda to draw large crowds wherever his campaign trail has taken him, including Buganda, the home region of Dr.  Ssemogerere. More than 25 per cent of Uganda's 8.4 million voters are Baganda, Uganda's largest and (generally considered) most progressive ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was the first presidential poll in Uganda in 16 years. Dr.  Ssemogerere, a lack lustre former school teacher is reputed to have won the 1980 presidential poll, which was allegedly rigged for Milton Obote who returned for the second time in 1980. Obote first ruled Uganda from 1962 to 1971 when he was overthrown by Gen. Idi Amin. The 1980 presidential elections were declared valid by a Commonwealth observer team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ironically Ssemogerere has allied with the same Milton Obote this time around to try and remove Museveni from power. The alliance between Ssemogerere's Democratic Party (DP), and the Uganda People's Congress (UPC), of Milton Obote is called Inter Party Coalition (IPC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But millions of Baganda and members of other ethnic groups have little liking for Obote whom they blame for the atrocities which characterised his regimes from 1962 to 1971 and 1980 to 1985, the latter term which ended when he was overthrown by General Tito Okello, who was himself toppled by Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA), in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the eyes of the Baganda, Obote's biggest political mistake was the move to abolish the traditional kingdoms in Uganda in 1966. The King of the Baganda, Sir Frederick Mutesa II, fled his kingdom and died a pauper in London in 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thus while many Baganda would have supported Dr. Ssemogerere, his alliance with Obote has cost him substantial support among his own Baganda people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obote was also blamed for the atrocities in the Luwero Triangle area, near Kampala, where more than 300,000 people perished due to army atrocities during the war of liberation conducted by the NRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many northerners particularly Acholis have never forgiven Museveni for his guerrilla war against Obote and General Okello, both of them northerners.  There is currently an anti-Museveni insurgency in the north led by Joseph Kony, of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kony has perpetrated unbelievable crimes against his own Acholi people including rape, maiming by amputation of limbs or cutting off of lips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a campaign visit to the north of the country, Ssemogerere received overwhelming support from the Acholi when he said he would &quot;bring Kony to State House&quot; to negotiate with him and thus end the insurgency in Gulu and Kitgum Districts of northern Uganda. Women sang praises for Ssemogerere saying they were &quot;tired of war and being bitten by mosquitoes,&quot; a reference to the fact that they sleep outside their huts to avoid marauding Kony guerrillas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni, by contrast is looking for a military solution to the problem asserting &quot;Kony is a Sudanese supported criminal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another critical issue is federalisation which the Baganda call federo.  The federal status of the kingdoms in Uganda were abolished in 1966 when the monarchies themselves were violently uprooted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni has since the early 90s restored the kingdoms but the monarchs in the four traditional kingdoms of Uganda have only limited power and are viewed as cultural institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition, including Ssemogerere who is from the Baganda tribe, say the restoration of the kingdoms is superficial. They call it byoya bya nswa (&quot;termite wings&quot;) a derogatory term meaning &quot;useless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ssemogerere has therefore regularly campaigned on federo. He has promised the Baganda in particular, a full federal status. Unfortunately his party is allied with Obote who abolished the kingdoms in the first place (1966).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, many other tribes in Uganda consider Ssemogerere an unbridled tribalist ready to serve the interests of his home region without caring for the rest of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mayanja Kibirige, a former University Administrator has concentrated his electioneering on development issues as well as peace and security to explain what he would do should both Kony and Juma Oris of the West Nile Bank Front, another guerrilla force in north-western Uganda, turn down his peace overtures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni throughout his campaigns told the Baganda that Ssemogerere is a weakling who was &quot;merely a conduit for the return of Obote.&quot; He said he was alarmed by the fact that the issue of return of Obote was drawing large crowds into Museveni's rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had told the people of Lango District, Obote's home district, that he would return Obote (now in exile in Zambia) and offer him a fulfilling position as a retired Head of State. In Buganda, Ssemogerere changed tune entirely and said he had never made any such promises. Museveni described the grey-haired Ssemogerere as a &quot;trickster who will plunge the country back into the abyss.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During Museveni's last political rally in Kampala, Baganda women sang &quot;tewagala mirembe&quot; (we want peace) in appreciation of Museveni's restoration of peace and security for the majority of Ugandans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poverty has been a major factor in the electioneering. Mayanja and Ssemogerere say they would cut down expenditures on defence and use the money for health and education. Museveni agrees that an overwhelming majority of Ugandans live in abject poverty but blames past regimes for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argues that in the last 10 years of his rule he has improved the situation tremendously. &quot;I have brought in investors to &quot;milk&quot; so we may be able to pay for your children's education.&quot; His election manifesto claims the first four children in any family will receive free education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Museveni blames the opposition in Uganda for &quot;trying to reap where they did not sow.&quot; He says the economy is already on the mend. &quot;Ten years ago we managed only 44 million US dollars in taxation collection. Today we rake in nearly 700 million US dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the opposition say it is this kind of efficiency in the collection of taxes that is killing initiative in Ugandans. Ugandans are burdened by taxation, they claim.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NAIROBI - The Canadian Government has donated 300 metric tonnes of foodstuff for refugees residing in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foodstuff include 200 metric tonnes of soya bean oil and 100 tonnes of lentils (Canadian beans). News of the donation was contained in a press release dated May 8 from the Kenya Office of the World Food Programme (WFP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WFP Nairobi office said the food will benefit the estimated 175,000 refugees residing in Kenya, adding that a second ship is expected to deliver to WFP a further donation of Canadian food commodities for the same refugee programme on May 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WFP press release, the consignment which will arrive via the coastal port of Mombasa comprises some 134 metric tonnes of soya bean oil and 460 tonnes of lentils, bringing to 8,710 metric tonnes, the amount of foodstuff the Canadian Government has donated to WFP, Kenya Office since July 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The contribution, valued at Kshs.280 million (US dollars 4.9 million) includes the monitoring and logistics cost. A large part of this donation arrived in Kenya last November when the World Food Programme received a shipment of 6,210 tonnes of wheat flour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WFP also talks of another donation of 5,110 metric tonnes of wheat flour from the French Government, at the cost of Kshs.84 million (US dollars 1.47 million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A WFP official told APS the two donations will go a long way to boost the organisation's food capacity for thousands of refugees residing in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics availed to APS by both WFP and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) here, indicate that by March 31, 1996, Kenya had 126,162 Somali refugees, 43,647 Sudanese, 5,700 Ethiopian, 518 Ugandan, 220 Zairean, 52 Rwandese, 52 Burundian and nine from other nationalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP says the 175,000 refugees in Kenya reside in the seven refugee camps situated mainly in northern Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP constantly buys Kenyan maize from local suppliers to support the refugee operation. &quot;Currently 1,975 tonnes of maize, valued at Kshs.24 million (US dollars 421,000 ) are being purchased from the National Cereals and Produce Board in Garissa, using funds donated to WFP by the German Government. This brings the total of Kenyan maize purchased by WFP this year to 7,100 tonnes, worth Kshs.84 million,&quot; the press release stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The European Community has provided a large part of the funds to support WFP's local procurement efforts which began in July 1995 and end in December 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA - Days before Ugandans went to polls to elect their president, women organisations in the country issued a no- nonsense &quot;women's manifesto&quot; for the attention of candidates and voters especially women voters, during and after elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unless the presidential candidates identify themselves with our manifesto, they can be sure they are not going to get women's votes,&quot; the Chairperson of the Uganda Women's Network (UWONET), Mrs Mande Mugisha, said in an interview here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As voters, women would like to see that issues of interest and concern to Ugandan women are addressed by those aspiring to be leaders of this country through the presidential, parliamentary and local council elections,&quot; Mrs. Mugisha said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda Women's Network organised a meeting on April 25, 1996, to put women's issues on the election agenda. Apart from providing a forum to a cross section of women and men to discuss issues of concern to the women of Uganda in particular during the elections, the meeting adopted a &quot;women's manifesto&quot; highlighting issues that women and men working for gender equality in society consider important for the attention of both candidates and voters particularly women voters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 11-page, seven-point manifesto highlights the following issues: Peace, stability and unity in diversity; gender balance, equality and affirmative actions; poverty and economic empowerment of women; violence against women; protection of the rights of the family, orphans, children with special needs and the aged; people with disabilities; and women and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other points, the manifesto states that peace is a pre- requisite for the attainment of equality between women and men. Although women rarely have any role in the decisions leading to armed conflicts, they work to preserve social order in the midst of conflicts. They also make an important contribution as peace educators and resolvers of conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a nation, collective responsibility must be taken for the past mistakes in order to create peace and stability,&quot; the women emphasize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Expounding on gender balance, equality and affirmative action, the women demand that there must be at least 30 per cent representation of women at all levels of decision making. This must include local councils, cabinet and all commissions and boards. Special effort must be made to encourage and support women to stand as candidates in all elections at all levels. Marriage and motherhood must not be used to disqualify candidacy of an individual, they add.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidential candidates and voters are urged to regard women as producers of wealth and not as objects of welfare. The manifesto advocates for women participation in all economic decision-making activities and calls for at least a 50 per cent share by women of the government-instituted national rural credit scheme locally known as &quot;Entandikwa&quot; - initial capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On violence against women, the manifesto says in all societies, to a greater or lesser degree, women and girls are subject to physical, sexual and psychological abuse that cuts across lines of income, class and culture, in both public and private life. They often face rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at the workplace. Such acts of violence violate and impair or nullify women's enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Uganda women therefore demand that their rights must be seen to be human rights and their lives and rights must be protected accordingly. In particular, when women suffer violence, the information they give should be treated with sensitivity, dignity, concern and confidentiality by those in authority. The women also demand the immediate reestablishment of special laws and family courts to deal with domestic violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manifesto further points out that whereas the constitution guarantees the rights of the family based on marriage, other forms of families such as single-headed families and child-headed families need to be recognised and protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, the manifesto highlights the issue of women and health. It states women's health involves their emotional, social and physical well being. It is determined by the social, political and economic context of their lives, as well as by biology. The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is vital for the life and well-being of women.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LONDON - As African countries vie with each other to produce more gold and other minerals, the human cost resulting from mining is becoming high as accidents coupled with environmental degradation cloud proceeds that this industry brings to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has described mining as &quot;one of the world's most hazardous sectors, causing more than 15,000 deaths a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is the continent's biggest producer of gold and according to Pik Botha, the country's Minister for Mineral and Energy Affairs, &quot;each tonne of gold mined in the country costs one life and 12 serious injuries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Guinean researching on the lifestyle of African miners says; &quot;Most African miners are condemned to high noise levels, heat and other harms that would not be tolerated in other parts of the world.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sully Cisse, a mining engineer notes in the findings that unlike miners in other parts of the world, African miners do not have protective gears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The uncontrolled small scale miners have to &quot;contend with dangerous working conditions. For those underground, frequent rockfalls, mudslides, fires from overturned lamps, poor ventilation, dust and smoke concentrations are among risks,&quot; according to a recent report by the UK-based PANOS institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, it has become widely accepted that small-scale mining &quot;destroys vegetation as hillsides are cleared when miners follow a vein of gold. Forest is also felled to make way for airstrips and working areas,&quot; adds Panos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report cites effects of mining in other parts of the world and says &quot;medium scale operators use great suction pumps set on floating barges which undermine river banks, creating huge waste piles which alter the flow and currents. This can drastically change the landscape, often endangering villages on the banks, and causes excessive situation which can reduce the efficiency of hydroelectric projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the case of large scale mining, the report says &quot;in the process of mining billions of tonnes of ore, whole mountainsides can be gouged out, leading to the severe loss of topsoil, habitat, trees and vegetation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, with hunger and poverty staring majority of Africans in the face, the gory effects of mining are bound to be ignored for short term benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some politicians say with some justification that the continent's crisis could be likened to facing the deep blue sea or the devil. The devil being the mining activities and the deep blue sea, staying put waiting for God.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As discussions on the environmental effect of mining continue Alan Burt, a London-based environmentalist says the situation is becoming very serious as it is no longer the environment alone that is being destroyed but small scale miners are poisoning themselves with the use of mercury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process of extracting minerals with mercury has become widespread all over Africa and health workers say the trend has increased so much so that the alarm has to be sounded to warn people of the dangers involved in using this chemical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a UK magazine Ecologist, &quot;people exposed to mercury for an average of 30 months, or who lived within 500 metres of a source of mercury, show some clinical symptoms of poisoning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mercury enters the body through inhalation, ingestion and skin absorption. Much of it is passed out in urine, but high exposure can result in the metal being deposited in the central nervous system. Chronic poisoning can lead to insomnia, severe tremors, brain damage, and even death. By entering the placenta, it can cause birth defects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chemical does not only poison those who use it, water used in the production process carries mercury into river-systems and as unregulated mining increases it is not clear how much mercury is being washed into African river systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To fight the phenomenon, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has recommended the prohibition of mercury and suggested that alternative gravity-based technologies should be used. This is however not likely to be accepted among Africa's small scale miners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNEP officials say retorts, which eliminate mercury gas given off during the burning process and burn just as quickly can now be made easily. Gold diggers can also use sponge filters which can be attached to furnaces to reduce the risk that they are open to when they use mercury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The miners can also use sluice gates and traps to help prevent mercury from spilling into river-systems and other processes that can cleanse and recycle mercury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BLANTYRE - Malawian President Bakili Muluzi reshuffled his cabinet on May 2 after coalition partner Chakufwa Chihana tendered his resignation as Vice-President and Minister for Irrigation and Water Development, throwing the ruling circles into uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chihana, leader of the Alliance for Democracy (AFORD), who agreed on the coalition pact last year with Muluzi's ruling United Democratic Front (UDF), resigned the same day saying that he would devote more of his time to his party work, a statement issued by his aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement said his decision was endorsed on May 1 by AFORD's executive committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprisingly, Muluzi did not drop any AFORD ministers in the reshuffle, but instead dismissed Health Minister Sam Mpasu whom he gave the post of secretary general of the UDF, which was held by Harry Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mpasu was involved in a corruption scandal when he was Education Minister and there were opposition demands that he must resign to make room for an official investigation into his role of ordering, at an expensive rate, about four million notebooks from a British supplier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Relations between the two coalition partners started to cool in December when Chihana accused the UDF of lacking transparency, good governance and engaging in high-level corruption and threatened to pull out of the coalition. The coalition sought to consolidate democratic gains and bind the two parties to a coordinated working relationship in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muluzi has denied the allegations of corruption saying there was no proof of such practices. But Chihana's resignation took a dramatic turn on May 7 when AFORD's secretary-general Mapopa Chipeta, a right-hand man of Chihana, criticised him, saying he did not discuss his decision to step down with other AFORD national executive members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chihana has personal political ambitions and should not force others to side with him,&quot; Chipeta was quoted by the local media as saying on May 7.  AFORD will meet on June 2 to review the coalition accord hammered out last year with the ruling (UDF) of President Bakili Muluzi. Under the accord, Muluzi appointed five ministers from AFORD and sent two senior AFORD leaders into diplomatic postings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The June 2 meeting will specifically &quot;discuss the stand of those who are still in government&quot; - a topic which will generate heated debate among the five ministers and most AFORD supporters. Key leaders want the party to abrogate the coalition, formed to consolidate democracy and bind the two parties to a coordinated working relationship in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chipata, a likely candidate to succeed Chihana as second vice- president said: &quot;Chihana should have remained in the government to help solve the country's problems for the benefit of suffering Malawians,&quot; pointing out: &quot;If you are a leader you face both good and bad things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chihana, who only makes public rallies in his stronghold of the northern region, told supporters on May 3 in Mzuzu that he resigned because: &quot;I felt I had let the people down since their aspirations were not realised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The lives of the majority of the people are deteriorating everyday, while only a few people in powerful positions are enjoying the sweat. We should not play jokes or cards with the lives of Malawians,&quot; Chihana had stressed in his resignation announcement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAPE TOWN - The South African parliament overwhelmingly adopted the country's landmark constitution on May 8, the first to be drafted by a multi-racial parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill, the result of two years of hard bargaining between the country's widely divided parties, needed a two-thirds majority in the 490-strong Constitutional Assembly comprised of all members of the two houses of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It obtained 421 votes in favour, two against and 10 abstentions -- but the vote had to be taken twice when some members hit the wrong buttons on the electronic voting system to give a first, erroneous result of 420 for, two against and one abstention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the first vote, legislators chanting &quot;ANC&quot;, broke into a popular liberation song that translates as &quot;bring me my machine gun,&quot; and danced around their benches -- only to be called to order for the second, decisive round of polling.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That the constitution would obtain the required two-thirds was given after agreements reached late on May 7 by the country's two biggest parties, Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) and deputy president Frederick de Klerk's National Party (NP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two agreed on compromise wordings shortly before midnight on clauses dealing with lockouts, property rights and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;South Africa today undergoes her rebirth, cleansed of a horrible past, matured from a tentative beginning and reaching out to the future with confidence,&quot; President Nelson Mandela declared after the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The nation teetered on a knife edge over the past few days, with reports of intractable deadlocks and an abyss in waiting,&quot; Mandela said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But aren't South Africans a wonderful people, to whom the words 'deadlock' and 'miracle' have come to nestle in comfortable proximity,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The liberal Democratic Party and the black nationalist Pan Africanist Congress voted for the new constitution, while the white right-wing Freedom Front abstained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The votes against were from the two representatives of the South African Christian Democratic Party, which deems the new basic law ungodly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zulu nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party was absent from the proceedings, having pulled out of the constitution-writing process in February 1995, accusing the ANC of reneging on a pre-electoral promise of international mediation on provincial rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela called on blacks and whites to stop thinking of themselves as separate entities and only as South Africans who, he said, played a major role in drafting the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the final analysis,&quot; he said, the praise we are apt to heap upon ourselves appears misplaced against the backdrop of the active participation of the people,&quot; and vowed that with the new constitution, &quot;Never and never again shall the laws of our land rend our people apart or legalise their oppression and repression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the vote, an emotional Constitutional Assembly Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa called the event &quot;the birthday of the South African rainbow nation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the tough but successful constitution writing process would be an inspiration to the entire African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This thing that we have done today, in this small corner of a great continent that has contributed so decisively to the evolution of humanity, says that Africa reaffirms she is continuing to rise from the ashes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk was more circumspect, only saying: &quot;It is not a perfect constitution. But it is a reasonable starting point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa, who will leave parliament for the private sector once the basic law gets the final green light from the Constitutional Court, could barely check his emotions as he thanked his colleagues, with particular emphasis on NP secretary-general Roelf Meyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two men are widely credited with being the architects of South Africa's peaceful transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a long and difficult period of negotiation lasting from Mandela's 1990 release from prison to the final concessions hammered out late May 7, Ramaphosa, a poor black policeman's son who became a union leader, and Meyer, the attorney scion of a wealthy white farming family, became close friends and, for many, symbols of the new, post-apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALGERIA - Eighteen people, all but two of them Islamic extremists, were killed when Algerian security forces launched an assault overnight on a building where armed Islamic rebels were holed up with hostages, Algerian radio reported on May 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The radio said a policeman and a civilian had died in the dawn assault, while witnesses earlier said several people suffering from shock had been taken to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The drama began overnight on May 5 when police attempted to raid an apartment building in Birmandreis, a southern suburb of Algiers, where the extremists were holed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three or four of the Islamic rebels and at least one police officer were killed during the initial assault after which police surrounded the building and sealed off the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extremists responded with a hail of gunfire and took families living in the building hostage. Security forces evacuated other families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 7, press reports said the leader of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), Djamel Zitouni, was among the extremists along with Said Omar, believed responsible for several spectacular attacks in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GIA is considered the most radical of Algeria's Islamic fundamentalist armed groups vying to topple the secular government since January 1992, when the military-backed regime annulled elections that an Islamic party was poised to win, and which has killed tens of thousands of people since.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident came only days after Algerian President Liamine Zeroual announced that legislative elections would be held by June 1997 and would be followed by local polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeroual on May 5 told a meeting of media executives -- his first since his election last November -- that the elections would be preceded by a mid-year national conference grouping &quot;all the forces of the nation&quot; and by a referendum on amending the constitution, the official news agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> State radio said the referendum would be held before the end of the year. Zeroual made the announcement following the first phase of discussions held last month with various political leaders and parties, excluding the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FSI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeroual was elected last November 16 with 61.01 per cent of the vote in the first multi-party presidential ballot in Algeria's history. Voter participation in the presidential poll was 75 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The poll was boycotted by the National Liberation Front, formerly Algeria's sole political party, and the Socialist Forces Front, which was then allied with the FIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two parties, however, took part last month in discussions concerning the planned legislative elections and the talks are due to resume by the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Absent from the discussions was the FIS, which began its campaign to topple the secular government after the army intervened in January 1992 to cancel the second round of elections which the now- banned FIS was poised to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeroual was quoted by the Algerian Press Service as saying that the preliminary discussions held in April &quot;took place in a serene and realistic environment thus, leading us to hope of widespread participation by the political establishment in the next elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agency also said that the national conference preceding the elections would &quot;debate the major issues and the protection of the multi-party system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zeroual's press conference on May 5 took place against a backdrop of violence in recent days in which a former Interior Minister and two other people were killed in two separate incidents by suspected fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former minister, Mohamed Hardi, was killed on May 4 by three armed gunmen in the car park of a state-owned firm, security officials said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was the second former Interior Minister to be killed, after Babou Kabkr Belakid was killed last year in downtown Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Minister between 1992 and 93, Hardi had taken a hardline stance against the FIS after a wave of attacks on Algerian intellectuals. Private newspapers also reported on May 5 that two people were killed and 15 injured when a homemade bomb exploded at a bus stop in Tizi-Ouzou, the main town in the Kabylie region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The blast and Hardi's murder come amid a wave of unpublicized attacks in Algeria, as the government seeks to deprive Islamic fundamentalists of publicity in the latest phase of the four-year civil war which has claimed the lives of nearly 50,000 people, mostly civilians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - A number of organizations have voiced disapproval after delegates meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, from April 22 to May 3 adopted new rules on the use of landmines but ignored demands for an outright ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An inter-governmental conference revising the landmines protocol of the 1980 UN Conventional Weapons Convention agreed to outlaw undetectable antipersonnel mines, also known as &quot;dumb mines&quot;, and put tighter restrictions on self-destructing mines also known as &quot;smarter&quot; mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a press release, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Vice-President, Eric Roethlisberger, said the amended landmine protocol was &quot;woefully inadequate.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the close of the two-week conference, the Vice- President said that &quot;the Landmines Committee of the Red Cross (LCRC) considers as woefully inadequate the initial legal response to the increasingly devastating effects of mines as represented by the results of the Review Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The horror of the immense human suffering caused by landmines is set to continue, and (this amendment) will do little to change this situation,&quot; Roethlisberger warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Geneva meeting, which brought together delegates from 65 governments and scores of non-governmental and religious organizations agreed, on among other issues; the prohibition of the use of all undetectable anti-personnel (AP) landmines; that &quot;remotely delivered&quot; AP mines must be designed to self-destruct within 30 days with 90 per cent reliability that the party that lays the mines will be responsible for clearing them, and that the protocol's rules apply to both internal and international conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the protocol prohibited the export and import of outlawed undetectable mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However these measures did not impress a big number of Non- Governmental Organisations and religious groups who came together in 1991 and founded the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ICBL is a worldwide coalition of more than 450 non-governmental agencies and religious organizations which has been lobbying for a total ban on landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the total ban also anticipated by more than 30 governments as well as the United Nations and the International Red Cross, will not have to wait for at least five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Secretary General Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali was one of the leaders who voiced disapproval of the Geneva meeting's outcome. &quot;I must register my deep disappointment that the progress achieved falls so far short of what I had hoped for at this review conference,&quot; Dr. Boutros-Ghali is reported to have said in a statement read to the conference on his behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The next review conference of the convention will take place in five year's time,&quot; he added. &quot;Our estimate is that by the year 2001 an additional 50,000 human beings will have been killed and a further 80,000 injured by landmines,&quot; he concluded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the more than 100 million landmines deployed all over the world, 30 million are believed to have been planted across at least 18 African countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia is among the three nations in the Southern African region expecting a good grain harvest this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior economist at Southern African Development Community's (SADC) early warning unit, Phumzile Mdladla, disclosed in an interview yesterday that among the eleven country's of the Southern African region, only three countries would record good harvests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite the good rains this season most countries are anticipating deficits in their grain harvest except for only three countries namely Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe which expect to record surpluses,&quot; Mdladla said in an interview at the on-going grain marketing workshop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdladla, however, assured that the surpluses in these three countries would adequately cover the deficiencies that will be experienced by the other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; A total surplus of 3.14 million tonnes will be recorded against the collective deficit of 1.29 million tonnes of white maize,&quot; Mdladla said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to information from the regional centre, South Africa expects the largest harvest with a surplus of 2.950 million tonnes followed by 255,000 tonnes by Zambia and lastly Zimbabwe's 207,000 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Zimbabwe, it is not known if the surplus would be open for exports as its policy is to have a total of over 900,000 tonnes in its strategic reserves, making the anticipated surplus far below the required grain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdladla disclosed that despite receiving good rains, Malawi had recorded a deficit following high costs of fertiliser and farming inputs which most of its farmers found difficult to acquire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And representing the private trade sector, Grain Growers and Marketing Association chairman, George Lloyd attributed the anticipated 'bumper' harvest to good rains and increased planting by farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Cargil South Africa has shown interest in sourcing maize from Zambia .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on Zambia's harvest in relation to the Larger Grain Borer invasion, managing director of Cargil South Africa Limited, Thad Goff, felt this would have little impact on his company's intentions to source grain from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are aware of the LGB but we feel that this will not have any problem with our intentions to source maize grain from Zambia,&quot; he said. &quot; We have better contacts with the international markets and we'll look for the best market for Zambia's maize.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia, which in 1964 was rated the world's third major copper producing country and is currently in tenth position, will drop to thirteenth position, a ZCCM official disclosed in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) one week workshop for journalists which started in Lusaka yesterday, corporate affairs director, Pius Maambo, said the lack of investment since 1973 has led to decreased copper production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maambo said the only hope for the revitalisation of the country's mining industry lay in the on-going privatisation, especially the Konkola Deep Mining Project.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maambo said ZCCM is waiting for Anglo American, the largest of the company's B' shareholders, to announce the consortium of investors who will undertake the Konkola Deep Mining Project at a cost of $650 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anglo American Southern Africa executive, Jack Holmes, said last month that Anglo will be announcing the consortium by the end of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The company needs a further $2 billion to develop other projects which were dropped in 1993 when the copper price on the world market plunged to an all time low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prices fell from just over one dollar per pound of copper to 72 cents , tightening the company's cash flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time there was a temporary gain in the value of the Kwacha which also contributed to low production as it caused the ZCCM earnings to be drastically reduced. The company lost about $90 million in 1993 when the Kwacha gained from K551 to the dollar to K344.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To cover the company's loss, production expenses were kept as low as possible. Most capital projects were suspended while employees' fringe benefits had to be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This affected the workers' morale and has been another factor to the low production figures,&quot; Maambo observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, Zambia produces about 300,000 tonnes of copper annually compared to 500,000 ten years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the country can only expect revenue from Konkola in about eight years time, Maambo said it is better to invest in the future than wait and create the current depressing situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also urged that Zambia invests in other sectors of the economy to lessen the country's dependence on the copper production industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chile, the world's largest copper producer, produces 1.6 million tonnes of copper annually and copper contributes 48 per cent to Chile's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Meanwhile, Zambia's 300,000 tonnes contribute 95 per cent to the country's GDP,&quot; he observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maambo called for urgent utilisation of Zambia's agricultural and tourism potential.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - World Health Organisation (WHO) Representative to Zambia Dr.Wilfred Boayue has attributted the declining living standards in the African Region to the poor performance of the economies in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking when he opened a training workshop on 'Participatory Hygiene Promotion for Control of Diarrhoeal Diseases' at Pan African Institute for Development in Kabwe today, Dr. Boayue said the extreme degree of poverty in the region had resulted into overcrowding of cities, unhealthy water supply, manultrition and the spread of diseases among other health hazzards.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that diarrhoeal diseases were among the major causes of morbidity and mortality especially in children and urged the participants to come up with workable plan for solving the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'You have the opportunity to learn how to empower the people to analyse their problems and find practical solutions. This is the central theme that should not escape you during this workshop,' Dr. Boayue said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged the participants to exercise patience and strength so as to allow the community to participate with them in diagonising it's health problems and sorting out appropriate solutions and said that their efforts would be meaningless if this was not done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'If the community has ownership of the initiative, it will survive long after we have gone. If on the other hand, it is seen as being driven from the outside, it will disappear as soon as the outside hand is withdrawn,' Dr.  Boayue said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill continued in Parliament today with a nominated Member of Parliament asking the House to clearly define who was an indigenous Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contributing to the debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill of 1996 Environment Minister, William Harrington, said that he was not comfortable with a clause in the Constitution that says a person intending to stand as President should be an indigenious zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Harrington said unless the clause on the citizenship was re-defined, the majority of Zambians will not qualify to stand as presidents because most tribes in Zambia only migrated from other countries in the year 1500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said only the Ila and Tonga's are indigenous Zambians because they were already in the country even before other tribes started coming in.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister wondered whether the clause meant that only Ila's and Tonga's will qualify to stand as presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Raising a point of order Solwezi West Member of Parliament, Mr Kuliye Kafupi wondered how Mr Harrington could debate the citizenship of a president when he had not mentioned where coloureds migrated from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speaker ignored the point of order and made no ruling but Mr Harrington caused laughter when he said coloureds came as a result of the warm and cardinal relationship that exist between Africa and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Harrington in conclusion appealed to the opposition UNIP to came back and contribute to the on-going debate saying it was not too late for them to come back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP walked out of the House for the third time today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal Affairs Minister, Dr Remmy Mushota, today told the House that a national referendum would only be necessary if part three (3) and article 79 of the constitution were to be amemded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contributing to the on going Constitutional Amendment Bill debate he said under Article 62 and Section (1) of Article 79, it was only parliament which had the sole power to amend or include some provisions on the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mushota argued that government was merely introducing clause 34 on the presidential aspirant citizenship and 65 on the bill of chiefs, an Act he said did not require a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said calls to go for a Constituent Assembly in law was a vacuum and proposing for an establishment of a law to enable it happen was unpractical because the methodology to effect constitutional reforms were already vested in parliament by article 62 and 79 (1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mushota meanwhile, said that government would not accept to go to meetings where nationals could not respect their own republican president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He expressed disappointment at what the opposition did to the President at the recent inter-party meeting, saying even in the traditional Zambian set-up such a thing could not be allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Science, Technology and Vocational Training Minister, Dr Kabunda Kayongo, urged all Women Lobby Groups to lobby government to consider introducing a quota system for women so that gender aspects could be included in government policies if equal power sharing could be realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contributing to the debate on the Constitutional Amendment Bill, Dr Kayongo observed that presently not many women were making headway in politics and other spheres of national life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Deputy Minister in the office of the president, Eric Silwamba, urged UNIP to go back for debate because it was not yet too late for them to forward their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said in 1991 the MMD did not find it too late to negotiate with the then ruling UNIP even when the bill was already in second reading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy Minister, Kangwa Nsuluka, proposed in parliament that the minimun period of attaining Zambian citizenship be extended to 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Nsuluka said the current minimun of ten (10) years has made it very easy for foreigners to claim citizenship because it was very simplified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Nsuluka said the increase in the number of foreigners in the country has contributed to the upswing of problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Chimbamilonga Member of Parliament, Mr Samuel Mukupa proposed that to deter foreigners from penetrating into leadership, a presidential aspirant should submit 600 supporters from each province who are of Zambian origin. He further proposed that for a parliamentarian to show proof of his support, he should submit not less than 50 indeginious Zambian supporters and not the current requirement of only nine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gwembe Member of Parliament, Mr Jacob Kantina urged the House not to make the same mistake the British Government did of giving Zambia to Dr Kenneth Kaunda (a Nyansalander).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With this Constitution we have bought a net that will catch big fish&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Livingstone - Elephants are on the rampage destroying crops in Mulobezi, in Sesheke district and concerned villagers have appealed to the department of wildlife to correct the situation before all crops for this year are devoured by the hungry beasts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Machele Ward Councillor in Mulobezi, George Kalaluka, said in Livingstone today that so far three fields have been devoured by the rampaging elephants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have on several occasions reported their presence to Mulanga and Mulobezi wildlife camps but no corrective action had been taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''Elephants are destroying crops for the villagers in Mulobezi and in Machele ward three fields have been destroyed but wildlife say they are under instructions not to kill any elephant,'' Mr Kalaluka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said last year five fields of maize and sorghum and millet were destroyed but nothing was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The villagers, Mr Kalaluka, said were now demanding that government sets up a compensation fund from which villagers could be compensated from should their crops get destroyed by wildlife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said in the past elephants used to be killed and meat given to villagers whose crops were destroyed to exchange for grain with other people.  This, he said, saved families, unlike now when families were left to the mercy of the animals without due recourse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Kalaluka has expressed fears that if the elephants are not warded off, Mulobezi would face another year of hunger this year. He said the villagers had been expecting good food crops this year had it not been for the destruction by elephants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - University of Zambia Students Union (UNZASU) vice-president Joseph Munsanje has dismissed allegations by a pro-ruling MMD student group that his executive has been bought by the opposition to incite confusion at campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The story of money is very new to us in the union ,&quot; Munsanje said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is only a disillusioned group which is trying to fabricate such malicious information against the union leadership. &quot;Our position is that we would like to deliver a point that the government should withdraw the bill and a general consensus be set to iron-out contentious issues in the constitution bill.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A pro-MMD student group, calling itself UNZA-Pressure Group, issued a statement to the government owned and controlled media that some union officials have been given K1.5 million by opposition UNIP to incite students to fan confusions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government had extended the re-openning of the agriculture college for the second time after the institution failed to open as per academic calender early this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the minutes obtained by students from the Ministry of Agriculture, under the which institution falls, K112 million was needed for the re-openning of the college.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have been informed that K112m was needed if the institution was to re-open, but if it is a serious government let it fund the institution the soonest possible time instead of funding campaign exercise,&quot; Mbalazi demanded. &quot; The government was also aware of our academic calendar and it should claim to run short of funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Anti-trade union forces in the country are growing and are posing a serious challenge to the survival of the labour movement, warned ZCTU secretary general Alec Chirwa in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chirwa made the warning at the opening of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) tripartite workshop on trade union integration at Lusaka's Andrews Motel yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The challenge is that of uniting the trade union movements as one solid force,&quot; Chirwa said. &quot;All what this is requires is that trade unions begin making strategies that will address the difficulties now at hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chirwa said the fragmentation of the trade union movement was not a strange development given the current socio-economic and political environment. &quot;There is unknown fear among certain circles that makes a strong, united and independent union not desirable,&quot; Chirwa said. &quot; As such there is a lot of pressure to fragment the trade union movement so that it is weakened.&quot; Speaking at the same workshop labour minister Newstead Zimba said the government was aware of the developments that were taking place in the labour movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am informed that this high level workshop will tackle themes related to the weaknesses and disintegration of the labour movement and map out possible ways to re-invigorate the labour movement in Zambia,&quot; Zimba said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela surprised the country by swiftly replacing the National Party cabinet ministers, cutting down the size of the cabinet from 27 to 25, and bringing back Pallo Jordan, fired from the cabinet only a month ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the ministers who received promotions are former deputy ministers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ministers are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Pallo Jordan, returned as minister of environmental affairs and tourism. Speculation is that the outcry that followed Jordan's sacking caused Mandela to look more favourably upon reinstating him, although to a more junior position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Valli Moosa, minister of provincial affairs and constitutional development (he was previously deputy minister in the same department).  Moosa, once a leading figure in the United Democratic Front, played a key role in the negotations that led up to the April 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Land Affairs minister Derek Hanekom now takes over agriculture as well. With his well-publicised sympathies for the landless, Hanekom may find himself facing strong antagonism from established farming interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Deputy Minister of home affairs Pennuel Maduna moves to Mineral and Energy Affairs. Although he has no experience in this key portfolio, he has won a reputation for competence. He was one of the ANC's first &quot;peace negotiators&quot; with the De Klerk government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> # Geraldine Fraser Moleketsi becomes minister of welfare and population development (she was previously the deputy minister). Only 36 years old, she is a former personal assistant to Joe Slovo and Chris Hani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The smaller cabinet means that Mandela is not obliged to give an extra seat to Inkatha. The new cabinet takes office on July 1.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The following declaration was issued by the conference of African Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) meeting in Midrand, South Africa from 24-28 April 1996, prior to the latest United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD IX).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> INTRODUCTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This declaration emerges from the discussions amongst African NGOs, labour, religious and other civil society organisations who came together in a parallel conference prior to UNCTAD IX. With the participation of similar organisations from other countries we exchanged experiences and ideas around issues of trade and development, and voiced our concerns about the impact of the global economic system upon our communities and countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We share a common vision of a world which recognises its essential interdependence while embracing human diversity in all its forms; where justice and equity for all peoples is the first priority, and in which principles of democracy and popular participation are universally upheld so that the creation of a peaceful, cooperative and sustainable future is secured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current system of globalisation and liberalisation has had devastating effects upon African economies. Our countries have been pushed backwards into increasing debt, de-industrialisation, agricultural decline, environmental degradation, poverty and deepening inequality. Those worse affected, such as children, youth and women, are already at the margins of society. Financial and physical resources continue to be drained out of Africa. Its marginalisation is both a product of an inequitable international system and of factors internal to African economies and polities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We oppose a system which places growth above all other goals, including human well-being, and which undermines national economic development and social security. We see that this system creates incentives for capital to externalise its social and environmental costs. It over-exploits and destroys the natural environment and encourages the unsustainable use of resources. It turns social services into commodities out of reach of the poor, generates jobless growth, derogates the rights of workers and undermines trade union and other democratic rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This global system has resulted in an ever greater concentration of power and control over resources into the hands of a relatively few transnational corporations and financial institutions. This process has exacerbated inequalities within and between countries, actively encouraged competition for investment and financial resources, and discouraged regional cooperation and integration amongst African countries. However, we affirm that globalisation and liberalisation are not irresistible processes but are the product of human agencies and can therefore be influenced and changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With respect to UNCTAD itself, we are concerned that it has largely taken on board the 'realities' of the liberalising globalised world order, although it does adopt a more holistic and questioning approach and raises issues of particular concern to the developing world. We are concerned at the relative inaccessibility of UNCTAD to the voices of non-governmental organisations and social movement representatives. Nonetheless, we believe that UNCTAD can play a useful role as a monitoring, research and policy development organisation and as a capacity building and technical support institution to governments and non-governmental forces in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In coming together prior to UNCTAD IX we have reached the following conclusions:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. GLOBALISATION AND LIBERALISATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We see that it is the strategies of business organisations and the interventions of financial institutions and governments that have produced the inter-linked processes of globalisation and liberalisation. Globalisation requires - and is reinforced by - the liberalisation or 'deregulation' of investment and capital movements, trade in goods and services, communications and other national and international economic transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African countries have for many years already been subject to such liberalisation processes through the imposition of structural adjustment programmes (SAPs). The neo-liberal economic paradigm makes our governments unresponsive to our basic economic and social needs, forces open our economies to the advantage of external traders and investors and makes African countries ever more dependent upon the richer industrialised countries and their transnational corporations. Our countries are being recolonised, and the responsibility of our governments to us is being replaced by their responsiveness to the needs and interests of TNCs and their home governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context we make the following key recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.1 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must heed the calls from their non-governmental organisations and social movements to resist the imposition of SAPs and other liberalisation programmes. These are damaging to people and economies and to governments' own policy independence and relevance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.2 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must be transparent in their dealings with the Bretton Woods Institutions and other external agencies and, by providing full information and resources to their own people, enable us to be more effective players and active partners in the struggles against liberalisation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.3 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must take responsibility for their own actions and not use the pretext of their obligations to external agencies and international forces as excuses for their own faults and t heir failures to respond to the democratic demands and development needs of their own people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.4 UNCTAD as a research and capacity building organisation focused particularly upon the needs of less/least developed countries must support the right, and provide the technical and policy backup f or governmental and non-governmental organisations and social movements in Africa, to pursue development programmes that are relevant to their visions and needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.5 UNCTAD must resist the global hegemony of the neo-liberal paradigm and legitimise the creation of development policies based upon national and local diversities and democratic rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 FINANCIAL FLOWS AND INVESTMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attraction of foreign investment through the creation of 'conducive conditions' are presumed - including by UNCTAD - to be the essential pre-condition for economic development worldwide. However, as African countries are encouraged to compete with each other for such foreign investment they aggravate their divisions and their dependence upon, and exploitation by, profit-seeking foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our experience of foreign investment in Africa is that it is minuscule in scale, concentrated in the extractive sectors, and while it has limited positive linkages into our economies it has many negative economic, social and environmental effects. The purported necessity to attract foreign investment is utilised by financial institutions and foreign governments as an instrument to impose their policies upon our governments. In the same way debt obligations are deliberately maintained by creditors - particularly the Bretton Woods Institutions - on account of the policy leverage it gives them over governments and countries under debt management programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context we make the following key recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.1 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must resist such dependence upon foreign investment by mobilising all possible internal financial sources and development resources, including community, cooperative, and national public and private enterprise. Furthermore, governments must play direct social and economic development roles on more democratic, participatory and accountable bases than hitherto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.2 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS should have recourse to Official Development Assistance (ODA) while they work towards mobilising alternative resources.  Such ODA should be allocated through transparent consultative processes and utilised in appropriate and accountable ways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.3 AFRICAN COUNTRIES must insist on the cancellation of external debts that cannot be repaid in order to enable the mobilisation of internal resources for investment. Any further external borrowing must be subject to clearly defined development aims and transparent democratic consultations and controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.4 UNCTAD should conduct objective analyses of, and monitor, the operations of transnational corporations (TNCs) around the world, especially their effects on local communities, national economies and the environment.  The UNCTAD investment division should operate within the perspective of the former UNCTC, instead of seeing its role as servicing the interests of TNCs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.5 UNCTAD should continue its work on monitoring the nature and effects of the astronomical and volatile speculative international financial flows promoted by financial deregulation and liberalisation. It should produce effective proposals for regulatory controls upon such dangerous financial forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3 TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT ISSUES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new multilateral rules-based trade regime that emerged out of the Uruguay Round of GATT has removed theoretically the unilateralist threats and pressures by strong countries that have long featured in international trade relations. However, neither it its creation, nor in its content and application is the new world trade regime, under the World Trade Organisation (WTO), an equitable or impartial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNCTAD and other international agencies are already calculating that, of the hundreds of billions of dollars of increased trade that is anticipated as a result of the more open trade system, Africa w ill actually lose a further US$2.5-3bn in the immediate future. Although these are described as mere 'transitional costs', trade liberalisation has had profoundly damaging effects upon African countries, particularly in the area of de-industrialisation. We see the new trade rules as a device to give legal force on the international plane to the trade liberalisation programmes already being imposed within the countries of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context we make the following key proposals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.1 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must adopt joint negotiating positions in the forthcoming meeting of the WTO in Singapore at the end of this year in order to expose and oppose the limitations that Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) will impose upon national investment strategies. They must also resist the inclusion within the WTO of the proposed Multilateral Investment Agreement (MIA). This would remove any governmental regulatory controls, open up African countries to foreign investors completely, and destroy local enterprises and farms. 3.2 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must similarly oppose the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) which is forcing countries to open up their service sectors to transnational corporations. At the same time, Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) are imposing further financial and legal restrictions on access to technology, with the danger of the further appropriation by private enterprise of the world's resources and human knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.3. While powerful governments are creating conditions for the rapid opening up of the markets of developing countries, AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must struggle together for the right to formulate and utilise appropriate trade and development strategies for their countries. This includes targeted and transitional tariff policies and other instruments in the interests of their economies and peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.4 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must resist trade arrangements which result in the continent being used as a dumping ground for dirty industries and hazardous materials. They must resist the over - exploitation of natural resources for trade and debt-related payments. The imposition of disguised trade-related protectionist environmental standards act as a further non-tariff barrier to the continent's ex ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.5 UNCTAD must provide analyses, information and technical support to LDCs in all future trade and other international economic negotiations to ensure that the subordination and sidelining of their interests and needs, that characterised the Uruguay Round, does not happen again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.6 UNCTAD must monitor independently the world trade system to counter the bias against the LDCs and to ensure that the WTO does not become yet another international institution, like the IMF and the World Bank, utilised by the most powerful industrialised countries in the service of their own interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4 REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harmonisation, coordination and cooperation in technical, economic, environmental, social and political spheres is essential in an increasingly integrated and interdependent world. Such cooperation is particularly important for African countries. It is the essential basis for them to combine their resources and form larger markets, and achieve economies of scale in investment and production. This would enable them to create appropriate forms of self-sustaining development, as well as participate more effectively - to the degree and in the directions that they judge necessary - in a highly competitive world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNCTAD acknowledges the importance of regional integration for LDCs, but there are contradictory trends and conflicting strategies in this sphere of international relations, as in others. In Africa w e see our governments paying mere lip service to the aims of regional and continental integration.  While signing formal cooperation and integration agreements they continue to have recourse to unilateral rather than multilateral strategies and pursue policies that create competition rather than cooperation between potential development partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context we make the following key proposals:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.1 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must resist the impetus toward 'solo' integration into a hostile global economy that is being promoted by SAPs and other unilateral liberalisation programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.2 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must enter into serious multilateral negotiations with fellow members of formal regional agreements and turn these into real processes of cooperation and integration; while at the same time recognising and supporting multifaceted and informal processes of cross-border trade and other forms of bottom-up cooperation and integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.3 AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS must make the entire process of regional cooperation and integration more transparent and democratic. It is only on the basis of direct popular participation, and as a people- driven process, that regional integration will be real, sustainable and secure, and where the rich diversity of peoples' cultures will be respected and built upon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.4 UNCTAD must support regional integration amongst LDCs by all means, including the defence, extension and utilisation of the 'special and differential' provisions inserted into the Uruguay Round a s a gesture towards the particular difficulties of LDCs. Fragile as these concessions are, the allowances for negotiated multilateral preferential and free trade agreements amongst LDCs must be upheld and implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.5 At the same time, UNCTAD also has a potentially important role to play in monitoring international trade patterns and trade agreements - particularly the latest strategies being utilised by the powerful blocs of industrialised countries to coopt or integrate existing or potential regional groupings in the rest of the world into their respective free trade areas.  These competitive struggles a re reminiscent of the 19th century scramble to carve up the world into competing 'spheres of influence' and colonial empires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5 THE ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must develop our own capacities to analyse and understand the implications of globalisation and liberalisation. In this respect, NGOs must prioritise capacity building, as well as lobbying governments and international agencies, such as UNCTAD, toward the creation of an enabling environment for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is evident that we African NGOs could do more advocacy and lobbying among civil society and towards our governments if we have information and effective analyses. In this context we are convinced that it is essential for NGOs, popular civil society organisations, academics, labour, religious and other democratic social movements to be partners in development endeavours at all levels - policy- making, negotiations, agreement monitoring and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Therefore we recommend that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.1 NGOs demand from our governments, UNCTAD and other international organisations full information and participation in the decision-making processes on all agreements and processes relating to questions of international trade and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.2 NGOs utilise such sources, together with our own independent research and experiences, to develop effective input into national, regional, and international debates and negotiations on these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.3 NGOs draw upon the experiences and understanding of our communities and constituencies in improving popular understanding of the local and national implications of globalisation and liberalisation. Popular civil society organisations should be able to evaluate and measure economic growth and development on the basis of peoples' indicators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.4 NGOs, as organised participants in the struggles for democracy and development in our countries, must link into national, regional and continental networks to ensure the most effective sharing of experiences and information, with coordinated campaigns and programmes of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.5 NGOs must create effective and mutually supportive alliances with counterpart organisations and networks in other countries of the South and the North on the basis of our shared problems, our concern for our planet and our common humanity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - African development planning ministers began Monday in Addis Ababa their 22nd annual meeting amid calls to reinvigorate the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The call was contained in speeches by the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali during the opening session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a keynote address Zenawi said change was long overdue at ECA, &quot;which was beginning to lose momentum... and limping along almost on the brink of being overtaken by irrelevance.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali, in a message, also said reform at ECA was essential for it to meet the increasing demands of member states &quot;for greater value for money, cost-effectiveness and economy the way the United Nations delivers its services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zenawi paid tribute to ECA Executive Secretary Kingsley Amoako &quot;for the wisdom he has shown in quickly grasping the serious challenge&quot; the commission was facing, by preparing the renewal program to grapple with the tasks ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boutros-Ghali encouraged the renewal process being undertaken under Amoako, saying it complements his own efforts to improve the commission's efficiency and effectiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the renewal will enable the ECA to play a pivotal role in the application of the United Nation's Special Initiative on Africa to add momentum to the continent's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recently launched 25 billion-U.S-dollar initiative aims to finance such activities as basic health, education, food security, water and sanitation, good governance and comprehensive peace-building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amoako said the renewal program's three guiding principles are excellence, cost effectiveness and partnership to create alliance for Africa's development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRIPOLI, Libya (PANA) - The Libyan health ministry ordered all public and private companies employing foreign African laborers to submit them for an &quot;emergency medical check-up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement issued here, the ministry based its decision on recent reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) on a meningitis outbreak in several sub-Saharan African countries, including Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Chad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is not a &quot;discriminatory measure,&quot; said the director of public health, Dr. Fayadan Hamza.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a telephone interview from his Syrte office, 450 kilometers (279 miles) east of Tripoli, Hamza said the check-up was a &quot;preventive measure in the interest of the African workers and the Libyan population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We did not order the closure of borders nor did we ban African labor from entering the country. We acted in compliance with the WHO report and in the interest of our compatriots and of our Arab and African brothers,&quot; Hamza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The hot weather conditions now prevailing in Libya, especially in the southern regions as well as in the towns on the Mediterranean coast favour the spread of the disease,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO said in its recent report that countries like Chad, Ghana, Mali and Niger have about 15,000 people infected with meningitis, which has so far killed 3,600 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya hosts more than one million African workers, mainly from Sahelian countries. They are concentrated in the region of Sebha, the capital of Fezzan, 800 kilometers (496 miles) south of Tripoli, but also in Tripoli and Benghazi, 1,050 kilometers (651 miles) south of Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, only one patient, from Chad, has been found with the disease, according to Dr. Mohamed Gamati, the director of the infectious diseases department at Tripoli's University Teaching Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the Executive Director of Health Affairs in the Tripoli region, Dr. Abdul-Rahmane Charef, said, &quot;A few cases are under observation.  But, there is nothing definite yet, and the results might prove negative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the census conducted last year, 450,000 Sudanese, 500,000 Chadians, 30,000 Nigeriens, 17,000 Malians and as many Ghanaians and Nigerians live and work in Libya. Some 55,000 other Africans of various nationalities also work there.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda's army council has resolved that the country's armed forces will step in to curb any violence during and after this week's presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The UPDF (Uganda Peoples' Defense Forces), in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, shall take firm and decisive action against perpetrators of violence and those that reject the method of resolving political differences by constitutional means,&quot; the council said Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council, the highest decision-making body of the UPDF, made the decision at its weekend meeting chaired by the minister of state for defense, Amama Mbabazi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any person, or group of persons who, before, during and after the elections, engages in any acts of violence, threats or intimidation or, in any other way acts or even attempts to act, contrary to the provisions of the constitution, shall be isolated, and firmly, ruthlessly and decisively dealt with,&quot; the council said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ugandans go to the polls Thursday to elect a new president. The incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, who came to power in January 1986 after five years of guerilla warfare, is being challenged by Paul Ssemwogerere, his one-time deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs. Little known politican Mohamed Mayanja is also in the race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council's statement comes at a time of public debates on whether the army will accept any leader other than Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council has listed 12 of Uganda's 39 districts, including Kampala, the capital, as areas where unrest is being created &quot;by criminal elements who want to disrupt the electoral process and destroy the peace, security and stability of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked Monday whether he thought that council's statement would be accepted as sincere since he was one of Museveni's campaign managers, Mbabazi said: &quot;You see I am capable of acting professionally. And the army council, which I chair, is a professional body&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Museveni announced that the government has sent an extra army brigade to northern Uganda &quot;to sweep the area clean&quot; of rebel activity in order to ensure peaceful elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the nation, in a radio broadcast Sunday, that there would be massive deployment of security forces throughout the country to ensure that voters were not intimidated on polling day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We (UPDF) have never been stronger thaN we are,&quot; Museveni said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local press reports said rebels of the Lords Resistance Army, operating in northern Uganda, have been instructing people in the area to vote for Ssemwogerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For the last 30 years, I have fought...so that people can vote their leaders. Do not be intimidated, we have tremendous means to deal with all multiple threats&quot;, Museveni said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and officials of his ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) Monday in Lusaka walked out of scheduled interparty talks with opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The incident occurred after the opposition side objected to him chairing the consultations, aimed at ironing out disagreements over the country's draft constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A meeting last week also failed because of procedural details, particularly on the chairmanship. Chiluba and his delegation boycotted it because the MMD wants Chiluba to chair the talks while the opposition is calling for a neutral chairperson.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week's consultations, which involved officials of both parties, were supervised by church representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, opposition leaders shouted down MMD national chairman, Sikota Wina, when he tried to introduce Chiluba as the chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, MMD national secretary Michael Sata blamed talks' abortion on the opposition leaders, who stayed on to continue the consultations among themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is clear to us (government) that you are not serious about the talks. We have plenty of other things to do and cannot be bogged down by the question of chairmanship,&quot; Sata said as he announced MMD's decision to call off the consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the walkout, opposition leaders elected the chairman of the Law Association of Zambia to chair their session, which they said was intended to plan the next strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The talks were called by the government under pressure from the opposition and other stakeholders, in a bid to defuse rising political tension before this year's second multiparty elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tension has been building since the government introduced in parliament a constitutional amendment bill that would bar first generation Zambians from becoming president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the bill becomes law, former President Kenneth Kaunda would be prevented from challenging Chiluba, who beat him in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition has also accused the government of mismanaging the just-ended voters registration exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders have also claimed the government engaged a private Israeli firm, Nikuv, to help in updating the voter registration, to rig the elections. The election date has not been announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political leaders who spoke after the MMD delegation left the meeting were almost unanimous in calling for the withdrawal of the constitutional bill presented to parliament last week. Others called for fresh registration of voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP president Kenneth Kaunda, who spoke first, said government should not expect citizens to respect a constitution in which they had no say.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Former Liberian rebel leader, Prince Yormie Johnson, said Monday in Lagos the West African Peace Monitoring Force (ECOMOG) in Liberia should be empowered to enforce the peace in his war-torn country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Liberia has deteriorated into total anarchy, and only ECOMOG can save the situation,&quot; Johnson told PANA in Lagos before the leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) met in Accra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOWAS sent ECOMOG to Liberia in August 1990 to separate the warring factions, then fighting President Samuel Doe's government in Monrovia. Doe was killed in September 1990 by forces loyal to Johnson's Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia, a splinter group from Charles Taylor's Patriotic Front.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson, in exile in Nigeria since 1992, said the situation in his country had gone beyond what a peace keeping force could handle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said ECOWAS, which brokered the August 1995 agreement on Liberia, was partly to blame for the escalation of hostilities in the last three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The faction leaders ought to have been disarmed first before being allowed to sit on the ruling State Council,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are armed and so do not feel obliged to obey the state laws,&quot; he said. &quot;Everyone must be disarmed before talking peace and not the other way round.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had some hard words for Taylor, saying &quot;his ambition to rule Liberia by force&quot; was largely to blame for the protracted war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot shoot your way to power with the AK-47 (rifle), it will not work,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision of the Liberian Council of State, of which Taylor is a member, to arrest another rebel leader, Roosevelt Johnson, on murder charges, triggered the latest breakdown of law and order in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prince Johnson said while he did not support the desposed ULIMO-J leader, &quot;Taylor has no moral justification to charge anybody with murder, when he himself murdered many people and committed other atrocities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Taylor should drop his insistence on pursuing Krahn leader Johnson to surrender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said Johnson could be tried by a properly constituted court if there was any proven charges against him, while he surrenders himself to ECOMOG and not to any factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No faction should assume leadership of the country,&quot; the ex-warlord said, quoting the 60-page book he wrote in 1991 on &quot;The Gun That Liberates Should Not Rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the United States, he said Washington's role in Liberia had been less than satisfactory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have continued to play the same role they played in 1990, basically watching us kill ourselves,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said America had a duty to do more for Liberia, since most Liberians trace their roots to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia, Africa's first republic, was founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the six-year-old war has devastated the West African country, killing some 150,000 people and made refugees of half of its estimated 2.5 million population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Roosevelt Johnson, leader of the ULIMO-J, one of Liberia's warring factions, said Monday the peace accord signed by the factions in Abuja last August, has failed and should be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a press conference in Accra, Johnson accused Charles Taylor and Alhaji G.V. Kromah, leaders of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and ULIMO-K, respectively, of violating the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson is in Accra for a special summit of the Heads of State Committee of Nine on Liberia set up by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit, which opens Tuesday in the Ghanaian capital, will assess the situation in Liberia and find solutions to problems hindering the implementation of the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a key component--the establishment of a Council of State--is in place, other provisions of the accord such as disarmament, encampment of combatants and the holding of elections, have not been implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak of fighting between Johnson's forces and those of Taylor and Kromah early in April has worsened the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reports quote Taylor and Kromah as saying they will not attend the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson said the two are &quot;greedy for power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They want to take power through the force of arms,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;My presence in Accra shows that I am prepared for peace and democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the six-member Council of State gave themselves the title of &quot;Collective Presidency&quot; instead of &quot;Vice-Chairmen&quot; as stipulated in the accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He denied that the recent fighting started because he ordered one of his bodyguards to be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The main motive is that the two (Taylor and Kromah) want me out of the way. I have said I am prepared to face a legally constituted court to clear the charges and although my lawyers have written to that effect, up till now I have not been served with any writ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ULIMO-J will fight today and tomorrow in the pursuit of freedom, peace and democracy&quot;, Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He called for the return to constitutional rule and the order that prevailed in Liberia before the civil war started in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Taylor said his aim was to rid Liberia of Doe and corrupt governance,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Doe has been dead for about six years now, but the war still rages on. Now is the time for Taylor to honor his words and hand in his arms&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson said he wants a society which is free of arms and that he is prepared to stop fighting for that cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda's three presidential candidates face each other in a crucial public debate Tuesday night in Kampala, in what is seen to be a turning point in the 39-day election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate, on the theme &quot;The Uganda I want to build,&quot; is two days before the polls Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babatunde Thomas, of Nigeria, the United Nations Development Program representative in Uganda, will moderate the debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate, organized by the Interim Electoral Commission, is modelled after a similar forum held in neighboring Tanzania before its multiparty general elections in October 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IEC took over the debate from two non-governmental organizations, the Uganda Think Tank Foundation (UTTF) and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, after the Inter-Political Forces Cooperation (IPFC), the union of parties sponsoring Paul Ssemwogerere, showed unwillingness to attend, seeing the UTTF as being Pro-Museveni front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each of the three aspirants--Yoweri Museveni, Paul Ssemwogerere and Mohamed Mayanja--will be given five minutes to present their resume and issue a political declaration on the theme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the political statements, each candidate can challenge his opponents' presentation in three minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then each of the candidates will give his ideas on seven major issues--agriculture, economy, security, corruption, children, national unity and good neighborliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wafula Oguttu, a UTTF member, said each candidate will be allowed 300 supporters in the hall. However, they are not expected to wear candidates' T-shirts, portraits or posters, nor sing in favor of their candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate will be carried live on Uganda Radio and Television. However, the print media is barred from reporting on the debate Wednesday because of fears of distortions by the opposition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (PANA) - Zambia's parliament began debate Tuesday on the controversial constitutional amendment bill that seeks to bar first generation Zambians from contesting for the post of republican president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy, which tabled the bill, proposes that only Zambian-born citizens with parents born in the country should be the only eligible to vie for the office of the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If passed, the bill would disqualify Kenneth Kaunda from another term as president. Born in Zambia of Malawian parents, he served as the country's first president, for 27 years, since independence in 1964. He has challenged the incumbent, President Frederick Chiluba, in presidential elections due this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) is demanding the bill's withdrawal, saying it is a recipe for civil strife and a negation of the country's declared commitment to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is not right that we should set the stage for strife,&quot; said Lavu Mulimba, the UNIP member who tabled the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the new law could erode any hope that citizens have in the constitution as a guarantor of their freedoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliamentarians of both the ruling and oppostion parties listened as the speaker, Robinson Nabulyato, implored the house to be &quot;critical and objective&quot; in its debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wish to remind honorable members that the house is debating a bill that has attracted the attention of (the country) and that could affect the whole country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bill contains other very contentious issues. Among them is a measure which would ban traditional chiefs from participating in partisan politics.  Instead a House of Chiefs would be set up to address traditional matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulimba challenged government's claim to be acting according to the wishes of Zambians on the citizenship issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said only 36 of the 996 petitioners to the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commission favored the measure on the citizenship clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But supporting the measure, Deputy Information Minister Valentine Kayope quoted the Bible and cited political philosophers on the need for having indigenous rulers to maintain national sovereignty and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayope accused Kaunda of killing political opponents including his one-time vice-president, Simon Kapwepwe, and former Prime Minister Nalumino Mundia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kayope said the idea of having a Zambian indigene as president was mooted well before independence in 1964. He accused former British colonial masters of imposing Kaunda on the country so he could serve their and other foreign interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders, who met in the capital Tuesday at interparty consultations that were boycotted by President Frederick Chiluba and his ruling party, have also demanded that the bill be withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint communique, the opposition appealed to government to discuss the differences emanating from the constitutional amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Independent observers who attended Tuesday's parliamentary debate thought that government members in the house had already made up their minds about voting in favor of the citizenship clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The observers also believe that members of the ruling party would endorse the proposal to declare Zambia a Christian nation in the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba, last week, addressed a party caucus of his parliamentarians at which political observers believe the party decided to block Kaunda who is campaigning to challenge the incumbent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda lost power to Chiluba and the MMD in 1991, in the country's first multiparty elections in 17 years. Kaunda held power for 27 years since independence in 1964.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The rift in the family of detained Nigerian politician, Moshood Abiola, over his treason trial has deepened with two senior lawyers locked in a legal battle over who should defend the detainee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy pitting Abiola's most senior wife, Kudirat against his son, Kola, stalled his trial proceedings Monday in Lagos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Godwin Ajayi, Abiola's lead attorney until February when Kola wrote to end his brief, had filed a suit at the Lagos Federal High Court asking for accelerated hearing of the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kola Abiola claimed his father had mandated him to tell Ajayi to stop representing him because of lack of progress in the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The elder Abiola, the acclaimed winner of the June 1993 presidential election annulled by the last military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, is standing trial for declaring himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Ajayi's suit came up for hearing Monday, another senior Lagos lawyer, Rotimi Williams, told the court he was the new counsel to Abiola.  Then, Williams requested the court to strike off Ajayi's case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola's wife, Kudirat, who was in court along with Abiola's three children, including Kola, insisted that Ajayi should continue with the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a 55-point affidavit, she admitted the rift in the family and accused her son of spareheading the group that wanted Abiola to renounce his claim to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Babatunde Belgore, who could not hide his consternation, adjourned the case until May 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political observers say the family feud could further prolong the politician's trial, which has already seen the withdrawal of several judges who claimed they had been accused by Abiola's team of bias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response to local and international appeals for his release, the administration of Gen. Sani Abacha has said the trial will go ahead.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - Cameroon asked the United Nations to dispatch an urgent fact-finding mission to the disputed Bakassi peninsula, where fighting has again flared between it and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is an urgent need to begin the fact-finding mission which the (UN) secretary-general had proposed...and which the Security Council had approved in principle,&quot; Cameroon Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono said in a letter to the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oyono said in his letter released Tuesday in New York, the &quot;increasing gravity&quot; of the situation on the peninsula, where clashes between Nigeria and Cameroon have escalated in recent days, necessitates sending a mission as soon as possible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has accused Cameroon of aggravating the situation on the peninsula, where forces of both countries have clashed intermitently since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Nigeria's permanent representative to the United Nations, Ibrahim Gambari, reported the latest flare-up to the Security Council, alleging that Cameroon had been attacking Nigeria's position with gun boats and heavy weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oyono alleged in the letter that the latest clash started when Nigeria launched attacks on Cameroon's army positions beginning April 21, and that Nigeria was planning a full-scale offensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nigeria's deployment of more and more troops and military equipment during the past few weeks is a clear indication of its intention to launch a large-scale offensive as part of its plan to annex the peninsula,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned that Cameroon would make the &quot;supreme sacrifice&quot; to defend its territorial integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked if there was any plan to send the mission soon, a U.N.  spokesperson, Sylvana Foa, said the secretary-general would discuss the issue with his advisers in the department of political affairs and the department of peace-keeping operations before taking a decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We understand that the situation in Bakassi peninsula has heated up considerably over the last few days,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council has repeatedly urged the two countries to seek a peaceful settlement of the dispute but so far has refrained from taking further action. Cameroon also reported the dispute to the Organization of African Unity and the International Court of Justice at the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a provisional ruling March 15, the court called on the two countries to desist from any action that could prejudice the rights of the other after a judgment is rendered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - Foreign ministers of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Nine are due to meet in Accra today to prepare for a summit on the escalation of fighting in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOWAS Chairman Jerry Rawlings has called the two-day emergency meeting to consider the fighting that started April 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting will be attended by Cote D'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials here say the summit will discuss the latest fighting in the Liberian capital of Monrovia and try to secure a lasting cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit hopes to put the Abuja peace accord, signed in August last year, back on track and to define a new role for the West African peace monitoring force in Liberia, ECOMOG, in the face of renewed hostilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abuja accord, designed to return Liberia to civilian rule, is far behind schedule. It is yet to secure the encampment, disarmament, and the integration of combatants into society -- all crucial military aspect of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit is expected to be attended by Dane Smith, a special representative of U.S. President Bill Clinton; James Jonah, the U.N.  secretary-general's special envoy, and O.A.U. Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chairman of Liberia's ruling Council of State, Wilton Sankawulo, and council members Tamba Tallor, Oscar Quiah and George Boley are in the country for the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, council members Charles Taylor, the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, and Alhaji Kromah, the leader of one of the factions of the United Liberation Front (ULIMO), have said they will not attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings told Sankawulo Monday that some West African countries had turned away shiploads of Liberian refugees because their resources were overtaxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jonah, the U.N. official, said West Africans were fed up with Liberia's inability to end the war and that the summit would likely demostrate this frustration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Therefore, it is up to those who have the interest of Liberia at heart to strive to bring durable peace to the war-ravaged country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I know the war has taken a long time, but some have taken as long as ten to fifteen years,&quot; Sankowulo said. &quot;It is easy to start a war but difficult to achieve peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting erupted in Monrovia when government forces tried to arrest Roosevelt Johnson, leader of another faction of ULIMO, and have him tried for murder. Johnson, who was earlier dismissed from the cabinet as minister of rural development, resisted arrest and was holed up in the Barclay Military Training Center with his Krahn forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighters loyal to Taylor and Kromah, who made up the bulk of the government forces sent to arrest Johnson, have been pounding the barracks but have met stiff resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several attempts by Ghanaian negotiators, U.N. and U.S. officials, including Assistant Secretary of State George Moose, have failed to secure a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson was flown out of Monrovia in a U.S. helicopter last week to attend the Accra meeting. He told a press conference in Accra today that Taylor and Kromah were &quot;greedy for power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They want to take power through the force of arms,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;My presence in Accra shows that I am prepared for peace and democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Johnson said the Abuja accord had been violated by Taylor and Kromah and needed to be changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;ULIMO-J will fight today and tomorrow in the pursuit of freedom, peace and democracy,&quot; Johnson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rawlings called for a cease-fire Saturday from 1 am GMT Sunday to promote security in Monrovia and provide the right atmosphere for the emergency summit. However, fighting continued sporadically Monday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The disease's belt, which by mid March was confined to eight west and central African countries, is now spreading southwards, with Mozambique and Zaire joining the list.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Libya recently ordered employers of workers from sub-Saharan Africa to send them for meningitis check-up following the discovery of a Chadian labourer who showed signs of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting cases reported in Brazzaville between April 14 and 29, the WHO's list showed that Nigeria had recorded 5,802 meningitis-related deaths between January and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Burkina Faso came second with 3,941 deaths and 38,821 cases, followed by Niger, where the disease killed 1,186 people out of 12,316 patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mali, 605 people died of the disease out of the 5,091 who contracted meningococcus, the bacteria that causes cerebral-spinal meningitis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chad had 85 deaths out of 896 cases while Benin buried 84 out of 699 patients. In Togo, the disease killed 76 out of 440 cases and in the Central African Republic 22 deaths were recorded out of 155 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other countries which reported deaths and cases were Malawi which recorded 29 deaths out of 269 cases, Tanzania (eight deaths out of 99 cases), Mozambique (six deaths out of 21 cases) while Cameroon had one death out of five cases. Ghana had only 18 cases but no deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Medical experts say meningococcus is present and lies dormant in the nasal membranes of most healthy persons. The mucus in the membranes and the natural immune system subdue the germ, preventing it from reaching the spinal cord and the brain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In case the immune system is weakened, especially during the dry season, the germ attacks the spinal cord and brain, causing paralysis and eventually death.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - The &quot;great&quot; debate between the three presidential candidates contesting Thursday's elections in Uganda flopped Tuesday after two of the aspirants failed to show up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only the little known candidate, Muhammed Mayanja, showed up.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats and members of the press were kept uninformed about the reasons for the cancellation of the debate until the last minute when a member of the Interim Election Commission, Charles Owor, made the announcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that even after extensive consultations and preparations were made to hold the debate, the commission was receiving conflicting signals from the camps of the two stay-away candidates, incumbent President Yoweri Museveni and his main challenger, Paul Ssemwogerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Early this (Tuesday) evening, it was a question of we are coming, we are not coming from both candidates Museveni and Ssemwogerere,&quot; Interim Election Commission Chairman Stephen Akabway said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United States Ambassador Michael Southwick said Ugandans had missed a great opportunity to assess the candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It would have been good for Uganda if this debate had taken place but since it hasn't, it is not a catastrophe,&quot; an official from the Germany Embassy said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We agreed we should hold the debate but since they have not come shows they have fear to confront me,&quot; candidate Mayanja said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The highly touted debate, which was supposed to be chaired by the United Nations Development Programme representative in Uganda, Babatunde Thomas, marked the end of 39 days of election campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election, the first in 16 years, will witness some 8.5 million voters choosing Uganda's first directly elected president. The results are expected to be announced Saturday and a new president sworn-in Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Kudirat Abiola, senior wife of detained Nigerian politician Moshood Abiola, appeared before a Lagos magistrate's court Wednesday on a two-count charge of conspiracy and false publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecution said Kudirat, who was arrested by police Tuesday, is to answer charges for alleged conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor and false publication with intent to cause public fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She appeared at the Igbosere Magistrate's Court with two men, one of whom was identified as a printer. They all pleaded not guilty and were granted bail in the sum of 10,000 naira each (444.4 U.S. dollars).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am very happy it's over for now, there is nothing in the charges, nothing,&quot; Kudirat told journalists after her release on bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case was adjourned till May 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat has been critical of the military government over the incaceration of her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moshood Abiola is the acclaimed winner of the June 1993 presidential election annulled by the last military regime. He is facing trial for treasonable felony for declaring himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior police spokesman told PANA the publications for which kudirat was being charged included exercise books with pictures of her husband describing him as &quot;President Elect,&quot; and others saying, &quot;Abacha get out, Abiola form a national government now, victory for democracy, victory for Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is an apparent reference to Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigeria's current military ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy inspector-general of police operations, Nuhu Aliyu, said &quot;these are exercise books, the kind used by children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a public function in Lagos last month, Kudirat alleged that the government had taken steps likely to destroy the family financially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She accused government of refusing to pay millions of naira owed to her company and those of her husband for contract jobs they had carried out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She has also been locked in a family feud with Abiola's eldest son, Kola, over the choice of the husband's defence lawyer in the treason trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She wants the original attorney, Godwin Ajayi, retained. But Abiola's son wants another senior Lagos lawyer, Rotimi Williams, to take over his father's defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A case to resolve this issue is in a Lagos court.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - South Africa adopted Wednesday a new democratic constitution, after a last minute compromise on some thorny issues, by the country's ruling coalition, the African National Congress (ANC) and the National Party (NP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A release from the South African High Commission in Lusaka said the Assembly, which met overnight in Cape Town, arrived at a compromise early Wednesday, on some of the sticky clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These included the issues of property rights and the right of employers to lock out striking workers. The other was the emotive issue of single language schools demanded by the NP of second vice-president Frederick de Klerk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party members wanted employers to be given the right to lock out striking workers and single language schools. The ANC opposed the clause, saying it was discriminatory and a &quot;hang over&quot; from the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political observers in Lusaka said the agreement has averted a possible costly referendum and or an early election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the High Commission's statement, the agreement was made possible by the NP's compromise on education and labour. It said the ANC also gave in on the NP's demands for stronger private property guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP had sought a single language policy for schools. But this was seen by the ANC as an attempt to entrench Afrikaans, the language of the former ruling white Boer community, to the exclusion of the majority African population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African schools also offer lessons in English and several other indigenous languages. Senior ANC negotiators were quoted Wednesday saying that they supported multi-language schools to promote racial integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP, which generally represents the more affluent white population, had also sought tougher action against striking workers, including loss of jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is the senior partner in South Africa's ruling coalition, established in 1994 following Nelson Mandela's election as president in April that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution guarantees some administrative autonomy to the country's regions. It also enshrines the principle of equal rights for all South Africans, irrespective of racial, religious and other distinctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This reverses the policy of white supremacy and racial segregation, which was adopted by the National Party in 1948, under the former prime minister, Hendrik Verwood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adoption of the constitution marks the climax of a democratization process that began with Mandela's release by De Klerk, after 27 years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His release was followed by negotiations that effectively ended apartheid two years ago and ushered the new political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela was inaugurated president May 10, 1994, on an interim constitution accepted by the various political stakeholders in the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, is making a six-nation African tour aimed at countering diplomatic gains made by Taiwan at the expense of Beijing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Kenya, Zemin will visit Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Mali and Egypt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Chinese ambassador in Nigeria, Lu Fengding, said at a lecture in Lagos Tuesday, that the visit is part of efforts by Beijing to strengthen political, economic and cultural cooperation with the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But analysts see the Chinese leader's tour as a diplomatic offensive to offset Taiwan's diplomatic gains in Africa at the expense of mainland China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chinese diplomats accuse Taipei of using huge financial and material rewards to secure recognition from needy African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most recent was Senegal, which spanked decades-long close ties with Beijing to recognise Taiwan to the chagrin of Chinese authorities who regard the island state as a renegade province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine other African countries -- Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Niger, Swaziland and South Africa -- have already recognised Taiwan and now maintain close political and economic ties with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the lecture on &quot;China and the World&quot; at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, Fengding said China had always maintained cordial relations with Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There will be no peace in the world without Africa,&quot; which comprises one-third of the United Nations, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The envoy also denounced what he called interference in the internal affairs of countries for the pursuit of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Human rights in the world should be through dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect among nations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taiwan, which has one of the worlds, strongest economies, is among ten leading capital exporters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The ministerial meeting of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Nine on Liberia adjourned Wednesday morning after an all-night session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana's Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah said the recess was to allow for the fine-tuning of the agenda for the committee's summit level meeting, which opens later in the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other issues, the ministers had discussed a proposal to review the role of Ecomog, the West African peace monitoring force in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also suggested the cessation of ongoing hostilities between forces of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia and ULIMO - K, on one hand and those loyal to Major-Gen. Roosevelt Johnson, leader of ULIMO-J, on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his report to the ministers, Asamoah urged them to consider the non-recognition by West Africa of any Liberian government which came about through force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He called for the cessation of reported unilateral arrests and detention of people by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia forces, safe corridors for Johnson's forces from the besieged Barclay Training Centre barracks and an end to inflammatory broadcasts on Taylor's radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asamoah said the mandate of the peacekeeping force should be redefined and a new national army trained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his report to the ministers, the Ecomog field commander, Maj.- Gen.  John M. Inienger, called on West African leaders to consider the complete withdrawal of the peacekeeping force if they cannot strengthen it to contain the new dimension of the Liberian crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said apart from the impotency of Ecomog, due to inadequate manpower and poor logistics, warring faction leaders serving on the Council of State continued to interfere and obstruct its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maj.-Gen. Inienger said recent outbreak of fighting within Monrovia, had punctured the Abuja Accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;...The question of sovereignty has been used to re-write certain portions of the Abuja Accord,&quot; he said, adding that the crisis was increasingly becoming factional and tribal in nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;..The main battle is yet to be fought since all parties to the conflict remain recalcitrant to the pleas by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the international community, to withdraw their fighters from the safe haven of Monrovia, &quot; Inienger cautioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambian Minister of Works and Supply, Simon Zukas, has resigned from the government of President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zukas, in a statement issued through the official Zambia News Agency (ZANA), said he tendered his resignation Wednesday afternoon, to President Chiluba.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I have been obliged to do this in order to (be free to) give the nation my views on national issues, in the debate on the constitution and the forthcoming presidential election,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said he considered the issues to be of national importance and above party politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do feel that for this to be so, the air must first be cleared as to the basis for presidential candidates in this election,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zukas was apparently referring to ongoing controversy on a draft amendment to the constitution, which bars first generation Zambians from aspiring to become president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition has rejected the amendment, saying it seeks to ban former president Kenneth Kaunda, from challenging Chiluba in presidential polls scheduled to be held later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition members of the parliament staged a walk-out when debates on the amendment resumed Wednesday. The Zambian parliament is dominated by Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zukas is the second cabinet minister to resign from the government, barely weeks after Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister, Dipak Patel, quit the cabinet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria warned Thursday that leaders of West African economic group, Ecowas, were getting &quot;fed up&quot; with the fighting in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the abortion of an Ecowas summit on Liberia because of poor attendance, Nigeria's defence headquarters said in lagos the warring factions in Liberia should know that the patience of the international community is running out on the country's crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ecowas has a peace keeping force in Liberia, known as Ecomog, whose troop size is now 5-6,000 troops, down from 10-12,000 when the force was first sent to the country in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The summit of the Ecowas special Committee of Nine Countries --Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Malawi, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo --was cancelled by Ghana Wednesday after only the heads of state, Ghana and Sierra Leone, showed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brig.Gen Fred Chijuka, Nigeria's defence spokesman told PANA in an interview the fact that the crucial meeting failed was a pointer that Ecowas leaders were &quot;getting fed up&quot; with the intransigence of the Liberian warlords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Accra summit was to have followed a meeting of the nine countries' foreign ministers on the renewed fighting in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chijuka said &quot;Liberians should not take countries assisting them for granted... Everybody is getting fed up with their tricks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the failure of the meeting &quot;is a very serious signal that (the Liberians) might have to go it all alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Factional fighting erupted again in Monrovia April 6 following attempts by the ruling Liberian Council of State to arrest for alleged murder Roosevelt Johnson, sacked from the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johnson, deposed Krahn leader of Ulimo-J faction, was for almost two weeks holed up in Monrovia's Barclay Training Centre under seige by forces of Charles Taylor's Patriotic Front and Alhaji Kromah's Ulimo-K.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was later flown out to Accra for the summit that never took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six-year-old war launched by Taylor from Cote d'Ivoire on 24 December 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war in Africa's first republic founded in 1847 by freed slaves from the United States, has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and rendered refugees about half of Liberia's estimated 2.5 million population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Members from Zambia's main opposition party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), Thursday staged a second walkout when parliament resumed debate on a controversial constitution amendment bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP members first walked out of the house Wednesday protesting refusal by the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) of President Frederick Chiluba to withdraw the disputed bill pending broader national consensus on some of the more controversial proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party is particularly unhappy about the citizenship clause barring citizens with parents born outside Zambia from contesting for the post of president. It is also unhappy about another clause seeking to enshrine in the constitution President Chiluba's declaration of Zambia as &quot;a Christian nation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The walkout left only Akashambatwa Mbikusita Lewanika of the opposition national party in the house, which is dominated by the MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNIP members were, however, in the house during the &quot;question and answer&quot; parliamentary session on various matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all the 23 left as soon as Speaker Robinson Nabulyato called on Lewanika to continue his debate on the constitution amendment bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his contribution, Lewanika accused the government of deploying &quot;chameleon and Animal Farm&quot; political deception to enact a constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No one can mistake a place and a time, where and when, a national leadership has risen to the occasion of moving towards determining a national consensus in good faith that reconciles differences in the nation,&quot; said the opposition member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the timing of the new &quot;discriminatory constitution&quot; on the eve of general elections scheduled for this year, justified widespread suspicions that it was intended to be selective and victimise some citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rather than &quot;standing the test of time&quot;, as claimed by the ruling party, the new constitution would only last for as long as the MMD remained in power, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is my hope that if the MMD have failed to rise to the challenge to give this country a constitution to last the test of time, a new generation of serious, patriotic and nationalistic Zambians would emerge and do it,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia, he said, needed a constitution that enhanced peoples' human rights, maintained law and order and accommodated minorities and weaker sections of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy over the proposed constitution has so far caused the resignations of two cabinet ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Works and Supply Minister Simon Zukas quit Wednesday saying he wanted to be &quot;free&quot; to air his views on the matter as a backbencher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zukas, who is of Lithuanian extraction, was not in the house during the walkout by the UNIP members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commerce and Trade Minister Dipka Patel, an Asian, was the first to resign over what he called his &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; with cabinet colleagues over the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiluba's government has brought the constitutional debate to parliament in defiance of calls by the opposition and other sections of the society to submit it to a constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They argue this would ensure maximum national consensus on areas of disagreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe ruled out the possibility of Nigeria's suspension from the Organization of African Unity (OAU) at its forthcoming summit in Cameroon, as punishment over human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a press conference here Thursday, he said Nigeria, which is facing some tough measures from fellow Commonwealth member states, would not be punished by the group of African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The spirit of brotherliness prevails even where wrongs are recogmised and taking measures against a brotherly state is not easy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African states have a problem that we are not strong enough to criticize ourselves, so Nigeria will not be punished by OAU unless some sanctions become United Nations-imposed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria was last year suspended from the Commonwealth, a group comprising Britain, its former colonies and an outsider, Mozambique, after the execution of nine minority human rights activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian military regime, headed by Gen. Sani Abacha, was warned to put its house in order or face tougher measures from the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organization created a ministerial group to follow up the situation in Nigeria. However, last month, the Nigerian government refused to meet the group led by Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The group held its meeting in April, in London, and decided to take further steps against Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures included downgrading diplomatic relations between Nigeria and Commonwealth countries, imposing visa restrictions on members of the Nigerian military government, and a ban of air links with other club countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU summit, scheduled for June, will be held in Cameroon, a Commonwealth nation. If the host nation adopts the above measures, Nigerian government leaders may not be able to attend the continental body's 32nd summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mugabe told today's news conference that Zimbabwe would not take an individual stance against Nigeria, until discussions with other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, which are all members of the Commonwealth, were complete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are looking at how our region will react to the recommendations made by the group. The SADC countries will get together and respond to the call for tougher measures against Nigeria,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures are expected to be adopted by next month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - South Africa's new constitution, the withdrawal of the National Party (NP) from that country's government of national unity and the aborted Liberia summit were the main subjects of editorials in African newspapers this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sowetan, published in Johannesburg, said the adoption of the constitution by the South African parliament was hailed by all, &quot;except the most cynical&quot;, as a historic landmark in the long struggle to transform South Africa into a true democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because it is a product of negotiation and compromise, the constitution is by definition a document that does not exclusively reflect the view of any one party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From a party political point of view this may be far from ideal. But a constitution that is not based on the will of any one political party will be a good thing for the national building process,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another South African daily, Business Day, said that the mood surrounding the adoption of the constitution Wednesday was almost reminiscent of the surges of national unity last seen at the general election and presidential inauguration of 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Almost, but not quite,&quot; it said. &quot;Acknowledgement of incipient problems has not been swept away in the euphoria this time -- and that is not a bad thing. The most important factor was the near-unanimous support for the document among participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the constitutional issues now resolved, the focus must turn to effective governance, particularly in the economic sphere. That is South Africa's real incipient crisis,&quot; concluded the daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dakar's Sud Quotidien said the NP's publicly stated reasons for leaving -- to provide a real opposition to the African National Congress (ANC) -- &quot;were far&quot; from convincing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The truth is that since the death of apartheid, the National Party has found it difficult to make its mark within the context of an era of racial equality,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It added: &quot;The withdrawal seems to be motivated more by a desire to reconcile with a part of the white community than because of a deepening rift with the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting before the poorly attended ECOWAS emergency summit on Liberia, the daily wondered whether this would the last meeting in trying to end the six-year factional war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Certain foreign ministers have not hidden their exasperation at the upsurge of violence in this country,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that Taylor was the &quot;principal factor&quot; for war in the country it said, &quot;his absence at the meeting, and that of his ally, Alhaji Kromah, works against them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hopefully&quot;, it added, &quot;the same error will not be made in Liberia as was in Sierra Leone: to organize elections in the middle of a civil war. Here (in Liberia) the belligerents are more numerous, and seem to be more power hungry than their Sierra Leonean neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Police failed Friday to bring detained Nigerian politician Moshood Abiola, on trial for treasonable felony, before a judge who had ordered that he be brought to court to give testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Chris Senlong of the Abuja high court Wednesday ordered Nigeria's inspector-general of police to produce Abiola in court so that he can help to resolve a family controversy over the choice of his defence counsel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there was another twist to the legal battle after one of the two controversial defence lawyers, Rotimi Williams, announced he was in receipt of a motion for stay of execution on the court order directing the police to produce Abiola in court.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The motion was issued by the solicitor general, Tobechukwu Onwugbufor, who said he wanted to appeal against the court order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams, who is locked in a legal battle to wrest the defence of Abiola from the previous lead attorney, Gabriel Ajayi, protested that the motion was improperly served on him. He said it was only brought to his notice a few hours before the court sitting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williams described the motion as &quot;frivolous, vexatious and shameless,&quot; saying at least, a 48-hour notice was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The senior lawyer then asked for an adjourment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Onwugbufor objected to Williams' comments, which he said amounted to dictating to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ruling on the motion, Justice Senlong agreed with the solicitor general that the motion was proper and adjourned the case until July 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola's senior wife, Kudirat, told journalists she was disappointed that her husband was not brought to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She claimed she had not seen him for almost two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The millionaire-politician is the presumed winner of the June 1993 pesidential election, annulled by the last military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is facing trial for treason after declaring himself president of Nigeria in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kudirat, who is on bail from a Lagos court on two separate charges of conspiracy and false publication, is leading a splinter group in Abiola's family, that wants Ajayi to continue with the millionaire's defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Abiola's senior son, Kola, says he prefers Williams.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's new finance minister, Herbert Murerwa, Friday said the late United States Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, had a clear vision for the economic emancipation of the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a memorial service organized in honour of Brown in Harare, Murerwa said the U.S. government official, who died in an air crash last month, was a man who had the unwavering desire to see the upliftment of African economies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Brown, we have lost a man who had a vision to see Africa, southern Africa in particular, becoming economically stable,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memorial service, organized by Zimbabwean businessmen, was attended by several diplomats, business leaders and U.S. citizens resident in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among speakers at the service was the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe, Johnny Carson, and businessman, Strive Masiyiwa, a board member of the Southern African Enterprise Development Fund (SAEDF), which Brown helped to establish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his tribute, Carson urged those who had the opportunity to interact with Brown to ensure that his dream of an economically stable African continent was fulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to ensure that the dream that Brown had does not die with his death,&quot; Carson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The late commerce secretary was instrumental in the establishment of the SAEDF, a one-billion-zimdollar (100 million U.S. dollars) credit facility funded by the United States government, to help small and medium-scale enterprises in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He met several African leaders and business people during an investment tour of five African countries, including Zimbabwe, Feb. 17-25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown and more than 30 other Americans died in an air crash in Croatia April 3, while on a business trip to countries of former Yugoslavia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He rose on a point of order to tell the house that he felt &quot;hurt and uncomfortable&quot; about the racial remarks. He then stormed out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am hurt and uncomfortable to come to the House because of the language of colour where we are seen to be different from other races,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Thursday, former Commerce and Trade Minister Dipak Patel, also of Asian origin, stormed out of parliament for similar reasons. Patel resigned earlier this year over fundamental differences with his colleagues in government on the issue of citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days ago, Works and Supply Minister Simon Zukas quit the cabinet, saying he wanted to be free of government discipline to speak his mind on the citizenship clause in the proposed constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba's government has proposed that only Zambian-born citizens, with their parents also born in the country, should hold the post of president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main opposition United National Independence Party, UNIP, Friday boycotted the constitutional debate for the third day running, to protest the government's refusal to withdraw the controversial bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zukas and Patel were not in parliament when Hamir walked out Friday.  Other notable absentees included Guy Scot, who has British origins and Yusuf Badat, who is of Asian extraction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Badat was Thursday booed by fellow MMD parliamentarians when he tried to explain that the &quot;indigenous&quot; requirement for presidential candidates could create complications. He said that it was impossible to know who was a real patriot in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environment Minister William Harrington, who is of mixed race, told parliament Friday that the presidential clause needed amendment. He said the provision was discriminatory and would result in many Zambians being barred from standing for president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harrington said there was need to define who is an indigeneous Zambian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unless the word indigenous is clearly defined, I will have nothing to do with the amendment of the bill,&quot; Harrington said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said if someone went back in history to 1500 and read about the Bantu migration, then only the Ila people of southern Zambia would qualify to be called indigenous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the constitution bill is not amended, then only the Ilas will rule Zambia,&quot; Harrigton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy minister for technical education and vocational training, Kangwa Nsuluka, suggested Friday that former president Kenneth Kaunda's citizenship be revoked because, he alleged, it was fraudulently conferred by the British former colonial government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kaunda, who had Malawian parents and is seeking to challenge Chiluba in this year's presidential elections, is generally believed to be the target of the proposed constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Provisional results from Thursday's presidential elections in Uganda indicate that the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, is leading the with 77.8 percent of the votes cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He polled 69,922 of the 86,569 votes and appears to have made a near clean sweep in western Uganda, his home area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, his main rival, Paul Ssemwogerere, appears to have performed strongly in the northern districts of Gulu and in parts of West Nile and Kampala. He polled 16,097 votes or 19.3 percent of all ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third challenger, Muhammed Mayanja, got 2,392 votes, the equivalent of 2.9 percent of the votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voting was peaceful in most parts of the country, even in the war-torn Gulu district, despite earlier predictions of violence and hooliganism. But there was a heavy army presence in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voter turnout in the capital, Kampala, was poor. The returning officer, Gordon Tumwesigye, put the turnout at an average of 50 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Museveni vowed to crush any uprising that may erupt in the wake of the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have deployed security personnel massively, including militias, and we shall contain the situation in case of any uprising,&quot; he told journalists shortly after casting his vote in his country home in Nyabushozi, Mbarara district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The winner is expected to be declared Saturday and the new president sworn-in Sunday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - The ANC NEC (National Executive Committee) met in Cape Town on 11 and 12 May as part of its regular schedule of meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main issues that were discussed were an appraisal of the current political and economic situation, a review of the ANC's preparation for local government election in the Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal, and a discussion of the ANC's state of organisation. Reviewing the current political situation, the NEC congratulated ANC constitutional assembly members for their role in piloting through one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, a constitution that reflects the aspirations of the people of our country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEC agreed that the departure of the NP from cabinet marked a further step in normalising our democratic dispensation. The immediate reason for the departure are the strategic crisis that the NP confronts and serious internal division within it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nation building, reconciliation, reconstruction and development are realities which are broader than a constitutionally entrenched coalition and indeed the latter have often hampered the fuller realisation of these goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC reasserts its commitment to the ongoing pursuits of these key tasks. The ANC NEC expects that all sections of the NP will commit themselves unambiguously to pursuing their political objectives within the framework of, and by upholding, our new constitution and respect for the country's laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the current economic situation the NEC expressed its conviction that the fundamentals of our economy are sound and so too are government policy.  We are convinced these are views shared by long term investors, both domestically and internationally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEC expressed its support for all our ministers involved in economic affairs. The only sustainable path forward lies in the effective implementation of our growth and development path informed by the RDP vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEC expressed its support for the Truth and Reconciliation commission and congratulated it for the work it has done so far. The ANC reiterates its commitment to lend its fullest cooperation to the commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - Statement by President Nelson Mandela on the National Party's withdrawal from the Government of National Unity, May 9,1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy-President FW de Klerk informed me earlier today that the National Party had decided to withdraw from the Government of National Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As you are aware, the leadership of the National Party has emphasised that their withdrawal is not an expression of lack of confidence in our multi-party democracy, the rules of which are contained in the constitution which we together adopted yesterday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the contrary, it reflects the fact that the National Party recognises that our young democracy has come of age, and would need a vigorous opposition unfettered by its participation in the Executive. We respect their judgement on this matter; as well as the party political considerations which precipitated their decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I emphasised yesterday after the adoption of the new constitution, unity and reconciliation within our society depend not so much on enforced coalitions among parties. They are indelibly written in the hearts of the overwhelming majority of South Africa's people. This is a course that the government and the ANC have chosen to pursue in the interest of our country.  It is a course that we will pursue with even more vigour in the coming months and years.<BR> The policies that the Government of National Unity has been executing are premised on the needs and aspirations of all the country's people. This applies to all areas of endeavour, underpinned by the Reconstruction and Development Programme, to improve the quality of life of the people through sound economic policies of fiscal rectitude and other measures to promote growth and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These policies will not change. Instead they will be promoted with even more focus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though the imperative of Government of National Unity was written into the interim constitution, the onus was on parties which attained more then 10% of the vote in April 1994, voluntarily to decide whether or not to take positions in cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the majority party, the ANC welcomed the fact that the NP and IFP decided to take part in the Executive, especially in the early days of our delicate transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to thank Deputy President FW de Klerk and his colleagues for the constructive role that they have played. I am confident that we shall continue to work together in pursuit of the country's interests, and that their withdrawal will have the effect of strengthening, rather than weakening, their commitment to the country's political, security and economic interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, we are firmly of the view that the National Party has a continuing responsibility to contribute to the process of eradicating the legacy of apartheid which they created. As such, we hope that their decision to play a more active role as an opposition party, does not mean obstructing the process of transformation or defending apartheid privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, I also wish to reassure all South Africans that the course that we have undertaken as a nation is bigger than any party or individual.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations - During the daily briefing on May 9, Sylvana Foa, spokesman for Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said the Secretary-General's report on Western Sahara had gone to the Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his last report to the Council, he said he hoped the identification process could resume without delay. Unfortunately, as a result of the positions of the parties, all efforts to resume that process had failed. &quot;In fact, we have identified now 60,000 persons, but there are 156,924 applicants remaining to be identified.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that, in his report, the Secretary-General concluded that the willingness did not exist to give MINURSO (United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara) the cooperation needed for it to resume and complete the identification process within a reasonable period of time. It was stalemated, and he was recommending that the process be suspended until such time as the parties provided convincing evidence that they were fully committed to resuming it without further obstacles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This means that remaining members of the identification commission will leave the area at the end of May this year&quot;, she said, &quot;with the exception of a few who will stay behind to close up shop and get their records all together&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civilian police component would also be withdrawn except for a very small number which would be kept to maintain contact with both sides. On the military side, the maintenance of the cease-fire had been a major achievement for MINURSO and, therefore, the Secretary-General was recommending that the presence be considered still essential.<BR> The Secretary-General was, however, proposing that it be reduced by 20 per cent from 288 to 230 military personnel. At the end of the day, said the Secretary-General, the United Nations could not abandon its responsibility to seek a political settlement. He was proposing to maintain a political office headed by his acting representative, and also a liaison office. The offices would maintain a dialogue with the parties and the two neighbouring countries, Ms. Foa continued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He concluded his report by stating that, &quot;although the conditions don't exist today to achieve the settlement plan, we mustn't let all our efforts go to waste, and we must build on the achievements we have made so far -- the identification of 60,000 people, the maintenance of the cease-fire. He is asking for a six-month extension of MINURSO's mandate&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Following is a statement issued by the Shell Oil Company subsidiary in Nigeria on Wednesday, May 8, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd (SPDC) offered today a plan for action in Ogoniland if agreement is reached with all Ogoni communities that company staff can return to the area in safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first priority will be to clean up all oil spills -- whether or not due to sabotage -- that have happened since the company withdrew staff in 1993, and make safe all facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time SPDC will begin to rehabilitate its past community projects where necessary and take over their maintenance to ensure they remain in good condition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will also investigate with communities the need for further development projects in the area, such as a youth training scheme and healthcare in line with the company's community assistance programme throughout its area of operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brian Anderson, Managing Director of SPDC, said: &quot;These proposals are offered in the spirit of reconciliation. All we need to start the process is the assurance of all Ogoni communities that our staff can work safely in Ogoniland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The priority is to tackle those problems facing the Ogoni people where SPDC can help, rather than to restart production. When SPDC withdrew from Ogoniland, production from the area was some 28,000 barrels a day which represented about three percent of SPDC's total production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Anderson said: &quot;The Ogoni dispute has been characterised by a continuing circle of accusations and recriminations, and we want to help break that circle. Making impossible demands on Shell or ignoring the grievances of the Ogonis is not the answer. We need to find solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPDC's plan of action would happen only following full discussion and the formal agreement of all factions and communities in Ogoniland and the Rivers State Government. Mr Anderson said: &quot;These proposals demonstrate our commitment to reconciliation. This is what we would like to do, but we cannot do it alone and we offer these proposals for discussion with Ogoni communities and the State Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would not wish any actions on our part -- however well intentioned -- to be the cause of any strife between the Ogoni people. It is vital that we have the support of the communities in which we work. That is why we are adamant that we will not work behind a security shield, and why we have made it quite clear we will not go back until we are welcomed by all Ogoni people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Anderson said that SPDC has a continuing concern about the situation in Ogoniland. &quot;This is why we have continued to provide humanitarian aid since we withdrew. We have also continued to make scholarships available to Ogoni students, and to fund the Bori farm in Ogoni which supplies much needed crop materials to Ogoni farmers free of charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SPDC believes the first step must be agreement among Ogonis to settle their own differences and agree a common future. Shell will continue to talk to all those people, both inside and outside Nigeria, who have a concern and interest in encouraging new initiatives which may lead to a way forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The priority must be to start down the road to reconciliation, and ensure that Ogoniland becomes a safe place to live and work again for both the Ogoni people, Shell and everyone else,&quot; said Mr Anderson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Lusaka - The Danish funded Petauke Youth Skills Training Centre(PAMO) has launched an ambitious tree planting programme in a bid to fight the environmental problems related to deforestation and to ensure a steady supply of timber for its future production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Being the pioneer youth furniture-factory in the country, the centre in partnership with the Forestry Department in Petauke, the area's Chief Nyamphande, and the Danish Association for International Co-operation(DAICO) have since planted between 4,000 to 5,000 trees covering about four hectares of land from late last year when the tree planting project was initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The centre's production mananger, Crispin Chirwa, felt there was need to seriously address the problem of deforestation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can see how deforestation is gradually becoming a big problem. When I came to Petauke in 1978 there was forest everywhere, now the area is all bare,&quot; Chirwa observed adding: &quot;If this tendency continues we will face serious problems like soil erosion within a few years and being a consumer of timber, PAMO has a responsibility for the deforestation and can't run away from it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chirwa disclosed that it was up to organisations like his (users of timber) to start planting new trees if the forests were to be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new plantation covering a total area of 10-20 hectares of land is expected to be planted at an estimated cost of K10 million under the funding of the Danish government in a bid to replenish the depleting forestry plantations around Petauke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the trees that are being planted are the much sought after local hardwoods, Mukwa and Melina whose numbers in the forests are rapidly decreasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also commenting on the development, district forest officer, Duetronomy Kasaro feared that with the current high consumption of the hardwoods without replanting had put a risk of extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mukwa is a threatened specie. With the present cutting rate there will be no Mukwa left for commercial use in this area in the next five years, &quot; Kasaro said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On that background, PAMO has decided to plant a high percentage of indegenous trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a press statement from the DAICO, it will take 60 years before the newly planted Mukwa can start being used but already after 10 years, fast growing trees like melina can be used for furniture production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A steady supply of timber will be provided after a 20 year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAMO was set up in 1982 to help train youths in carpentry, tailors and bricklayers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - National Party leader Akashambatwa Mbikusita Lewanika remained in his seat as the majority of the opposition UNIP walked out of parliament yesterday saying he must put it on record that there was objection to MMD's impudence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNIP walked out of parliament in protest against the government's decision to adopt the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill without establishing consensus on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The moves follows failure of the inter-party talks on Monday which had hoped to work out a last minute compromise over the hugely criticised document. MMD led by President Chiluba then walked out of the talks after failing to agree on who would chair the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kasenengwa UNIP member of parliament Patrick Mvunga who led the walkout from the House yesterday morning said the real issue was the method of adoption of the constitution and not the citizenship of the president or the length of the term of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;UNIP's position is that the constitution should be adopted by a constituent assembly,&quot; Mvunga said. &quot;We fully adopt what the citizen's convention said which is that the constitution should be adopted through a constituent assembly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He regretted that MMD seemed to have made up its mind about what they wanted to do making it a waste of time to debate the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to exercise our democratic right to dissent, we won't participate in the process of enactment,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mvunga complained that MMD had closed its doors to dialogue but he was challenged by Vice-president Godfrey Miyanda who said it was not true because the government had conceded to demands of the judiciary and was ready to listen some more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Miyanda further said he had written to Mvunga and UNIP member of parliament for Petauke Lavu Mulimba in addition to National Party president Humphrey Mulemba for them to indicate specific areas needing discussion but they had not responded to the invitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are ready to listen at all stages of the bill if you seriously want to debate we are ready to listen but if you want to walk out you are free,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mvunga insisted that the opposition had not been invited for dialogue and would therefore not take part in the enactment of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mulimba said in an interview yesterday that from the way MMD members of parliament have been debating, it showed they were not ready to compromise but he hinted that UNIP could return if the ruling party showed it could be flexible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Changes are made at the committee stage, we will be watching closely what happens there,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chadiza UNIP member of parliament Panji Kaunda shared the same view.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party secretary general Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika however said he sympathised with UNIP for the action they had taken saying: &quot;they are definitely entitled to it, it is understandable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he said the National Party would not follow the UNIP example because this was the end of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;MMD has made other attempts to bulldoze parliament and they have failed despite their numbers,&quot; he said. &quot;We will continue to put pressure and continue the struggle. Principally we must put it on record that we objected and we shall speak to the full.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the amendments in the bill were designed to meet MMD's immediate need of winning the forthcoming elections and were likely to be changed by another government once in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I hope we won't have to wait long to have a genuinely democratic government concerned about democracy than party politics,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Democratic Congress vice-president Kasuka Mutukwa said in an interview that he sympathised with UNIP for the action they had taken but he regretted that MMD was not ready to listen to reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The MMD leadership has reached a stage where consensus is not important,&quot; he said. &quot;To them might is right and they are legislating the constitution against the cries of the majority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation for Democratic Process(FODEP) secretary Bishop John Mambo described the walk out as a &quot;sad development&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia has turned down an invitation to play Uganda in an international friendly match in Kampala enroute to the World Cup qualifer against Sudan next month because of security reasons and a tight programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Football Association of Zambia (FAZ) general secretary, Hermann Mpashi, Uganda has offered to host Zambia in a two-match series but FAZ has informed the East Africans that it will not send the national team there because of the rebel war in that country and southern part of Sudan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We were offered to play Uganda but we have requested that it will not be possible for us to send the team because the programme will be tight around that time, and also we felt it would be risk to send the team to war-like conditions before such a big match like the world cup,&quot; said Mpashi, who explained that Uganda may be called instead because it would also cost FAZ a lot to fly the team to Uganda and back to Kenya to connect to Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda is engulfed in rebel-war fighting with some sections of its citizens opposed to the government, and also it harbours Southern Sudan freedom fighters rocked in a decades old war with the Islamic government of Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The first draft of the long awaited new voters register, which is being prepared by the Israeli company, Nikuv Computers, should be ready for inspection by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefing members of the press, who this morning toured the company's offices at Mulungushi International Conference Centre to familiarise themselves with progress on the exercise, Project Manager, Gershom Korda, said the first phase of the project was completed yesterday and that both the draft voters roll and voters cards should be ready by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the company had finished the most difficult part of the data processing which was that of capturing details and feeding them in the computers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now the company has safely stored details of all registered voters throughout the country in an exercise which was started last January and had to be postponed several times due to poor responce from potential voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the height of operations Nikuv had employed 270 persons on an equal number of computers who fed details into computers from documents submitted by the Elections Office, who handled the initial phase of the data capturing process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the close of business yesterday, however, the number of workers had to be reduced from 270 to 17 and that it will further be reduced to about five once all major works have been dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Korda ruled out the possibility of his company conniving with the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy to come up with register which will allow for the rigging of both presidential and parliamentary elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said sentiments by some opposition politicians that the company would also do a shoddy job were unfounded adding that all throughout the process of collecting and storing data the company had maintained maximum vigilance reinforced by a 24-hour security cordon placed on the operational centre by Zambia Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Korda showed press persons the entire process from the 'receiving bay' where duplicates and bound copies of voters' registration forms were being delivered to the company by the Elections Office under police guard up to the computers where data stored had to be entered twice in order to eliminate negligent mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Korda insisted that arrangements put in place did not allow for rigging adding that this could only be engineered at source, which so far has is unlikely since nobody has cast aspersions at the Elections Office, which has done its job most diligently and impartially.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afterwards Mr.. Korda showed reporters a sample of the cards which will be given to registered voters for use in the coming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also explained that contrarily to earlier reports the cards will not be made in Israel but in Lusaka to further lessen suspicions of rigging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from press persons the company has extended invitations to all sections of the community including leaders of opposition parties, the Church Non-Governmental Organisations and Diplomats accredited to Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The members were lead by Kasenengwa Member of Parliament, Professor Patrick Mvunga, immediately the House was about to resume debating the Constitutional Amendment Bill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The members had earlier in the day attended and participated in deliberations based on a question and answer session before they finally walked out of the House leaving only National Party secretary, Mr.  Akashabatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika on opposition seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yesterday, UNIP members again walked out and said they were not ready to participate in the enactment of the bill when a consensus on the mode of adopting it has not been reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said UNIP will only take part once invited to an inter-party meeting at which the mode of adopting the constitution will be reached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And contributing to the debate on the bill Mr. Mbikusita-Lewanika regretted that it was like the house was debating on one particular person he did not name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mbikusita-Lewanika also said, in a three hour contribution, that a comfortable national concession has not been achieved on the mode of adopting the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He noted that submissions to the Mwanakatwe Constitutional Review Commision had proposed that the draft constitution be adopted by a constituent assembly and that government should follow the people's wish over the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The MP said government has the responsibility to take instructions from the people who voted for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Zambians should have reached an agreement on the process of the constitution adding a national concessus has not been adequately provided on the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - National Party and Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) yesterday committed themselves to attending Monday's inter- party meeting with, or without, the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP vice-president, Daniel Lisulo, said the aim of the meeting would be to reach an agreement in the interest of the people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are going ahead with the meeting with or without the MMD,&quot; Lisulo said in an interview yesterday. &quot; If the MMD will not attend we shall then know as opposition parties what move to take next but we don't want any crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And ZDC deputy general secretary, Azwell Banda, said there was no peaceful for dialogue and negotiation and it was a pity the MMD leadership does not recognise and appreciate this fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We as opposition parties have agreed to meet on Monday so we can know what to do next but the government must realise it is important that the key stake holder political parties meet because dialogue and and negotiations are the only peaceful solutions to everything,&quot; Banda said in an interview yesterday. &quot;There is no substitute.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But MMD national chairman, Sikota Wina, on Tuesday maintained that his party would not bother to attend the meeting because of the issue of neutral chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Banda charged that people of Wina's likes had political back ground which knew no peaceful and productive negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He is talking like that because of his political background which is void of moral and no sufficient integrity,&quot; Banda charged. &quot; All he would like is to satisfy his ego and doesn't qualify to be on leadership levels.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambia is among the three nations in the Southern African region expecting a good grain harvest this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior economist at Southern African Development Community's (SADC) early warning unit, Phumzile Mdladla, disclosed in an interview yesterday that among the eleven country's of the Southern African region, only three countries would record good harvests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite the good rains this season most countries are anticipating deficits in their grain harvest except for only three countries namely Zambia, South Africa and Zimbabwe which expect to record surpluses,&quot; Mdladla said in an interview at the on-going grain marketing workshop.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdladla, however, assured that the surpluses in these three countries would adequately cover the deficiencies that will be experienced by the other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; A total surplus of 3.14 million tonnes will be recorded against the collective deficit of 1.29 million tonnes of white maize,&quot; Mdladla said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to information from the regional centre, South Africa expects the largest harvest with a surplus of 2.950 million tonnes followed by 255,000 tonnes by Zambia and lastly Zimbabwe's 207,000 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Zimbabwe, it is not known if the surplus would be open for exports as its policy is to have a total of over 900,000 tonnes in its strategic reserves, making the anticipated surplus far below the required grain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mdladla disclosed that despite receiving good rains, Malawi had recorded a deficit following high costs of fertiliser and farming inputs which most of its farmers found difficult to acquire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And representing the private trade sector, Grain Growers and Marketing Association chairman, George Lloyd attributed the anticipated 'bumper' harvest to good rains and increased planting by farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Cargil South Africa has shown interest in sourcing maize from Zambia .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on Zambia's harvest in relation to the Larger Grain Borer invasion, managing director of Cargil South Africa Limited, Thad Goff, felt this would have little impact on his company's intentions to source grain from the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are aware of the LGB but we feel that this will not have any problem with our intentions to source maize grain from Zambia,&quot; he said. &quot; We have better contacts with the international markets and we'll look for the best market for Zambia's maize.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba has been advised that his decision to fight everyone who questioned the political practices of his regime would soon boomerang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking in an interview yesterday opposition Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) deputy general secretary Azwell Banda warned President Chiluba of the consequences of alienating himself, his government and the country from the rest of the world by picking up fights with the international community including, most recently, her neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda was reacting to recent announcements by the government that it was now bitter with Botswana President and head of the Frontline States, Quet Masire, for proposing to dialogue with Zambia over her current political situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And former president Kenneth Kaunda, himself twice leader of the Frontline States, yesterday defended President Masire's initiative but denied he had any influence in it as claimed by President Chiluba's government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We feel very embarrassed about the damage government is doing to this country. You cannot go punching everyone from Western donors to your own neighbours in the region,&quot; Banda said. &quot;We will soon find ourselves totally isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banda said the government has insulted and picked at almost every key Western donor souring relations unnecessarily and regretted that this has now extended to respectable neighbours like President Masire and and South African president Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Masire is a Frontline heads of state chairman. There is an issue of regional stability here,&quot; Banda said. &quot;What happens politically in Zambia has an impact on the stability of the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said ZDC's position was that the government should welcome international initiative and broaden its perception of local problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD national chairman Sikota Wina announced on a live radio programme this week that President Chiluba had taken offence at the letter from the Front Line leader, President Masire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;President Chiluba has rejected the meeting proposal because there are more problems in other countries than Zambia,&quot; Wina said. &quot;There is no crisis in Zambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MMD suspects that President Masire is working at the instigation of the opposition UNIP led by former President Kenneth Kaunda whom President Chiluba is trying to block from contesting the Zambian presidency through the introduction of restrictive constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Botswana acting High Commissioner to Zambia, Clement Mphusu, said he would react after liaising with the government officials in Gaborone but doubted President Masire would have any ill motive in seeking dialogue with Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not even know if President Masire really wrote that letter which I too only heard being refered to on radio and television,&quot; Mphusu said in an interview last night. &quot;Our President has been involved in many regional initiatives but I do not know if he would want to initiate such a move in bad faith.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But former President Kaunda said President Masire was in order and it was unlikely the initiative was his alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When a member state is seen to be headed for trouble it is the duty of the Frontline States to talk with the member and advise,&quot; President Kaunda said. &quot;This is normally done only after consultation with the other members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He denied he had anything to do with the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They are barking a wrong tree, &quot; President Kaunda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But President Chiluba yesterday maintained Zambia is not in a crisis and insisted everything was under control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to two foreign journalists based in Harare at State House, President Chiluba yesterday said the situation in the country was normal and that if there had been a crisis, he would have appealed for international assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I wish to say that there is no crisis in Zambia, if the situation were so, I would have appealed for international help,&quot; President Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He revealed that there had been some unfavourable sentiments expressed by the donor community on the manner the Constitution was being handled but he defended his the government's stand on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Constitutional matters should be left to the citizens to decide for themselves,&quot; President Chiluba said. &quot;Whether or not we go wrong or right is our business.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Threats of civil strife have been sounded over President Chiluba's stand on adopting the constitution without reaching consensus and the handling of the voters roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have been physical and violent inter-party clashes which have left some people wounded while coercive arms of the government have been involved in various acts of human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General good governance principles have been of worry both locally and abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has lately been on a war path with diplomats from Germany, Norway and most recently British High Commissioner for commenting on such issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government sponsored negative press reports, in the state owned and controlled newspapers, attacking diplomats who the authorities believe are opposed the government's political practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has also declared it could do without Western donors if they will not shut up on the way it handles local issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foundation for democratic Process Secretary Bishop John Mambo said external concern is coming from events at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The outside is reacting because of the worrying heat that is here. It really looks like trouble would erupt,&quot; Bishop Mambo said in an interview yesterday. &quot;That is why we are insisting locally that all parties involved should dialogue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And early last year the government, through the Inspector General of Police, had accused some unnamed neighbouring country of training opposition insurgents to come and topple the government of President Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the fears of civil strife have been expressed by the church, NGOs, trade unions, and opposition politicians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The following is the text of remarks on May 8 by U.S.  Ambassador Karl Inderfurth during the debate in the United Nations Security Council, which voted unanimously to extend the mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) for two months:<BR> Mr. President, throughout the peace process, the United States has fulfilled its commitment to be Angola's partner for peace. We have steadfastly condemned all violations of the Lusaka Protocol, and insisted that both sides honor their commitments in a comprehensive and transparent fashion. We have also acknowledged actions, taken by either side, that advance the cause of peace and national reconciliation. This course of action, we believe, increases the credibility of the Lusaka process in the eyes of the parties, the Angolan people, and the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this spirit, we must criticize delays in quartering yet at the same time welcome recent progress in the process of quartering UNITA troops. As of May 6, more than 30,000 UNITA soldiers had officially registered, with the total expected to rise to 35,000 by the end of this week, which would represent more than half of UNITA's declared troops levels. The last-minute movements of thousands of troops to quartering areas in the final days before the renewal of UNAVEM's mandate is typical of UNITA's pattern of lurching forward in fits and starts towards its goals. This pattern does not help cement faith in UNITA's overall commitment to the peace process. It is essential that UNITA continue the quartering process without further delay or interruption. Unless real soldiers bearing real weapons are quartered, the peace process will not move forward. It is also essential that the Angolan government complete its obligations to pull back its forces and barrack the anti-riot police, under UNAVEM's supervision, without delay or subterfuge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both sides must work together to finalize arrangements for military integration, including reaching agreement on the eighteen UNITA generals who are to be a part of the joint military command. The deadline for their completion is now May 15 -- far beyond the date initially forecast for the conclusion of the military talks. The delay has meant that some of the UNITA troops have now been in quartering areas for several months. They are eager to be either demobilized or integrated into the joint army. Both sides must work together to ensure that UNITA personnel move quickly out of the temporary quartering areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This resolution reflects the Security Council's continuing impatience with the overall slow pace of the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol. We expect the parties to live up to the agreements they reached in Libreville, and to the May Calendar of Actions they freely adopted. During the next two months we expect to see the formation of a joint military command and the commencement of the integration of UNITA forces into the Armed Forces of Angola, the essential foundation for the Government of National Reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the next two months we also expect to see the two parties take decisive action on one of the most urgent problems facing Angola -- the threat posed by landmines. The United Nations estimates that there are between nine and fifteen million landmines in Angola. It estimates that eight million Angolans, of a total population of just under thirteen million, live in mine-infested areas of the country. Exact numbers of mine casualties in Angola are impossible to obtain, but current estimates of amputees range from 40,000 to 70,000, with an additional 70,000 killed by landmines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. President, the suffering of Angolans as a result of this plague of landmines will not end with the coming of peace. These hidden killers will continue to haunt Angola for years to come, adding to the number of casualties every week, destroying lives, hopes and dreams, and slowing economic recovery. It is for that reason that the Council, in its Presidential Statement of April 24, 1996, and today's resolution, has called for the Government and UNITA to destroy their stockpiles of landmines and to begin this process by a joint public action to underscore the commitment of both parties to get rid of these horrific weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are hopeful that such an action -- in the form of a joint public ceremony involving Government and UNITA officials -- could be scheduled in the near future. We would also like to acknowledge the step taken yesterday by the government in which 300 landmines held in the central military zone were destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We wish to commend the Secretary-General's Special Representative, Maitre Beye, the Force Commander of UNAVEM and all the personnel of UNAVEM III for their dedicated and courageous service in the cause of peace. We also wish to acknowledge the generosity of the troop contributing countries, eight of which are members of this Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. President, in closing, the U.S. wishes to remind the parties, once again, of the urgent need to take advantage of this window of opportunity to bring peace, reconciliation and recovery to their country. The Angolan people have suffered enough.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - The following statement was issued by the Free Angola Information Service, which is registered with the Justice Department as an agent of the Angolan opposition movement Unita:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jardo Muekalia, the UNITA representative in Washington, expressed concern that the United Nations Secretary General's April 30 report on the United Nations Verification Mission (UNAVEM III) provides an incomplete and misleading picture of the complex Angolan reality. He said, &quot;The Secretary General's report does not reflect the latest developments on the ground, and its unbalanced approach encourages hard-liners who are still committed to a military solution. Its central flaw is that it reduces the peace process to the quartering of UNITA soldiers and ignores or glosses over the Government's obligations. In addition, it fails to address critical issues like the continued presence of mercenaries in the Government ranks or the failure of the Government to withdraw its troops back to the barracks in Benguela, Cuanza Sul and Huambo provinces where more than 24,000 UNITA soldiers have reported to UN supervised quartering areas and disarmed.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muekalia pointed out, &quot;On the contrary, the Government has concentrated troops and mat6riel in strategic areas which threaten the quartering areas without an adequate response by UNAVEM. This creates a psychology of fear and has slowed down the quartering process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNITA Representative expressed pride that UNITA had carried out its commitment to Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye and President Clinton's Special Envoy, Paul Hare, by quartering 30,000 soldiers by May 8.  In fact, 31,443 soldiers, more than half of its troop strength, was registered and disarmed in quartering areas by today, May 6. This contrasts with the failure of the Government to initiate the collection of more than 700,000 illegal military weapons in civilian hands in Luanda or to send even 20 percent of the Rapid Intervention Police to the barracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jardo Muekalia said that the Government was dragging its feet in passing an amnesty law that covers the entire period of the war, back to 1975. &quot;This is easy and can be accomplished with the stroke of a pen. Failure to expeditiously pass a comprehensive amnesty law gives rise to suspicions in UNITA that the Government wants to try UNITA military officials for war crimes as it has threatened so many times in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNITA Representative concluded, &quot;President Savimbi and the entire UNITA leadership are committed to the full implementation of the Lusaka Protocol as the key to a durable peace and genuine reconciliation in our country. A balanced, judicious approach is needed. Playing the blaming game is counterproductive. The Government, UNITA and UNAVEM must all expeditiously fulfill their obligations. The peace process must be seen as a set of reciprocal obligations.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Prime Minister Meles Zenawi yesterday received and held talks in his office with the visiting American trade mission on the situation in Ethiopia and Ethio-US relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prime minister briefed the American delegation on the policies mapped out and measures being taken by his government with the aim of bringing about rapid economic development in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are plenty of investment opportunities for American investors, Ato Meles told the mission, adding the current visit of the delegation would further consolidate the existing ties and co-operation between Ethiopia and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the structural adjustment programmes carried out so far have registered commendable results in speeding up economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the delegation said their visit to Ethiopia has enabled them to identify fields of American investment and opened a window of opportunity for knowing the country better than ever before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The visit, they said, will also help consolidate bilateral relations and co-operation between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopian members of the delegation said Ethiopians residing in the U.S.  were desirous of coming to their country and investing in various devevelopment sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective reality in Ethiopia is entirely different from what they hear in the U.S, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The positive development trends in this country should clearly be explained to Ethiopians in the U.S. with a particular emphasis on those in Washington D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trade mission is comprising members from the agricultural, industrial, mineral, transport, finance, insurance and communications sectors of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -South Africa and Zambia meet for the first time at club level on Saturday and the clash between Orlando Pirates and Mufulira Wanderers could produce a classic African Champions' Cup tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pirates are the defending champions after ending an 11-year North Africandominance of the leading club competition organised by the African Football Confederation (CAF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mufulira, back in the big time after a 17- year absence, know that no champions have successfully defended the title since Tout Puissant Englebert of Zaire in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it would be unfair to downgrade the unique achievement of Englebert, it must be judged against the fact that considerably fewer clubs entered the cup then.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wanderers are so desperate to dethrone the kings that they have opted to stage the second-round match at the Shinde Stadium in the Copperbelt town of Mufulira instead of the Independence Stadium in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So what is so strange about playing at home? Well, Zambian clubs are not exactly rolling in kwacha and the stadium in the capital holds three times more spectators than that in Mufulira.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wanderers have decided to tackle Pirates on a pitch which falls short of the standard they are used to in South Africa, and where the spectators can almost touch players sprinting down the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems certain to be an intimidating atmosphere with about 12 000 fanatical Zambian fans (the official capacity is 10 000, but they always seem to squeeze a few more in) baying for the blood of the Buccaneers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not that Pirates are newcomers to this situation, having gone to Abidjan last December and defeated ASEC in front of more than 40 000 Ivorians dressed in identical yellow outfits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also forced a draw in Nigeria, where visiting teams do not exactly get red-carpet treatment, and most of the cup-winning squad are likely to be in action this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A notable exception is Mark Fish, who made his farewell appearance for the boys in black and white last weekend in a disappointing 0-0 draw with South Korean visitors Ilhwa Chunma in the Afro-Asian Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Make no mistake, the Big Feeeeeesh will be missed. If he had travelled to Lusaka this week who knows how many bottles of the pride of Charles Glass he might have consumed during the three-hour flight north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But come match day the mop-haired defender who loves to go a roaming would have been in the thick of the action, defending as if his life hinged on the result and attacking at every opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Guy-Roger Nzeng, brought from Gabon to replace Fish, cannot play because he was not registered, so there may be a recall for &quot;Shoes&quot; Lushozi, one of the heroes of Abidjan but not a regular first-team player this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking of team selection, these are difficult days for those who try to peep inside the mind of Pirates' Russian coach Victor Bondarenko and predict his line-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, the Buccaneers largely chose themselves with inspirational goalkeeper Williams Okpara operating behind a back four of Phiri Tsotetsi, Fish, Gavin Lane and Edward Motale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In midfield, Brandon Silent and Helman Mkhalele played wide with captain Innocent Mncwango and John Moeti operating in the engine room where skill must be accompanied by strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only in attack, where Jerry Skosana, Marc Batchelor and Bruce Ramokadi contested two positions on the team sheet, was there any degree of uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under Bondarenko, former Nigerian youth international Okpara remains a permanent fixture, and affords Pirates the luxury of having international-class goalkeeper Wade du Plessis warming the bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the back the system and the personnel constantly alter, with Bondarenko reasoning that if the opposition have only two forwards, Pirates need only three defenders (two to mark and one to sweep).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This allows the man who does not speak much English and communicates with the squad through son Alex to add another midfielder, but Mncwango often does not make it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ask those who know South African football and most will tell you that Mncwango is undoubtedly among the most gifted midfielders, but a figure that appears overweight may reveal why his promise remains largely unfulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attack poses the biggest problem, with Pirates lacking consistent penetration against Ilhwa Chunma and often being guilty of finishing which would make a schoolboy blush.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Footballers are only human (fans please note) so Ramokadi must not be dragged screaming to the stake for missing a late opportunity to put the Buccaneers in front last Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is surely cause for alarm that a footballer rated among the best prospects in South Africa can somehow manage to balloon the ball over the bar from inside the small box with only one defender to beat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mufulira, Pirates forwards should enjoy more space as Wanderers press forward in search of the goals they hope will reduce the return match in South Africa on June 22 or 23 to a formality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wanderers are making their third appearance in the Champions' Cup, reaching the semi-finals in 1977 and going out in the first round two years later after somehow squandering at home a four-goal, first-leg lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The class of '96 is led by African Nations' Cup midfielder Vincent Mutale and includes above-average players in goalkeeper Collins Mbulo, defender Allan Kamwanga and leading scorer Bilton Musonda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like so many regional derbies, this match could hinge on which team keeps its nerves best, and Pirates gained precious experience in this department last year from visits to Nigeria, Uganda and Ivory Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While victory would be the natural first choice, if the Buccaneers can walk off the Shinde Stadium on level terms as dusk descends over the Copperbelt, they will be well-placed to reach the quarter-finals next month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - No matter which way you cut the cake, professional golf in this country has some serious problems to address. And there is the inescapable feeling that it has been coming for a while.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It came to a head this week when the South African Professional Golfers Association threatened to withdraw its backing of the Pro Afrique Tour, an action which would effectively rule the second circuit as a non-starter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forget for a moment the issues involved and look at the situation which has caused the communications failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the root of the problem is the false concept advanced by the PGA that the main FNB Tour and the old Winter Tour constitute a single circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In reality, it all breaks down into three distinct segments: the European-sanctioned tournaments, those which used to form the backbone of the old Sunshine Tour without the European connection, backing and cash rewards, and the tournaments for the stay-at- contingent, played for lower purses in areas usually out of the urban mainstream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True, the Order of Merit -- the points-for-rands-won grading system -- operates on a year-round basis, awarding points to those who play the winter section of the tour. It still doesn't really level the playing fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Into this ungainly mixture was thrown the Pro Afrique Tour, backed by sporting goods giant Wilson and offering -- in some instances -- more attractive monetary rewards than the Winter Tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a recipe for the confrontation which has duly arrived with Wilson suspending their sponsorship of the Pro Afrique until some clarity on the issue bubbles to the surface.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You can sympathise with the PGA and understand their annoyance when a cheque to cover prize monies bounced. This, say the Pro Afrique sponsors, was an administrative slip- up. One would tend to see this as fact. A company of Wilson's stature and reputation is hardly likely to cut their own throats in the market by doing something as foolish as issuing rubber cheques on purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What remains a mystery though is why both parties have seen fit to air this particular piece of dirty linen in public rather than sitting down and sorting it out behind closed doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PGA now wants all prize money guaranteed up front a week in advance and a veto on any financial institution providing backing for the rival circuit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without taking sides, these would seem reasonable demands given the problem with payments and, should Pro Afrique become part of the overall tour as the PGA demands, given the FNB's past and current investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having two cirucits working at what looks like cross purposes would seem to lend some weight to Pro Afrique entertaining a toenadering with the PGA, especially as the body wants a bigger say in running the Pro Afrique tournaments and an assurance that there is no clash of competing tournament dates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The body which represents this country's professional players also wants Pro Afrique to stop using the designation &quot;tour&quot;. This is where you have to scratch your head. That surely is nitpicking of the type which tends to make one wonder whether the bankers or the golfers are running the game. But until the whole issue is thrashed out -- and perhaps some sense returns in the form of demarcating what tournaments are really worth in the eyes of the public and sponsors -- there is little to do but sit back and wait it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What does seem imminent though is a situation where there are no real winners ... and where the players come out as losers in the long- term.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Durban must qualify as South Africa's capital of paradox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of residents celebrated a week of political crisis in the city -- shootings outside the civic centre by armed marchers, threats to bomb the truth commission hearings and talk of escalating civil war over local government elections next month -- by heading to the beachfront to see some of the babes from Baywatch who have arrived for an international lifesaving competition, or camping out under tropical trees at the Botanical Gardens to catch Chris de Burgh singing anti-war songs and other hits at his Beautiful Dreams concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hotels were chock-a-block as hundreds of delegates poured through the airport gates to attend the Indaba, South Africa's biggest tourism exhibition, on the morning that KwaZulu-Natal Finance Minister Senzele Mhlungu told the provincial legislature in his budget speech that the industrial region around Durban had experienced an economic growth rate higher than the rest of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statistics and the upbeat mood at the tourism expo (&quot;it's the biggest and busiest we've had so far with just under 100 delegates from all over the world&quot;) contrasted grimly with the rings of yellow chalk on the pavement outside the centre hall which detectives left to mark the position of bodies from Saturday's shooting, and also the agonising testimony presented at the commission in the Durban Jewish Club about how trade unionist Professor Sibankulu was murdered and mutilated in 1992.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the delegates from Mozambique's tourism authority remarked on a bus drive through the city that the palm trees on the beach front and flamboyants growing in between high rise buildings made him think a little of Maputo. It would appear, however, the similarity stops there. For the city, despite being surrounded by civil war and endemic violence of the type that wracked Mozambique's economy, appears to be going through boom times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across the way from the travel exhibition in the Durban CBD, construction teams are busy building one of those barometers of international business confidence: a Hilton hotel. A consortium of investors from Pacific Rim countries is pouring money and concrete into a new development on the north beach called the Pavilion Site. The Malaysian corporate giant, Renong, is bidding desperately against British capital to build the city's version of Cape Town's Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Plans have been approved for a half-a-billion- rand golf course and lodge development in a dune forest at Zimbali further up the coast while construction teams are busy putting up new office blocks in nearby Umhlanga Rocks and Ballito Bay. The provincial government had approved R25-million to upgrade the Durban International Airport as a short-term measure before construction of a new facility for jumbos begins at La Mercy on the North Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Official statistics show that the finance minister was probably close to the truth in his budget speech. Economic vibrancy in the city centre is apparently reflected in the rest of the economy. Official statistics show the KwaZulu-Natal Central Coastal Area, the industrial hub of the province, grew at a rate of 2,69% -- higher than the national average of 2%. Central Statistical Services figures show the province attracted a large chunk of new investment in the country: a 0,1% growth per annum compared to minus 0,1% for the country as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out at sea, large freighters queue up on the horizon. Plans are afoot to expand the harbour, to the chagrin of environmental groups who are worried about the way this will impact on the already strained ecology of the Umgeni estuary. Engen is expanding its refinery at the industrial complex surrounding the harbour while Toyota has just announced it will upgrade its car manufacturing plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What explains this apparent breach of a simple economic lesson that political violence scares off foreign investment and economic growth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The obvious reason is that, except for Saturday's violence in the city centre, the trauma of KwaZulu-Natal's political violence is mainly confined to the province's rural areas. The low-intensity civil war has created about half-a-million internal refugees in a province of nine million people. Many of them can be seen sleeping under plastic bags on the streets or begging to wash your car on the promenade. But mostly these people keep their presence, and their stories of extraordinary pain, to themselves. The crime rate has jumped a little but it is nowhere near the level of Gauteng or the Cape Peninsula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is an anomaly,&quot; says John Bryce, director of the Durban Chamber of Commerce. &quot;But basically what we are seeing is the decline of the gold-mining industry in Gauteng and a revival of the manufacturing sector which is attracted to Durban and the province by its excellent port facilities and a relative abundance of fresh water in rivers, the shortage of which is a real constraint on the Highveld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The irony is that there is mostly a normal state of affairs. Life on the streets of the city is not tense despite the violence. Even if you go into the city hall (where the weekend shootings took place) you will find ANC and IFP councillors joking with each other and teasing each other,&quot; says Gary Cullen, regional director of the National Business Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes the province's businessmen have become highly pragmatic by adapting to the violence so they can take advantage of the province's other economic attractions. &quot;There are a couple of business leaders who support the provincial government's federalist agenda and are opposed to central government hegemony. but generally business sees the violence as a spat between rival power groups, and there is a general feeling that it is the politicans who must get their act together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some countervailing winds though. This week President Nelson Mandela was in Maputo to support the expansion of that city's harbour and endorse Transport Minister Mac Maharaj's ambitious transport corridor to link Gauteng industry to its expanded export facilities. The development poses no immediate threat to Durban and Richard's Bay's ability to handle 80% of the country's harbour traffic, mainly because Maputo's port is too silted and shallow to take big containerised cargo ships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But sources in the trade and industry ministry say the corridor is being pushed as an insurance policy against the prospect of a secessionist province, and there are signs that central government is encouraging new capital investment projects in areas outside KwaZulu-Natal. Alusaf, for example, is looking at a major new smelter in Maputo instead of Richards Bay where it already has a state-of- the-art aluminium plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is more economic activity in KwaZulu- Natal than any other part of the country,&quot; says Bryce. &quot;But the violence and political instability here must be unsettling to business. If I were sitting in London with a bit of money to invest and like KwaZulu-Natal because of its traditional ties with England I would probably wait and see what happens here. It is possibly what people are doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there is no prospect of this port city being afflicted by the Maputo syndrome, business people are concerned that the escalating violence will eventually stall the mini-boom that Durban is currently experiencing in the face of the province's travails.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Kwazulu-Natal's elections are still in jeopardy despite a unanimous central government decision this week postponing the polls by one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha Freedom Party local government MEC Peter Miller's warning the delay would create enormous logistical problems was seconded by independent election workers who say the decision was a recipe for &quot;chaos&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress MP and local government spokesman Mike Sutcliffe dismissed the criticism, arguing that IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi had sanctioned the decision and the delay would allow time to repair &quot;fraudulent voters rolls and for candidates whose names disappeared from the voters roll to re-register&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Election workers in Durban, however, warned the delay was itself &quot;a serious threat to elections&quot;: They say one month was insufficient to re-open voters rolls and complete the subsequent court certification process in time for the poll.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, election preparations were already in place for May 29 and polling stations would be difficult to reschedule with pupils expected to sit examinations at schools which make up 90% of polling stations. Ballot papers would have to be reprinted, to reflect new candidates and the new date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hundreds of election workers --including many professionals who had taken time off work for the May poll -- would have to be reorganised, and costs would increase sharply as venues and equipment would have to be re-booked: &quot;We have already rented containers to hold equipment for each polling station. The containers cost R10 per day and we have about 600 of them. Who is going to carry that cost?&quot; asked one election worker. &quot;What people don't realise is that fraud goes along with chaos. They have just introduced chaos into this election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;vague&quot; new election date -- on or before June 26 -- was also criticised by election workers who said they were unable to begin making new arrangements until a definite date was set: &quot;There is no way these elections will take place in one month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Durban, even a three-month delay would cause problems. This is the third delay we have had and people are fed-up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC provincial leaders say the special Cabinet meeting where the decision was taken said the one-month postponement was the result of heavy negotiation between the ANC -- which wanted a three-month delay -- and the IFP which wanted the poll to proceed as planned. The National Party had apparently proposed a 20-day delay and this was eventually upped to 28 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Multi-party accolades about the unanimity of the decision, however -- similar to that expressed when the province's swiss cheese- like constitution finally received the backing of all seven political parties in the provincial legislature -- masks the important issues left unresolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All parties concede the delay will provide few solutions to the underlying problem plaguing prospects for free and fair elections: political violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death of at least seven candidates in the past two months, the widespread existence of &quot;no-go&quot; areas for all political parties, the KwaMashu attack on the royal palace and the shooting chaos which erupted in central Durban last weekend during a march by thousands of IFP supporters underline the volatility of the province which has been left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While KwaZulu-Natal SAPS Commissioner Chris Serfontein has argued the security forces are ready and able to secure a climate of stability in the province sufficient for polls to proceed, their overwhelming unpreparedness for last Saturday's mayhem did little to bolster such confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of IFP supporters were allowed to march through the city centre armed with &quot;cultural&quot; and other weapons in blatant contravention of the ban on the carrying of such weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAPS Director Steve van Sittert, who was responsible for security in Durban during the march, said before the march he had &quot;between 40 and 50&quot; officers stationed around the city -- a pittance given the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked why no attempts were made to disarm the marchers, Van Sittert said his priority was to &quot;manage the crowd and then open a docket against the organisers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While IFP leaders promptly disassociated the party from the fiasco, the bold leadership of the illegal march by IFP MP Thomas Shabalala belied the claim the marchers were mere &quot;hostel residents&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Durban march, the third by IFP supporters in open defiance of the act banning the carrying of dangerous weapons, underlines the impunity with which the party's leaders are allowed to act by the province's security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAPS Director Bala Naidoo said neither the march violence -- in which three policemen were injured -- nor last week's march by hundreds of armed KwaMashu hostel residents on the local police station to demand the release of suspects arrested in connection with the attack on the royal residence -- had affected the security plan for the elections: &quot;No, nothing has changed.  We have already started our pre-election phase which will now be postponed because of the new date, but we will resume it later with 600 extra policemen. Then our election phase and post-election phase will continue as planned,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the IFP, the weekend events will not have done its campaign to woo crucial minority voters much good. White and Indian voters who witnessed Saturday's events are unlikely to be attracted to the party whose supporters sent them scurrying for cover in their shops and homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The involvement of warlords like Shabalala will be a continuous headache for IFP secretary general Ziba Jiyane, who has tried to disempower warlords in the party's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His failure to have Shabalala suspended from the party's national council, however, points to the continued dominance of military interests over political ones in the party's leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's task will be to maximise the political benefits of this reality and turn the recent events into votes. Attempts to mobilise its fragmented structures through mass action have now been reduced to a handful of prayer meetings and small marches in an effort to avoid conflict. With little hope of resolving violence in time for the poll, the ANC has to quickly answer the key question being asked by its supporters: &quot;Why should we lay down our lives for the ANC?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The rationalisation, restructuring and financing of corporate South Africa is gaining momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, R19,7-billion was raised in new capital from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (R10-billion in 1994), surpassing the 1992 record of R12,3-billion.Of the capital raised, R6,8-billion was through rights issues (R2,9-billion in 1994), R5,4-billion through scrip dividends (R2,3-billion) and R1,7- billion through share issues for cash (R3- billion).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JSE saw 27 new listings and 28 delistings, leaving the number of listed companies at 639, with a market capitalisation of R1 022-billion at the end of 1995 (R1 129-billion this week). Outside the JSE, the value and number of mergers and acquisitions in South Africa rose sharply in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A feature of this corporate restructuring is the increasing number of firms unbundling -- Anglo's JCI, Rand Mines and M-Net's delinking of Multichoice were the principal deals in 1995.Certainly many of these deals do improve efficiency and performance by adding not only economies of scale but by rationalising existing assets -- but not all do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robin McGregor, publisher of Who Owns Whom, feels the corporate restructuring &quot;could aggravate the economy's lack of competitiveness, which is already alarming&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McGregor is not alone in believing some of the blame lies with the high levels of concentration in the economy. The figures McGregor uses are from his 1992 survey, which found JSE-listed firms accounted for half South Africa's gross domestic product. &quot;This would not have changed much,&quot; he says.At the end of 1995, McGregor found Anglo accounted for 37,1% of the JSE's market capitalisation, Sanlam 12,4%, Old Mutual 11,2%, Rembrandt 7,8% and Liberty 7,3%. Ernst &amp; Young, the auditor, identifies 323 deals worth R43,4- billion (only 184 of the deals disclosed values) last year, against 152 deals in 1994 valued at R30,5-billion, R8,1-billion in 1993 from 184 deals, R13,4-billion in 1992 from 193 deals and R12,5-billion from 226 deals in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1995, five deals accounted for 60% of R26,3-billion in total value.  The largest, R8,7-billion, was the merger of the tobacco interests of Remgro and Swiss-based Richemont, controlled by the Rupert and Hertzog families.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The creation of a huge South African oil company is firmly back on the agenda of those in government quietly plotting a new-look oil industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scheme originally involved a link-up between Engen, Sasol Oil, and the state's bag of oil assets, but government sources said this week that Total SA could also be part of it. The idea of a &quot;South African National Oil Company&quot; (Sanoco) has popped up several times over the past year as a possible key feature of a revamped oil industry. But its government backers have never discussed it openly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They have flouted the so-called transparency of the new government and kept their plans to their dark, smoke-filled rooms. Is it because they are afraid this massive plan has no industrial merit?&quot; asked one industry commentator. And the companies involved have either refused to comment or expressed reservations. The plan, hatched in the Trade and Industry Department, was initially dismissed by stock exchange analysts and most senior oil company officials as being rooted in impractical, misplaced nationalism. The scheme then gained more credibility, with others in government -- including the Finance Department -- planning reforms of an industry geared to sanctions-busting and keeping foreign oil companies happy.  Some deregulation of the intricate rules which guarantee oil companies their margins and keep out new players is likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So those who believe South Africa cannot be left to the mercy of the international oil majors in a deregulated market say it is the answer. &quot;There is a strong rationale for having a large, maverick player in the industry,&quot; said one of the scheme's government backers this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last August they had to put their plans on ice just as the first phase of the scheme was about to fall into place. Sasol Oil and Engen appeared poised to merge, then Total SA, which jointly owns the Natref oil refinery with Sasol, spoiled the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The French-owned company said Sasol's quiet reshuffling of its stake in the refinery ahead of the merger had given it a pre-emptive right, so it and Sasol put the matter up for arbitration in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week Sasol said it and Total SA had resolved the matter, but were tight-lipped on the terms of the agreement. Government sources have confirmed analysts' speculation that Total SA was pacified by being included. The sources said the resolution of the dispute had resuscitated their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither Engen nor Sasol would confirm whether they had restarted merger talks, but one analyst said: &quot;You can bet they have.&quot; The merger would be particularly beneficial to Sasol as it would give it an entry into the retail market. At present, in exchange for the oil companies guaranteeing to buy Sasol's synthetic fuel, Sasol stays out of retailing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked about the status of talks, Sasol communications manager Alfonso Niemand said that after settling the dispute with Total, Sasol was &quot;considering its options&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Engen company secretary Douglas Evans said the logic for Engen's involvement with Sasol Oil remained, but the company would have to &quot;review where matters lie&quot; eight months on. Senior Total officials could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other oil industry players have either rubbished Sanoco or expressed concern that such a big player would be a threat in a deregulated market.  They are particularly keen to know the state's role in the proposed company -- not surprising considering their long-standing opposition to the subsidies handed to Sasol and Mossgas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They also want to know what the state's stake in such a company would be. Indirectly, government has a 23% stake in Sasol. And the scheme's planners hope to include the state oil companies housed in the Central Energy Fund (CEF), although they say these are not central to their plans. The CEF companies include Mossgas, which could be sold this year, and the state oil trading company, the Strategic Fuel Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government officials behind the scheme appear unfazed by the opposition, which includes some of the senior officials of the very companies they want to merge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One said this week that even if the companies' managements were wary, there was a lot of &quot;commonality&quot; among their shareholders. Gencor is a major Engen shareholder and Rembrandt is a big Total SA shareholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this determination is perceived as government meddling by industry players who want a much reduced state presence. This suggests Sanoco's pushers could face an uphill struggle exposing their plans to the cold light of day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau is to appoint advisers on revamping and privatising state assets early next month, resurrecting the government's privatisation plans that were temporarily buried while negotiations continued with trade unions on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The imminent appointment of these advisers coincides with Post, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Minister Jay Naidoo's comments this week that Telkom is pressing ahead with plans to sell off a 25% stake in Telkom to a strategic equity partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A representative from Sigcau's department said the advisers should be appointed in the first week of June -- about six months after the first deadline to tender for the work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sigcau secured a budget of R10-million for the team, who will report to government departments involved in restructuring and privatisation, apart from Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting which is to get its own advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The restructuring and privatisation drive is expected to be overseen by Deputy President Thabo Mkeki, who announced the first wave of government privatisation targets in December last year to a chorus of union disapproval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His announcement of plans to sell stakes in Telkom and South African Airways and all of Autonet and Transkei Airways triggered a wave of union protests, which led to government and labour's negotiation of the National Framework Agreement on state asset restructuring -- a pact that spelt out basic policy and principles on restructuring and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the negotiations, government agreed to freeze plans for the appointment of its advisers and set aside a further R3-million for additional advisers for labour. Sigcau's representative said this money would be handed over soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Naidoo said this week that talks with the unions on the sale of a stake in Telkom were progressing well. But Post and Telecommunications Workers Association (Potwa) president Lefty Monyokolo said Potwa remained opposed to any sale of Telkom and would fight the drive to privatise Telkom.  &quot;He (Naidoo) cannot do it without the unions,&quot; he said. There were many ways of improving Telkom's equipment and management without bringing in a foreign partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although government and Telkom have stressed they have some way to go before selling a stake in Telkom, the identity of the strategic equity partner has been the subject of much speculation in the merchant banking community. The latest talk is that it is a consortium of Canadian, American, British and French telecommunications companies. A 25% stake would be worth about R7-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo and Sigcau have agreed on the need for separate advisers. The Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Department would also tender for a multidisciplinary team that would include a legal expert, a chartered accountant, a technical expert, an economist specialising in black economic empowerment and &quot;someone with merchant banking experience&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - With the constitutional hurdle out of the way, the markets did not have far to look for yet another reason to punish the rand.  Whether the rationale was the shake-up in the Department of Finance, or the threat by Deputy President FW de Klerk to quit the government, the upshot is renewed pressure on interest rates and concomitant damage to the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've had all these reasons for why the rand is falling -- President (Nelson) Mandela's health, Cosatu strikes, (Chris) Liebenberg's resignation; this is just another one, and De Klerk has made this kind of threat before without causing ructions in the exchange rate. The real difference now is the fundamental reassessment of prospects in South Africa,&quot; says Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This currency crisis calls for a strong response from government. The Constitution has been agreed, but the challenges remain the same -- job creation, job creation, job creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we need is firm direction on policy issues such as privatisation, exchange control, fiscal and monetary policy,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the money market already discounting a one percentage point rise in interest rates, the governor of the Reserve Bank, Dr. Chris Stals, is under pressure to react. He will find no comfort in reserves -- down from R14- billion to R11,7-billion last month. At the end of February, after the first bout of rand- bashing, total reserves stood at a reasonably healthy R14,7-billion. At that stage, the rand was trading at R3,65 to the dollar; at the time of going to press, it had hit R4,49.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While this rate is still better than its all- time low of R4,62, Stals must be seriously considering raising rates again, only two weeks after the last increase. This may help support the rand in the short term, but only to a certain point. The short-term impact has to be weighed against the long-term effect on growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Stals may be reacting too readily to market pressure.  &quot;Saying he was forced into the last interest-rate hike by the money market shortage and at the behest of the banks is very worrying. The same can happen again, with disastrous consequences for the economy,&quot; says Dr Edward Osborne of Edey Rogers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But with the markets this nervous, Stals may have little choice. Says Adam Jacobs of Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa): &quot;We need clarity on the political situation as soon as possible. Either De Klerk must stay in the Government of National Unity or he must quit, but whichever the case, he must say so, now. Otherwise the currency will just come under continued pressure, which we can ill- afford right now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resignation of Dr. Estian Calitz as Director General of Finance may have added to the uncertainty but analysts say the worries are overdone. If anything, this is the perfect opportunity for the new regime to demonstrate a renewed commitment to fiscal reform, and that means keeping a tight rein on the public purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maria Ramos, Calitz's deputy and widely tipped to take over, is seen as very capable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Mohr: &quot;Fiscal policy is unlikely to change; if anything, the markets are reacting to the gradualist approach being taken on the budget deficit, not to expectations of a sudden spending spree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - The Kenyan government has published a 40-page dossier defending its human rights record. The report comes as Kenyan human rights groups grow increasingly vocal about a rise in mob violence and a breakdown of law and order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the report, The Way It Is, the government says its overall record is positive, and blames budgetary restraints for preventing authorities from addressing all human rights issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan human rights groups say the report offers no answers to the growing problem of civil disorder. Incidents of crowds taking the law into their own hands are on the increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost every day the media carry reports of civilians being beaten, necklaced, or hacked to death by mobs seeking vengeance for petty crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government is either unable or unwilling to curb crime in the country,&quot; says director of the Kenyan human rights commission Maina Kiai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When a crime is committed, no action is taken. The police seem unable to move, so the people have decided that the best thing is for they themselves to do something about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Githongo, a columnist in a regional newspaper which has campaigned against mob violence, believes the rulers are to blame. &quot;Human life is cheaper here in Kenya than ever before,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The trouble is that people can't look to any part of our society for moral leadership: if you have a problem, you either bribe your way out of it or you use violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Data collected by the human rights commission reveal that deaths in mob violence far outstrips deaths due to ethnic clashes and banditry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government dismisses its data as &quot;a propagandist catalogue of criminal incidents&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the commission says: &quot;There's a feeling that the government actually accepts mob violence. We've become a society that doesn't care for the weak and the poor. We care much more about property and wealth, and if that's the case, we're a society in big trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - For Israel Ciswaka, his pastor's arrest, torture and dispatch to a Zairean military prison for 12 months' hard labour was confirmation that there is a God after all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He warned us in a sermon that God had told him the army was coming for him, and one hour later what he preached happened. We are joyous to see that the word of God came true,&quot; Ciswaka said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others consider it less than a miracle that the Reverend Fernando Kuthino, pastor of the Army of Victory Church, was jailed by a military tribunal last month for allegedly stockpiling weapons. He was becoming a powerful and controversial voice in the competitive world of Zairean religion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evangelical churches have flourished since Zaire began its laboured transition to democracy in 1990. Crowds are drawn to ministries popping up in garages and abandoned shops. And some are discovering that religion is a good way to make money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The model is America. United States evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, disgraced on home turf after being caught with a prostitute, frequently graces Zairean television screens. The Reverend Pat Robertson, an American who blends fiery preaching and right-wing politics, pays regular visits to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robertson has proven himself a loyal ally of President Mobutu Sese Seko in the US, in return for a free hand to pursue business interests in Zaire, including diamond mining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the new churches are Protestant, encouraged by Mobutu to counter Roman Catholic criticism of his reign. Moonies and Jehovah's Witnesses have found growing audiences, while Baptists and Pentecostals have recently latched on to the pygmy population as a source of recruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even one of Mobutu's most prominent supporters has taken to evangelism with a passion. Honore Ngbanda is popularly known as &quot;The Terminator&quot; because of those said to have died at the hands of the intelligence service he once led. Today he runs a Christian cafe, insists on being called Brother Ngbanda, and regularly appears on television to preach the virtues of strict adherence to biblical teachings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuthino is one of Zaire's best known preachers. He appeared on television each Sunday and launched his own radio station. A photograph on a wall of his Miracle Centre offers a clue to his style. Fitted out in a white stetson, aviator sunglasses and faded denim jacket with his thumbs stuck in his belt, Kuthino looks more like a country music singer than a pastor. But to the envy of his competitors, he proved adept at fund-raising from foreign churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuthino's followers believe that his influence -- and his message -- was his downfall. After a stint with Robertson's Assemblies of God ministry in Virginia, he returned to Zaire six years ago and launched the Army of Victory. It promised everything from a place in heaven to a cure for Aids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its Miracle Centre is packed for services, with throbbing Zairean music carrying way beyond its walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People come here to get healed from Aids and any kind of illness, or just to escape life outside these walls. We give them hope,&quot; said Egide Bompere, one of the ministry's officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Old-style evangelists, such as Jacques Vernand, dismiss the likes of Kuthino as akin to devil-worshippers. &quot;These people are dangerous because Zaireans swallow anything. These preachers are blending fetish worship with Christianity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Army of Victory challenges the traditional view that the downtrodden should accept their lot in this life, in expectation of relief in the next.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We say people do not have to accept hardship, that they do not just have to suffer, that they can fight back against those who make their lives miserable,&quot; Bompere said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kuthino's supporters said he had been warned off sermons encouraging the poor to challenge exploitation and oppression. A banner hangs across the Miracle Centre, reading: &quot;We use all ways and means possible.&quot; But the ministry insists Kuthino encouraged only non-violent resistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February, just before his radio station was to go on air, soldiers burst into the Miracle Centre, claiming to have discovered a weapons cache, and took Kuthino away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We never saw any weapons here. They didn't like his popularity and what he had to say,&quot; Bompere said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Some of Africa's leading journalists said this week a free press was essential to prevent rampant corruption and was the last bastion against the greed of tyrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference, organised by the Institute for the Advancement of Journalism, hosted media executives from several African countries including Kenya, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The journalists said intractable problems in their countries were poverty and graft, and once corruption became part of the culture of society, it was difficult to reverse the trend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Monetary Fund came in for criticism, with several African editors saying the IMF had caused sudden monetarism in countries like Mozambique where the government was unable to deliver almost any social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambican editor Carlos Cardoso said the IMF wanted to impose its rules which often destroyed local industry. African countries should force their rules on the IMF, he said. The IMF's influence had almost wrecked Mozambique's cashew nut industry until local people took the matter into their own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A delegate from Zimbabwe, Andrew Moyse, editor of the independent monthly Horizon, said new alliances between political elites and powerful industrial organisations were now encouraging corruption in Africa where desperate governments were violating basic democratic rights to lure foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan humanities professor, Ali Mazrui, now based in New York, suggested regional integration, based on five geographic areas, should help economic development of the continent. These groups could provide peace- keeping forces more sensibly, rather than individual countries with armies.  He suggested a Southern African force might be better deployed in the Liberian war than those now engaged from Nigeria who were accused of being involved in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's Foreign Affairs deputy director, Abdul Minty, said &quot;Mandela ... and new South Africa factors&quot; were additional burdens to decision-making structures in the government. He was responding to appeals from African journalists to help strengthen the democratic process on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minty said demands on South Africa &quot;sometimes create paralysis in our departments&quot;. He said regional frameworks were needed and the Southern African Development Community was the ideal vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A group of negotiators has finalised the route to achieving equality in education and breaking down apartheid's legacy of unequal funding for different races.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unequal spending will be erased by the year 2000, following an agreement signed by the Education Labour Relations Council, composed of government representatives and major teachers' unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parity will only be achieved by forfeiting the jobs of thousands of teachers across the country, but unions are satisfied that after months of negotiations they have struck the best deal possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994, after consultation with provincial MECs for education, the government drafted a five-year plan to achieve equality in education. In the first financial year -- 1995/96 -- 15 % of the education budget would be shifted from the better-funded provinces, and 20% in the second year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 80% of the state's total budget for education, personnel expenditure takes the largest chunk, and inequalities are immediately manifest in differing teacher- pupil ratios. Budget cuts would unavoidably affect the number of teachers a province can employ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Education Department is emphatic that it does not intend to decrease the number of teachers employed, but instead wants to re- deploy them in areas where they are needed most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their negotiated agreement with the council, the government's rationalisation measures were approved by the major teacher trade unions.  They agreed to a teacher:pupil ratio of 1:35 in secondary schools, and that the 1:40 ratio in primary schools would be extended for another year, to be revised annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first step towards redeploying teachers is an offer of a voluntary severance package to allow those who prefer leaving the service to do so, creating room for excess teachers. Right-sizing committees comprising representatives of the Education Department, school governance committees, staff members and observers from unions will be established to make recommendations about which teachers are in excess. Provincial and national redeployment agencies will be established to compile a data base of excess teachers and facilitate their transfer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council also signed an agreement on salaries, offering an average increase of 15,7% this year and establishing guidelines for increases for the next two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Education Minister Sibusiso Bengu said the agreement represented a high degree of consensus: &quot;We are by now used to both Naptosa (National Professional Teachers' Organisation of South Africa) and Sadtu (South African Democratic Teachers' Union) approaching these negotiations carefully and exacting the maximum advantages for their members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sadtu president Duncan Hindle said the agreement signalled a dramatic shift in the past few weeks, during which the unions had finally got the government to agree there should be no retrenchments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We all had to accept the reality that there were serious inequalities within provinces and between provinces. Achieving equality was our guiding principle in the negotiations,&quot; Hindle said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The severance package being offered was &quot;quite attractive&quot;, he added, although it was not enough to retire on. But the money could be used for training in another field, or to start a business. A teacher graded at post level one, for instance, with 13 years' service, could leave with R18 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We think this will take out the people who are not willing to work in a non-racial democratic education system. If they're not comfortable with the new order, it's best they leave,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agreement offers some protection against the most qualified and committed teachers leaving by allowing the government to approve their severance packages but retain their services for a further 18 months. Unlike other public servants, teachers who accept the package will never be able to work in the public service again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The right-sizing committees will have to take the school's curriculum into account when deciding which teachers are in excess, and then apply the last in, first out rule. So if a mathematics teacher was the last employed at a school, but it has an excess of history teachers, the last history teacher will be the first out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The teachers the committees decide are in excess then face redeployment to another school. They can appeal against transfer to another province if, for instance, their spouses are not able to join them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No teacher's career will be in jeopardy. The normal labour practices will apply,&quot; said Hindle. &quot;Only in the last instance can the state insist a teacher be redeployed, and if that instruction is ignored the teacher can be charged with misconduct and dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is no big stick, this process will take a long time and be handled as sensitively as possible. There will be assistance for those who move. No teacher will be dumped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Teachers' Assocation (Sata), one of the largest unions in the Naposa federation, said it was a &quot;reluctant signatory&quot; to the agreement. &quot;We signed because we know that many of our members are keen to take the package. We are committed to equality in education and the salary increases were attractive,&quot; said Sata president Hugh Killops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the union had reservations about whether the government had the administrative capacity to handle the redeployment of thousands of teachers.  Sata also believed the insistence that teachers who take the package never work for the state again was an unfair labour practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sata is concerned that the redeployment process is too rushed. The agreement stipulates the packages are available from May 1, and that the right-sizing committees be established within 30 days of signing the agreement,&quot; Killops added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the union represents mostly teachers employed in Model C schools, it would like to offer governing bodies the opportunity to raise funds and employ excess teachers at their own expense. But it is unclear how this will be achieved, since legislation on the powers of governing bodies will only be available for public comment in August.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Former British spy Paul Grecian, who spent 135 days in South African prisons, returned to London this week to plan a legal assault on the South African branch of Interpol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wants to launch a string of lawsuits against American and British government institutions, but first in his sights is Interpol whose zeal has saddled him with hefty legal bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grecian says he will investigate suing the South African branch of Interpol, which, he believes, &quot;lured&quot; him to South Africa by telling him there was no warrant out for his arrest when he telephoned from London to check whether it was safe for him to visit the country to see his girlfriend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After being given the all-clear by Interpol director Dave Bruce, Grecian flew to South Africa on December 15 where he was greeted with an Interpol &quot;red alert&quot; arrest warrant, kicking off a five-month stretch in prison with a spell in solitary confinement over Christmas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with the Mail &amp; Guardian this week, Bruce dismissed any suggestion he deliberately trapped Grecian. He says that as he testified in the extradition hearing, he had at first not remembered ever talking to Grecian last year. &quot;I was astounded when he first said he had spoken to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then Bruce said one of his colleagues had reminded him of his telephonic conversation with Grecian in London. Then only did Bruce recall Grecian had in fact asked him whether he was wanted for any crime in South Africa -- not whether there was any Interpol warrant. &quot;I did not ask him why he had got hold of me as head of Interpol... . It is unfair for him how it transpired ... it was an unfortunate mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce, who was previously a senior officer of the South African Police's media relations, said he could quite easily have denied ever having spoken to Grecian as there would have been nobody apart from Grecian to tell otherwise.  &quot;I could have kept quiet about this, but this is not expected from a South African police officer&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grecian began his incarceration at Modderbee Prison east of Johannesburg, but asked for a transfer to Krugersdorp Prison, west of the city after battling to get access to the two phones he shared with 3 500 inmates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A source close to prison officials said disgraced stockbroker Greg Blank helped arrange the transfer, but this could not be confirmed. Blank is serving a seven-year sentence at Krugersdorp Prison where he is understood to have developed an unusually cordial relationship with the prison authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grecian's five-month ordeal in South Africa ended last Thursday when a magistrate quashed an application by the United States for his extradition, finding that the offences he was charged with in America were not crimes under South African law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grecian is wanted in the US on charges of illegal arms-dealing with Iraq and fraud, despite being cleared of similar charges last November by the British Court of Appeal which accepted that he had been acting under orders from the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the arms-dealings, Grecian was able to alert the West of Saddam Hussein's plans to develop a &quot;Super-Gun&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The US never tried to extradite Grecian when he was in Britain and Interpol there never arrested him, despite his high profile appearances in the British courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grecian was naturally wary of leaving Britain with the US charges against him, which was why he contacted Bruce before coming to South Africa to visit his girlfriend, Elizabeth Powell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bruce says Grecian had to be imprisoned in terms of South Africa's extradition agreement with the US. He says the series of unsuccessful extradition hearings which culminated in the rejection of the US extradition order will not affect the way the South African Interpol office conducts itself in future. &quot;We had to act on that red notice. We are part of a judicial process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just because a South African court did not extradite Grecian there is no reason that he cannot be successfully pinned down in another country, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the red alert notice remained in place when Grecian left for London on Tuesday night. At the airport, Grecian said he was confident he would have a smooth arrival at Heathrow. In any case, he said, the British, unlike the South Africans, did not arrest and imprison on the basis of a red notice without a court hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from exploring a law suit against Interpol, he will consider taking legal action against the US for laying charges against him. He suspects the Americans are particularly anxious to get hold of him so he can help give evidence in other arms-dealing prosecutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to friends of Grecian in Johannesburg, he had no trouble at London Heathrow and went straight off for an interview at the House of Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Campaigners in South Africa for his release say both former British prime minister Edward Heath and Lord Richardson, who heads the Labour Party in the House of Lords, have expressed concern about the way in which South Africa handled the affair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa rejoined Interpol in September 1993 after a 27-year exile from the international police network which was set up in 1914 to combat international crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Interpol executive director Dave Bruce says the South African Police Interpol office in Pretoria, which is now staffed by 14 detectives, provides the link between the South African Police (SAP) and police in Interpol's other 175 member countries, all of which are now linked to a central computer database. Interpol handles any crime as long as it is not &quot;political&quot;, he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Growing anti-landmine sentiments in South Africa and abroad have prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to announce a permanent ban on the export of the mines by South Africa, confirming a moratorium which has been in place for the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A suspension has also been placed on the use of mines by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Affairs Deputy Director General Abdul Minty said the decision to suspend the use of mines had been initiated by Foreign Affairs, and the suspension will be in effect until it has been discussed in Cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SANDF is to present a report to Cabinet on the strategic value of landmines to its operations, and on this basis Cabinet will decide whether to make the ban permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is definite, however, is South Africa will no longer export anti-personnel mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has in the past manufactured and exported landmines, but manufacturers and the SANDF have kept tight-lipped about how many mines were made, where they were exported to, and when the manufacture ceased. The SANDF is known to have stockpiles of conventional mines, which it said last year would be replaced by &quot;smart mines&quot; which self-destruct after a set period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African decision came at the end of the United Nations review conference on the Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW), which finished in Geneva last week. In the run-up to the conference which was intended to give additional muscle to the original CCW, South Africa had been criticised for not insisting the CCW be amended in a way which would oblige signatories to place an outright ban on the use, manufacture or transfer of mines in their national territories. Instead, South Africa went along with a position which allowed for conventional mines to be replaced by &quot;smart mines&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The import and export ban adopted by South Africa applies to &quot;smart mines&quot; as well as conventional mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conference, five more countries added their names to the list of states supporting a convention which would impose a complete ban on landmines, bringing to 34 the number of countries favouring this position.  While the position held by South Africa remained the majority one at the conference, the drift of other states towards the total ban position put increasing pressure on South Africa to take a harder line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conference, South Africa did not support the idea that the CCW should require signatories to ban landmines completely, on the grounds that this would dissuade other countries from supporting the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL) has described the UN protocol as &quot;a shameful betrayal of the tens of thousands of innocent civilians who live in mine-affected regions and those of future generations who will fall victim to this inhuman weapon&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ICBL's concerns include the convention's endorsement of smart mines, and the fact that it only restricts devices which are &quot;primarily&quot; intended as antipersonnel mines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The lesson from this week's truth commission hearings in Durban is that the effects of the organisation's work can never be easily predicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of hearing evidence from mainly ANC- aligned victims -- as was widely expected because of an Inkatha boycott -- the commission ended up strengthening its non-partisan image and its prospects of helping to reconcile divided parties in the war-torn province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three important happenings caused this sudden turnabout for the fortunes of the process of truth and reconciliation in KwaZulu-Natal: Magoo Bar bomb victims' demands for ANC-bomber Robert McBride's government post to be withdrawn; requests from Stompie Seipai's mother that Winnie Mandela's role in the murder of her son be more fully investigated; and a dramatic decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party to take part in some of the commission's hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commission chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu hinted strongly at a press conference on Wednesday night that perpetrators of human rights violations should not be rewarded. &quot;We would obviously want to be as consistent as possible with that objective&quot; he said. &quot;We want to promote a culture of human rights which shows respect for victims and does not add to their pain.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu was responding to requests from relatives of Marchelle Gerrard, one of the three people killed in the 1986 bomb attack on the Magoo's Bar in Durban, for McBride to removed from public office. &quot;The fact that we are contributing to his upkeep (as taxpayers) is inconceivable,&quot; was the way one of Gerrard's sisters, Sharon Welgemoed, approached the commission this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu also indicated the commission would adopt a tough line of inquiry in the case of Stompie Seipai, a young ANC activist from Tumahole in the Free State who was killed by members of Winnie Mandela's bodyguard brigade in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to questions about whether the commission's investigative unit would probe Winnie Mandela's apparent role in the murder, Tutu said: &quot;There is no reason why we are not going to look into this with the most rigorous concern ... If we need to subpoena the president we will subpoena the president. No one is above the particular laws the commission has been set up under.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then Ziba Jiyane, general secretary of the Inkatha Freedom Party, seemed to underscore a realisation that the truth commission wasn't simply going to dwell on cases in which people involved in the ANC's struggle against apartheid suffered persecution. He announced this week that the IFP would make use of the commission's ability to recommend compensation for victims of human rights abuse and to grant amnesty to IFP members already convicted of political crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane told the Mail &amp; Guardian, however, that Inkatha would not appear at public hearings of the commission to defend its position because the truth body had &quot;been set up without the consensus of all parties&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutu welcomed the move but responded by saying it was not possible for any party to participate selectively in the commission's processes. He pointed out that all amnesty applications required full disclosure of all human rights violations before they could be considered. Applications for reparations could also, in terms of the law, only be considered after being referred by the amnesty committee or the human rights violations committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No party can avoid public scrutiny once it uses any of the committees of the commission,&quot; said Tutu. &quot;It is in the interests of all parties to tell their side of the story. We are keen to stress we want to tell the whole story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unexpected ability of the commission to bolster its non-partisan image in the wake of this week's hearings in KwaZulu-Natal may just give it a chance to promote a bit of reconciliation. He told the M &amp; G that Inkatha's decision would have important repercussions for the commission's objectives.  &quot;Once victims come to the commission they relate with each other. They begin to see each other as all victims of the same process and that is a beginning for reconciliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Constitution has become a yardstick of the success and strength of the political parties, and will do much to define them in the eyes of the public in the run-up to the 1999 general elections. reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHERE does the Constitutional Assembly leave the African National Congress? &quot;In a league of its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has, during the last two years of constitution-making, negotiated its election promises of April 1994 (and more) through into the final constitutional text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By its conviction and dogged, sometimes ruthless, negotiating style, the ANC has been able to free itself from the worst of the compromises it made in the interim Constitution, defining itself to its voters as the political movement that has not only brought freedom to South Africans, but also entrenched it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's likely that the majority of the population will be impressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of all the constitutional victories the ANC scored, the settlement on centre-provincial relations was the easiest, given that at one stage of constitutional debate, federalism was the most sensitive of all constitutional issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the introduction of the Council of Provinces and the concept of co-operative government, the ANC has put itself firmly in control of both the centre and provincial interests, considerably lessening the powers of maverick provinces run by opposition parties (the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal) to buck the centre, and diminishing the threat of federalism to ANC national control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most dramatic of the ANC victories concerned the &quot;three-pack&quot; of clauses in the Bill of Rights. Over the past two weeks, the National Party stuck fast to positions on labour relations, property and education, hoping to push the ANC to the edge, and thus to an agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marathon all-nighters notwithstanding, the ANC refused to be eye-balled into accepting the NP's desire to entrench, as a constitutional right, the apartheid-derived system of mother- tongue, single-medium, state-subsidised schools, offering the Nats a sop to this instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC also refused, with labour's backing and some say Cosatu's insistence, to put in a lock-out clause in the Labour Relations Bill, thereby seeming to champion the interests of the workers against employers. Further, the ANC formulated the property clause in such a way that it could be claimed as a &quot;tool for land reform&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also chalked in as victory on the score-board is the ANC's refusal to allow the NP to introduce any form of executive power-sharing. The ANC steadfastly refused to recognise traditional leadership in government and continued to insist on gender equality. It has also had success in outlawing racist hate- speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC can also claim credit for being the chief architect of the Local Government chapter, elevating municipal governance to an independent tier of government with a constitutional guaranteed slice of national revenue.  Further, the ANC takes the credit for ensuring that all South Africa's 11 languages have equal standing, replacing the interim Constitution's preference for English and Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a great deal for the ANC to boast about on the eve of local government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is also in the lucky position of being able to boast about the concessions it made, to ensure that other political parties remained on board, thereby giving the text the legitimacy it desperately needs to enshrine it in the hearts of all South Africans, not just in the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By giving the Freedom Front its Cultural Commission and a self-determination principle, by giving the leader of the NP status as the Leader of the Opposition, and by bending to the Democratic Party and lobbyists from left and right on many issues in the Bill of Rights and elsewhere, the ANC showed itself to be just generous-spirited enough not to be type- cast as a bully -- even though it was the largest, most aggressive boy in the playground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the opportunity the CA has given to the party's secretary general, Cyril Ramaphosa, to champion human rights, civil liberties, justice and good government with the most engaging of smiles can only enhance the party's standing in the eyes of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Wednesday was a day for all South Africans to be proud, it must have been a special day of jubilation for ANC leadership because it set the party on the road to the final new South Africa with everything it needs for success and an electoral victory in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does the CA process leave the Inkatha Freedom Party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sore, sulky losers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a sad reflection on Inkatha that only five journalists came to a special four-hour workshop on the evils of the final Constitution held at Parliament this week. Most of them only stayed an hour, refusing more cake and tea, to return to the CA, believing what MP's had to say there was ultimately more relevant to the public at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The general opinion among all constitutional players, from the presidential office to the Pan Africanist Congress, was that Inkatha has marginalised itself by refusing to return to the CA to fight its case for greater provincial autonomy there and that its views would have had an impact on the Constitution had they not left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha theoreticians, and legal advisor Mario Ambrosini, will have their day at the certification of the Constitution at the Constitutional Court, where they will argue that this final draft is in fact unconstitutional because it diminishes provincial power and boosts the power of the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While their argument in this respect has much weight -- the provincial powers have been decreased in comparison to the interim Constitution -- their refusal to participate does not help them, partly because nobody hears their side of the story in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does this leave the NP? &quot;Compromised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They tried so hard to win through opposition, but in the end the NP's greatest art is compromise. An early attempt to further power- sharing in the final Constitution was beaten down by the ANC leaving Deputy President FW de Klerk with nothing more than the title of Leader of the Opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With stated intention of ensuring federalism in the final Constitution, Secretary General Roelf Meyer agreed to a system of co-operative government that would clip the wings of the NP's only premier, Hernus Kriel, in the Council of Provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promising to fight to the last for single- medium, mother-tongue, state-subsidised schools, Meyer agreed to an education clause that makes their objective a possibility, but not a constitutional right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC played the NP carefully from the start, knowing full well that they needed the NP's vote to get the two-thirds majority to pass the Constitution, and that once the NP's support for the text was secured, it would make it harder for the DP and the FF to vote against the text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cultivated relationship between Roelf Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa, and the spontaneous camaraderie that developed between Ramaphosa and NP MP Leon Wessels, and then between a number of NP and ANC stalwarts, helped to move the process along in, it was claimed, &quot;a spirit of give and take&quot;. Much of the NP's success lay in the quieter process of finding common ground with the ANC, a party whose ideology they used to oppose vehemently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP was in the difficult position of having to juggle constituencies -- on the one hand it had its loyalties to the traditional Afrikaner constituency, but it was also trying to court the emerging black bourgeoisie, coloured nationalists in the Western Cape, and big and small business. In the end, the party compromised on the aspirations of all three, but unlike Inkatha, participated gracefully in the final ceremony for the sake of South Africa and a position as opposition and for the common good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement that the NP will pull out of the Government on National Unity, to better fulfil an opposition role, does not come as a surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does this leave the DP?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Optimistic&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's spontaneous applause for DP leader Tony Leon during his earnest speech at the adoption ceremony on Wednesday took some by surprise.  The aggression and fearlessness with which the DP took on the ANC directly during the Constitution-making process did not endear him to either ANC leaders or back-benchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The party locked horns frequently with the ANC, particularly over the Bill of Rights, on the issues of property, civil liberties, equality, labour relations, federalism and checks and balances on government leaders, wanting ultimately to secure greater freedom for individuals and the market, and wanting to check the power of central government and politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the final instance, it did not win all its battles; it lost many of the big ones, but it refused to compromise on its principles, defining it as a stauncher opposition to the ANC than the NP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the NP is still coming to terms with its loss of political power -- now finally confirmed by the new constitutional text -- the DP is resigned to having more influence than power, and by living by wit and stamina rather than popularity. It is difficult to pinpoint all the instances in which DP arguments have impacted on the final draft, but their accumulative effect is great, given their size and their past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DP kept the world guessing to the last moment, whether it would support the final draft -- of which so much was decided by the ANC and the NP -- but, in the end, Leon confirmed the party's support, optimistic that it would act as a &quot;shield behind which ordinary South Africans can be secured in the fastness of their rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the optimism is underscored by a wariness that the way to hell can be paved by good intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does this leave the FF?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sustained, but abstaining.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FF's decision not to vote one way or the other on the final Constitution surprised many ANC MPs, if their cries of dismay at the final adoption ceremony were anything to go by, because the ANC believed it had given &quot;the General&quot; -- FF leader Constand Viljoen -- what he wanted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many respects they had. The FF say they are satisfied that the Constitution acknowledges collective rights, self-determination and creates a commission that will protect the cultural and other rights of minorities.  They are also pleased that the introduction of the final Constitution will not end the life of the Volkstaat Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the FF believes that the agreement on the education clause, which does not entrench Afrikaner single-medium schools, was too much of a compromise for them to accept, and with their constituency in mind, they decided they could not vote for the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FF negotiator Corne Mulder said that he had been receiving telephone calls of support for their position, and that their principled stand on education had shown up the NP's weak compromise on education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout this process, the FF has steadfastly stuck to its ground, but it has not taken the opportunity to expand its political horizons and fight for anybody else but white Afrikaners. FF sources said when the deals came through &quot;we are in exactly the same position as we were when the interim Constitution was finalised&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the Pan Africanist Congress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Amused.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAC leader Clarence Makwetu cracked joke after joke at the adoption ceremony, announcing the PAC's support for the text although it departed from many of the party's principles. He said he was particularly pleased that it ended power-sharing, but was disappointed that the GNU would continue until 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally the African Christian Democratic Party?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Still a believer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that the process is over, it is quite safe to say that nobody took the ACDP seriously, except for the CA administration which noted all the remarks its representatives made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ACDP's point of departure was that the Bible overrode the provisions of any Constitution, as does God's will. It voted against the adoption of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Sly to the last, the National Party attempted to win constitutional guarantees for special pensions for long-serving parliamentarians, just before the end of the constitutional negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was with some surprise that the waiting hordes of journalists heard, in the last nail- biting night, that the NP had added a new proposal on the table for discussion, along with the property, labour relations and education clauses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the latter three were matters of principle, this new one was a matter of pocket. During the multi-party negotiations in Kempton Park, the NP MPs negotiated constitutional guarantees for pensions for those who had served in the old apartheid Parliament, and to balance it out, those who had served the ANC in Umkhonto weSizwe. In effect, the guarantee means that many Nat MPs who served in the last Parliament and are in the new one are receiving double pay -- a pension for apartheid days service as well as their current salary package. The NP wanted a guarantee in the final Constitution that this double privilege would not be taken away, once the interim Constitution fell away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nats were hoping that by introducing this proposal so late, and with everyone so desperate for agreement, the ANC would concede their wish to avoid a deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC sources said that they called the Nats' bluff on that Tuesday night, challenging them to force a deadlock on a matter of pensions, and to take the consequences. At that stage, the NP took the proposal off the table, knowing that the adoption of the Constitution would overshadow this small incident, and that it was unlikely to make headline news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You're right, it doesn't look good,&quot; said an NP source late Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The Mandela-De Klerk era ended at noon on Thursday. The National Party announced it is to quit the Government of National Unity, ending its 48-year stretch in the executive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National Party leader FW de Klerk said yesterday the decision to quit the GNU did not mean an end to good co-operation, but it has left President Nelson Mandela faced with finding six Cabinet ministers and three deputies by June 30, when the withdrawal takes effect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the party's federal executive committee Thursday morning and later endorsed by the NP's parliamentary caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision was due to have been taken at a meeting of the NP's federal council this coming Tuesday. Instead, as the rand went spiraling downwards in the wake of De Klerk's remarks during the adoption of the new Constitution on Wednesday that the NP was seriously considering withdrawing from the GNU, provincial leaders were urgently summoned to Cape Town for yesterday's meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, on a walkabout in Mitchell's Plain, was informed of the decision by De Klerk by phone shortly before the NP leader faced the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk said Mandela's reaction was &quot;cool&quot;; he took notes and &quot;did not try to discuss the merits with me&quot;. De Klerk thanked Mandela for the &quot;good working relationship we could have enjoyed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Party insiders said De Klerk had made up his mind some time ago that he wanted to quit the GNU but faced opposition from within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind De Klerk's thinking lay the realisation that the new Constitution marked a fresh phase in politics and a strategically opportune moment to quit the GNU, rather than wait for its formal expiry in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would allow the party to focus on being an effective opposition without the hindrance of being party to decisions at executive level. It would also smooth internal rifts over the NP's lack of opposition profile and continued participation in the GNU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposing view -- held by party secretary general Roelf Meyer, was that it would be better to make the most of the last few years of power -- sharing and remain an influence in government. De Klerk was understood to be keen to take a quick decision and put an end to uncertainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Debate within the party over the issue came to a head this week as it faced up to voting in favour of a Constitution which it felt to be flawed. It was time for the debate to come out into the open. Being the junior partner in government and an effective opposition is very difficult. Now we are in a transitional moment it is the time to do this, a NP source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provincial leadership will be allowed to make their own decision with regard to staying in or pulling out and the timing of whatever they decide.  It is likely Gauteng will opt to stay in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Town - South African President Nelson Mandela says the country's new constitution's signals a historic step beyond the interim arrangements which legally obliged the nation's representatives to work together across the racial and political divide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the constitutional assembly, Mr. Mandela said the new constitution obliged government to strive to improve the quality of life of South Africans and to promote the development of independent civil society structures. He said the South African nation had affirmed today in no uncertain terms that it was mature enough to derive strength, trust and unity from its tapestry of language, religious and cultural attributes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Mandela said the government was extremely proud that the new constitution asserted equality among South Africa's languages; and that, for the first time the languages particularly of the Khoi, Nama and San communities would receive the attention they deserved after years of being trampled upon in the most humiliating and degrading manner. He also said many new provisions on gender issues reflected the progress made towards securing equality for women who had suffered too many deprivations because of their gender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution was adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on Wednesday by 421 votes to two, with ten abstentions. The African National Congress, the National Party, the Democratic Party and the Pan Africanist Congress voted in favour of it, the African Christian Democratic Party against it, while the Freedom Front abstained. The Senate had to vote separately on aspects of the constitution affecting the provinces. Here the vote was 79 for and none against, while three Freedom Front Senators abstained. The vote count excluded those of the Inkatha Freedom Party of South Africa, which withdrew from the Constitutional Assembly last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agreement on three issues that threatened to delay the adoption of South Africa's new constitution was announced at eleven o'clock on Tuesday night, after last-minute talks on the outstanding issues. The negotiators said the agreement on the education issue included a compromise clause stipulating that single-medium institutions were an alternative that could be taken into account by the state. Agreement was also reached on the lockout and property rights clauses. The National Party attempted a late-night amendment on a new point, asking that pensions be guaranteed in the constitution. However, this was rejected by the African National Congress and did not stand in the way of the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Pan Africanist Congress and the Freedom Front reserved their positions on the education clause. The Democratic Party said that it intended to approach the Constitutional Court because a clause permitting employers to lock out striking workers was not in the constitution. The National Party has reserved its position on this clause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After more than a week of deadlocked talks, the ANC and National Party finally agreed on a new constitution -- just a few minutes past midnight last night. The agreement means that the new constitution is now certain to be voted into law in parliament this morning, ruling out the need for an emergency referendum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the debate in the final week was about allaying white fears. On the three major areas of disagreement, compromise has been reached largely by avoiding the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first sticking point was single-medium schooling, which the National Party insisted upon and the ANC opposed. The compromise education clause says that single medium schooling is one of the alternatives the state must consider in determining education policy &quot;where this is practical&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second sticking point was the &quot;lock-out&quot; clause, in which the ANC sided with Cosatu in arguing that employers did not have the right to lock striking employees out of plants. The compromise avoids the issue by referring to existing labour legislation and calling for consultation on any further changes with both union and employer organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the third issue, property rights, the state has the limited right to land reform, except where mineral rights -- the major area of disagreement --- are involved. Private property rights are now enshrined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Democratic Party has objected to the compromise clauses, particularly the lock-out clause, which leader Tony Leon described as &quot;a victory for Cosatu&quot;. The Inkatha Freedom Party has boycotted the entire constitutional negotiations, and is unlikely to vote in favour. The Pan Africanist Congress is unhappy with the compromise education clause, but is likely to vote in favour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - Following is the text of a statement by Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for African Affairs Vincent D. Kern before the<BR>Subcommittee on Africa in the U.S. House of Representatives on May 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to talk briefly about the crisis in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We find the current situation in Liberia very disturbing. Sporadic gunfire continues to be heard in the capital and thousands of Liberians have fled or are trying to escape the fighting in Liberia. Last Monday, fighters loyal to Charles Taylor again skirmished with fighters of Roosevelt Johnson near the U.S. Embassy compound. Several rounds, apparently directed, hit the perimeter of the embassy. Some U.S. Marines, whose total is about 200 on the embassy compound, fired back in self-defense; no injuries resulted from the incoming rounds or those fired by the Marines.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three earlier incidents involving U.S. Marines at the embassy compound occurred on the afternoon and evening of April 30. In the first incident a Marine was slightly injured when a bullet grazed his neck (he has since returned to duty). In the second and third incidents the Marines returned fire at groups of armed fighters, killing five attackers and wounding a sixth. A Marine was slightly injured in the cheek from flying wood splinters when rounds hit a plywood cover (he too has returned to duty); no injuries resulted from the third incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. forces operating in Liberia are under the general rules of engagement (ROE) for all U.S. forces deployed to a potentially hostile area.  Those ROE include the right of self-defense including preemptive actions to ensure safety should someone show hostile intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), consisting of three U.S. Navy vessels and a logistics ship, continues to operate off the coast of Liberia, approximately 25 miles offshore. There are some 2,200 Marines and 1,100 sailors associated with those ships. The ARG's normal rotation schedule would bring it back to the U.S. beginning mid-July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. troops currently in Monrovia and off the coast are there to reinforce the security of the embassy and to carry out the in extremis evacuation of American citizens. The U.S. has no intention of using our troops to stabilize the city or to perform other military functions off the immediate U.S. Embassy compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Assistant Secretary Moose testified, U.S. forces have successfully evacuated over 2,300 people from Monrovia, 461 of whom are American citizens.  We continue to evacuate Americans and selected third-country nationals as they arrive at the embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total cost for Operation Assured Response is not available at this time. Under a memorandum of understanding between the Department of Defense and the Department of State, the Department of Defense is collecting costs related to Liberia's Noncombatant Evacuation Operation (NEO). Additionally, SECDEF (the secretary of defense) has approved non-DOD, space-available travel via regularly scheduled milair (military air) between Freetown, Sierra Leone, (and) Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. has a long and proud history of humanitarian assistance to those in need. DOD possesses a unique capability for providing critical, specific assets while working as part of a U.S.-coordinated interagency and international effort. During FY 95, the DOD Office of Humanitarian and Refugee Affairs, in support of NGOs and PVOs, shipped 320 tons of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and supplies, and school supplies to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pending your questions, I thank you.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Washington - Following is an excerpt provided by the United States Information Agency of a statement as prepared for delivery by Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), who chairs the subcommittee on Africa in the U.S. House of Representatives, on May 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today the Subcommittee meets to address the crisis in Liberia -- an issue that affects the U.S. and all of us at many different levels, with humanitarian, political, and security concerns clamoring for an immediate end to the killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The breakdown of law and order in Liberia, the loss of innocent lives, the massive destruction that has taken place in Monrovia over the course of the past several weeks, are cause for grave concern for the U.S., the African continent, and for the international community. It is a situation that strikes at the very fiber of human compassion, as thousands are threatened and displaced by the increased hostilities. It is a situation reminiscent of other recent conflicts with the potential to become a humanitarian cataclysm, spilling over into neighboring countries and destabilizing the entire region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the crisis in Liberia is indicative of a far greater problem, a disease that is slowly infecting countries in Africa, creating an environment of conflict and turmoil -- this is, the contradiction between the goals of the people of these African countries, and the personal interests and recalcitrant behavior of political and rebel leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been emphasized many times during the course of hearings held by this Subcommittee, but it must be mentioned again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people of Liberia desperately want peace; yet it is the faction leaders who repeatedly choose to pursue their political objectives through violent means with a total disregard for the suffering inflicted on their fellow Liberians. The people of Liberia want a cease-fire and a return to normalcy. The people of Liberia want to see their country flourish once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While certain problems created by the war will be difficult to surpass, it is clear that Liberia's economic future holds much potential if the war ends soon and political stability takes a firm hold. Specifically to U.S.  interests, many believe that Liberia could once again become an important strategic, diplomatic, and economic partner to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, none of this will be possible until rebel leaders set aside their appetite for power and place the well-being of their country above their personal desires. The time is now for rebel leaders to return to negotiations and end the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. and the international community are ready and willing to help, but only if there is a demonstrable commitment to the peace process and to a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside actors cannot secure a future of peace and prosperity to Liberia. They cannot build a sense of national unity until the feuding leaders demonstrate that they are ready for peace themselves. The U.S. and the international community can ameliorate the pain and suffering that are the effects of the fighting, but only the rebel leaders can end the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. has long worked toward an end to the bloodshed and a reconciliation that will allow all the people of Liberia to live in peace.  Throughout, we have been filled with optimism that this goal would be achieved but, after 13 peace agreements implemented and then broken, our hopes have quickly turned to disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, however, we are once again filled with expectations as an ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) summit is taking place in Accra, Ghana, with certain rebel leaders and representatives of the various factions. This could be the crucial turning point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is certainly what we are all hoping for.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington - Following is the text of a statement, as prepared for delivery, by the U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, George Moose, before the Subcommittee on Africa of the House of Representatives<BR> Good afternoon. I appear before you today at one of the bleakest moments in Liberia's history. Monrovia, once a safe haven for more than one million civilians, lies in ruins, the result of fierce fighting by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and Alhaji Kromah's United Liberation Movement for Democracy (ULIMO-K) rebels against Roosevelt Johnson's breakaway faction of ULIMO (ULIMO-J, comprised primarily of ethnic Krahns). More than 80,000 Liberians have been left homeless. Thousands have fled or are trying to flee the fighting in the capital. At least 100 peacekeepers have lost their lives attempting to restore security in the city and its environs. At this point we do not know how many Liberian fighters and civilians have been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.S. airlift has evacuated more than 2,300 people from Monrovia, including 461 American citizens. The U.S. Embassy staff has been drawn down to 22 official Americans. All of the United Nations agencies, international organizations and non-governmental organizations compounds have been looted and their staffs forced to leave the country. In just three weeks the fighters, many of whom are child soldiers, have caused an estimated $40 million in damages, including $20 million in equipment and supplies lost by relief organizations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I want to take a moment to commend Ambassador William Milam and his staff at the embassy in Monrovia, and the Department of Defense's task force for successfully carrying out the evacuation under very difficult circumstances. The task force was remarkably effective in getting the assets necessary for an effective evacuation in place in the region on very short notice. I also want to commend Ambassador Milam and his courageous staff for immediately stepping in to help deliver food, water, and medical supplies to the homeless and displaced after almost all NGOs were forced to leave. Since April 10, the U.S. Embassy and World Food Program have delivered nearly 2,000 metric tons of food in Monrovia and surrounding areas, thereby averting a humanitarian disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abuja Accord: What Went Wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of the Liberian warring factions signed the Abuja Accord on August 19, 1995. Although it was one in a long series of Liberian peace accords which have attempted to resolve the civil conflict begun in 1989, it held such promise. Charles Taylor and the Nigerians had resolved their differences and were on board, the faction leaders were beginning to work together on the Council of State to implement the accord's disarmament provisions, and the ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) countries were committed to the peace process. What went wrong?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First and foremost, we now know faction leaders did not wholeheartedly commit themselves to the peace process but apparently pursued multiple strategies -- one for peace, the other for war. While pursuing a political solution as members of the new Council of State in Monrovia, they continued their high-stakes warfare in the countryside for control and exploitation of Liberia's rich resources -- timber, diamonds, gold, and rubber. In the meantime, faction leaders hid large caches of arms and munitions in Monrovia and brought hundreds of their armed fighters into the city as &quot;bodyguards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The West African peacekeepers (ECOMOG), who have been in Liberia since 1990 and are largely supported by troop-contributing countries, are responsible for providing security for Liberia and accomplishing the encampment and disarmament of combatants. ECOMOG troop size, which was around 10-12,000 when it successfully defended Monrovia in 1990 and 1992 from attacks and fended off a coup attempt by a Krahn general in September 1994, has been substantially reduced to about 5-6,000 troops. Some of the unpaid ECOMOG troops have gone into business for themselves. In December, ECOMOG troops were attacked and defeated by ULIMO-J rebels at Tubmanburg. ECOMOG suffered heavy casualties (as many as 60 soldiers may have been killed), lost much of its heavy equipment, and suffered a terrible blow to its morale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another significant factor was that overall support for the peace process, including support for ECOMOG, was slow in coming and has not been at the level we had hoped would be committed. At the October 27 U.N. Donors Conference, we pledged $75 million dollars for the peace process, including $10 million for logistical support (leased trucks and helicopters) for ECOMOG. Other potential donors were leary of committing significant resources up-front given the failure of 12 previous peace accords. Still other donors had prohibitions on assistance to non-U.N. peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What We Are Doing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We consider the Abuja Accord -- an interim government, disarmament, demobilization, and the holding of free and fair elections -- the best framework for a permanent solution. Despite its current difficulties, we believe ECOMOG can again become an effective peacekeeping force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have strongly condemned the recent outbreak of fighting -- both in private conversations with faction leaders and in public statements -- and urged all the factions to restore the cease-fire, withdraw their fighters and weapons from Monrovia, and return to the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 21 we dispatched a high-level diplomatic team comprised of representatives from the State Department, National Security Council, and the Joint Staff to work with Ambassador Milam and an ECOWAS delegation sent by Ghanaian President Rawlings to put the peace process back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have also initiated an International Contact Group on Liberia (ICGL), which held its first meeting in Geneva April 26. The focus of the Contact Group's discussions was on how the international community could respond to recent developments in Liberia in a way which could positively influence the peace process. Representatives of 12 nations attended the first meeting; I was heartened by their commitment to continue to work for the cause of peace in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Geneva I went to Accra, where I consulted with President Rawlings on how to get the peace process back on track. On April 30 I went to Monrovia to urge faction leaders to pursue their political objectives through negotiation, not force. Due to the fighting and uncertainty of the security situation I was unable to leave the embassy compound. Although I did speak with Roosevelt Johnson, I was unable to reach Charles Taylor or Alhaji Kromah despite repeated efforts. They thereby missed an opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On May 3, in response to renewed fighting in blatant disregard of the April 19 cease-fire, we announced the reimposition of visa restrictions barring entry into the United States of Liberians, their families, close associates, and others who obstruct the peace process. We are asking other members of the international community to implement a similar travel ban. We are also prepared to consider other measures to demonstrate our intolerance of the faction leaders' obstruction of the peace process. We have told faction leaders that we will not recognize any government coming to power by force and we will actively work with the international community to isolate, ostracize, and reject, both politically and economically, any leader who comes to power by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next Steps</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge that confronts the United States and other friends and supporters of Liberia is to give the Abuja peace process another chance to succeed. The situation in Monrovia must be stabilized. Fighters must withdraw from the capital and Monrovia must once again become a safe haven. Faction leaders must agree to abandon violence in favor of a political process for settling differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will continue our vigorous support for ECOWAS' efforts to achieve a negotiated solution to the current crisis and to reaffirm a peace process which encompasses disarmament, demobilization, and the holding of free and fair democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we speak, Special Presidential Envoy for Liberia Ambassador Dane Smith is representing the United States at a special ECOWAS emergency summit meeting in Accra to which all members of the Liberian Council of State have been invited. This meeting is a critical step in putting the peace process back on track. We hope the Accra summit will reaffirm the Abuja Accord as the best framework for settlement of the Liberian crisis, that ECOWAS countries will commit to applying even greater pressure on the factions to respect the peace process and that there will be serious discussion of bolstering ECOMOG's peacekeeping capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ending arms flows into Liberia remains critical to halting the current fighting. We are pressing for tougher enforcement of the 1992 U.N. arms embargo and are asking other countries to join us in this effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are also looking at ways to increase our support for ECOMOG. If ECOMOG can demonstrate a renewed capacity to play a neutral and effective peacekeeping role, we would be prepared to make available approximately $30 million from existing resources in equipment and other additional assistance.  Although some ECOMOG troops failed to do their duty during the recent fighting and may have participated in the looting, others performed commendably. I want to note again that more than 100 ECOMOG soldiers have died in the past three weeks in Liberia defending the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In conclusion, Madam Chairman, for moral, humanitarian, and political reasons, we choose to remain deeply engaged, even though we realize just how formidable the challenges have become. I want to stress the high priority this administration places on returning Liberia to civilian, democratic rule.  The people of Liberia have suffered too long from this tragic conflict. The time for peace has come. I want to thank you and other members of your subcommittee for your support for peace and democracy in Liberia and throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia is an example of the risks and hardships faced by our people in the field every day as they seek to advance U.S. interests and protect American citizens. These are among the major issues at stake in the foreign affairs budget. If we are going to continue to be a leader in world affairs, we need the resources necessary to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa - Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin announced here that the activities carried out by his ministry over the past eight months and the corresponding results have significantly changed the image of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an explanation he gave to the regular meeting of the House of Peoples' Representatives Tuesday. Ato Seyoum said Ethiopia today is not a token of starvation, war and human sufferings but symbol of peace and stability, economic co-operation and mutual assistance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia has a strong desire for good neighbourliness but this desire has to be supported by the parties in question if it is to bear fruit, the minister said, adding its relations are seriously being affected by the policy of international terrorism pursued by the government in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Except with the Sudan, Ethiopia's relations with the rest of its neighbours have been successful, Ato Seyoum said and cited the principles of mutual respect, the respect for the sovereignty of nations and non interference in the internal affairs of others as the basis of the foreign relations policy of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said, Ethiopia has forged good relations with southern Africa and the Magreb countries such as Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, the Republic of South Africa, Algeria and Tunisia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the country has consolidated friendly ties and good relations with European, North American and Asian countries, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the foreign minister, efforts to improve relations with the Middle East and Gulf countries have not brought about the anticipated results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ato Seyoum said it is the oldest of all similar ministers in Africa but paradoxically enough has very few qualified staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said efforts have been made to gradually solve the problem of skilled man power and impeding structure through successive measures taken immediately after the transitional government assumed power in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister has responded to questions on Ethiopia's foreign relations posed by members of the House of Peoples' Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting has also approved with some minor amendments the proclamation providing for the establishment of the defence force of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - More than 180 traditional and contemporary hats, headdresses and headties from throughout Africa are featured in the exhibition &quot;Crowning Achievements: African Arts of Dressing the Head,&quot; opening May 8 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art, 950 Independence Ave. S.W.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On view through August 18 the exhibition was organized by the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History. From Washington &quot;Crowning Achievements travels to the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College (September 21 to December 1) and to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta (April 22, 1997 to June 15, 1997)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Composed of an array of forms and an enormous range of materials, the objects in the exhibition represent a cross-cultural survey of Africa's dynamic arts of personal adornment. The works -- dating from the early 1800s to present -- examine the significance of headwear across Africa as well as in the African Diaspora. In addition to works from the Fowler Museum, &quot;Crowning Achievements&quot; includes objects from the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African Art, the Museum of International Folk Art (Santa Fe) and from private collections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These works of art illustrate how people use hats to construct social identities and to enhance and transform their lives,&quot; said Mary Jo Arnoldi, National History curator of African ethnology and art. Arnoldi and Christine Mullen Kreamer, a museum exhibit developer, served as guest curators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, as in many cultures, hats and hair define social status, age or gender and transmit important messages about the attitudes, values and beliefs that shape the human experience. &quot;Crowning Achievements&quot;, interpreting African headwear with an emphasis on individual identity, explores the material artistry, spiritual value, historical origins and stylistic influences of the objects. Related clothing, African hairdressing signs and photographs augment the presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The National Museum of African Art is delighted to host this rich and celebratory exhibition and to have participated by providing photographs from the Eliot Elisofon Photographic Archives to both the exhibition and the accompanying catalog,&quot; said Phillip Ravenhill, chief curator at the museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following and introductory section, the exhibition offers an in-depth view of 12 provocative hats, including a Yoruba beaded crown, a Gola fiber hat, a Sudanese chain-mail helmet, an Ethiopian silver crown and a Herero woman's leather headdress. They represent a wide geographic range of cultural styles which employ a diversity of materials and exhibit technical expertise.  The curators have provided information on the cultures that produced the hats as well as the techniques of construction, the symbolic importance of materials and forms chosen by the hat makers. How the hats came into the collection is also explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like hats, hairstyles are excellent vehicles for visual expression.  Another section features elaborate wigs, hairpieces, hairpins combs and headrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A section on everyday and special hats features informal or everyday hats and special-occasion wear. Aesthetically and regionally diverse, these hats illustrate issues of style and symbolism, purpose and personal choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though often beautiful in form and technique, everyday wear tends to be made of durable, inexpensive material. Some of these hats are from calabashes incised with curvilinear designs and others derived from reeds, grasses and tree fibers are transformed into wearable art. The creation of headwear for special occasions, in contrast, involves the use of precious or exotic materials, and the result displays a high degree of decorative embellishment that conveys power, wealth and prestige. Whether intended for kings, brides or diviners, these hats may fulfill a multitude of functions. For example, such special headwear as the exuberantly beaded bicorn Pende chief's headdress can serve as a visual metaphor for political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sculptural art of wrapping the head -- featuring men's and women's headties and turbans that highlight the elegant expressions of this widespread custom in Africa -- is presented in a slide show in this section of the exhibit. Highlighted are headwrapping traditions among Tuareg and Hausa men and among Yoruba women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Headwear serves as an important material symbol of rank and title.  Issues of status are investigated in the next segment of the exhibition, which compares the full range of headgear used by two societies in Zaire -- the Kuba and the Lega.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final part of the exhibition looks at the significant impact African styles have on international style as it traces contemporary trans-Atlantic connections between Africa and America. Today, hats made of, or inspired by, Ghanaian kente cloth or Bamana mud-cloth from Mali and the Islamic-style cloth skullcaps have hit the urban fashion scene outside the continent. A selection of hats from Los Angeles' African marketplace offers an excellent case study of the range of African-influenced headwear available for sale in major American cities. The hats evoke ties to Egypt, African Islam and Jamaican Rastafarianism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to two free gallery hand-outs, the museum is offering a series of exhibition-related activities this spring and summer including lectures, workshops and children's programs. For a free schedule, call (202) 357-4600 ext. 291.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 185 page illustrated exhibition catalog, which sells for $45 in hardback or $27 in paperback, is available in the museum shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Museum of Art is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is free. The museum's TTY number is (202) 357-4814. The Smithsonian Home Page on the World Wide Web (http://www.si.edu) includes information on the museum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Zambian Journalists today made a show of strength and reaffirmed their belief in a free press when they came together to commemorate World Freedom Day - which is set aside for writers by the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various speakers assured media persons that they were with them all the way but that they themselves as practitioners should show the way by giving committment to the cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) told them it believes freedom to information should not be a privilege of the few, but a right of every Zambian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It reaffirmed its support for those who fought for their basic freedom adding that it has not departed from what it did in 1991 when they supported MMD for just governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at Freedom Statue to commemorate World Freedom Day, which falls today, ZCTU Vice-President, Austin Liato, urged journalists to unite and guard against government's pressure to try and make them its mouth-piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You have in the past been used as government's tools for its propaganda. The time has come for you to unite and reject such a pressure,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at the same ceremony, Media Institute for Southern Africa (MISA) Governor in Zambia, Fanwell Chembo, said despite government being a signatory to the world free press declaration of 1991 signed in Namibia, it has continued to bulldoze the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a solidality message to mark the occassion, Zambia Information Services (ZIS) Director, Patrick Jabani, said in a multi-party democracy, the press should carry non-partisan civic education campaigns and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a message read on his behalf by ZIS acting Newspapers Manager, Davis Mukuka, Jabani said his department will strive to keep up to date with people's views, concerns and efforts to meet their obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) urged government to fully implement media reforms and attract private investment in the profession to enable the media flourish extensively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commemorating the media World Freedom Day President, Alfred Zulu said true democracy could only be attained when the press had autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The full attainment of a democratic society can only have its true meaning when the press has autonomy as a free establishment&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu, therefore, called on all governments in Southern Africa to privatise and integrate the media in the democratisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said such integration would facilitate the rapid emergence of rapid pluralist society, protect human rights and use political pluralism as a major tool in resolving conflicts within and between nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu charged it should be noted that press freedom has necessarily been recognised as a bill of human rights by the United Nations, the Commonwealth, European Union and the Organisation of African Unity and the Organisation of American States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urged celebrating journalists to keep in mind about their numerous colleagues through out the world who were tortured, killed and persecuted for their support of democracy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The big meeting which was planned for today for all leaders of political parties in Zambia failed to take place after some opposition heads tried to impose 'impossible pre-conditions' for their attendance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Frederick Chiluba, afterwards, told a State House press briefing that the unravelling of the big 'indaba' had been engineered by some leaders of opposition political parties who wanted to sneak in the much talked about constituent assembly via the back door by first creating a semblance of a political crisis in the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba said his government fully regretted the flop of the meeting but that it will not sit idly by while some opposition parties tried to usurp power through the use of unconstitutional means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''In spite of what happened this morning my government shall continue to dialogue with the various interest groups in the nation including opposition political parties,'' Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President did not single out any political party for special blame but he was catergorical enough that opposition parties have squandered chance of dialogue adding that he left the whole sordid affair to the nation which shall best judge who is to blame.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Chiluba reminded the nation that ever since his government came into office it had left doors wide open for frank and intimate discussions with other political parties and that was why it had been found necessary to include opposition political leaders on government business trips so they could help keep lines of communication ever open between government and opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, some opposition parties had taken this to be a sign of weakness and that was why under the guise of pre-conditions, they had now wanted to forment a crisis which would have called into questionthe legality of a bona fide and legitimate government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''I am happy to report that the crisis which was about to be formented by opposition parties has failed and we remain firmly in control of the situation and hope to advance the agenda of running the nation,'' Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alluding to the biggest reason for the none-holding of the inter-party meeting earlier today, Mr Chiluba explained that there was no way in which his government could abdicate its responsibility over chairmanship because it still legitimately enjoys the support of most Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He explained that there was no parallel between what happened in 1991 when a neutral chairman had to be called in, to replace Dr Kaunda, at an inter-party meeting held in Lusaka because the UNIP government at that time had lost legitimacy and the very support of the people as this was later underscored by the election result which followed those talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Movement for Multi-Party Democracy, therefore, cannot be compared to the UNIP Government of 1991 because it was legitimately put into office by the majority of Zambians who up to today are still very much in support of its policies and programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, then, it would be wrong for opposition leaders to twist the hand of government for a concession which they did not deserve, Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Presidents of opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) and Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) on Sunday attached a pre-condition for their attending the inter-party meeting and this was that the 'indaba' should be chaired by a neutral person from either the judiciary or clergy and not President Chiluba because he is an interested party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this pre-condition was outrightly rejected by Government which felt it would be setting a very bad precedent and indirectly give away what rightfully belongs to it and not opposition parties for the sake of accomodating opposing views.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The long awaited K10,000, K5,000 and K1,000 bank notes will soon be in circulation, Bank of Zambia announced in Lusaka today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing a press briefing, Bank of Zambia Governor, Dr Jacob Mwanza, said the initial consignment would be introduced on the market in two weeks time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however, added that the full impact of the circulation would be felt next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He advised the public to closely examine the features of the new bank notes, which will be displayed on posters, to avoid being cheated with forged notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The distinguishing features are that the colour of the African fish eagle on the K10,000 is blue; purple and maroon on the K5,000 and K1,000 notes respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mwanza said higher denominations of money would reduce the public's risks of carrying big bundles of money which can easily be identified by thieves. He added that it will also save time when effecting transactions at banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The total cost in both printing and freight costs amounted to 857,600 British pounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mwanza ruled out the possibility that the introduction of the high denominations would spark inflation in the country, saying inflation could only be sparked if there was an excess supply of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said as lower denominations of money go back to the Central Bank, higher denominations would merely be replacing them in circulation and hence, there would be no increase in money supply and velocity which facilitate inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr Mwanza added that lower denominations such as K20, and K50, notes would eventually be phased out and replaced with coins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was costly to continue printing lower denomination notes, saying it was better to print coins instead which are not printed as frequently as notes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to public relations officer, Captain Gabriel Kunda who is also the field spokesman said the exercise of delivering the relief maize will start tomorrow Tuesday and it will take 10 days to finish the operation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Captain Kunda said Zambezi has favourable weather and no big mountains to disrupt the operation adding that the 10-days will be sufficient to deliver the 525 by 50kg bags of yellow maize unless there would be unseen circumstances to interupt them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the relief maize will be airlifted to Zambezi west where hunger has hit most of the areas of Kayenge, Mwange, Nguyuvu, Mufula, Nachikayi, Muzwiza, Milomboi, Matondo and Muyembe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Programme Against Malunutrition chairman, David Crowdac, said people from the west bank were starving as their food stocks had run out some months ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Commonwealth Boxing Council (CBC) two weeks ago ordered Ryan to fight Bwalya, Zambia's light-welterweight champion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All this time, Ryan has been avoiding to fight Bwalya,&quot; Yusuf Seedat, Bwalya's handler, said in an interview on Saturday. &quot;It is good that finally, the CBC has mandated him to fight Bwalya, Ryan will now see who the real champion is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the fight has to be delayed for at least another month as Ryan's licence has been suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ryan is mandated to defend against Bwalya. In view of the temporary suspension of his licence for medical reasons by the British Boxing Board, an extension is being granted to Ryan and the position will be reviewed again within about a month of today's date,&quot; reads CBC's letter of April 18 to Seedat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The kwacha has now stabilised, assured Bank of Zambia governor Jacob Mwanza at a press briefing last Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introducing new kwacka denominations, Mwanza said adverse exchange movements were expected in the first quarter of the year &quot;due to irregularities in certain areas of the financial sector&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Inflation increased early this year because the demands made on the kwacha went up,&quot; Mwanza said. &quot; There were maize imports, companies had to remit dividends, there was a diminishing of stocks on the stock market, and there was also the low ZCCM supplies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the governor dismissed any evidence of capital flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is easier to control money movement on the streets but not money kept by businesses or crooks,&quot; Mwanza explained. &quot;The country used to lose US$400 million annually until the economy was liberalised and people realised they could keep their money without threat of it being grabbed by the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanza added: &quot;Exporters are now encouraged to export more because they know they can enjoy the benefits of their forex earnings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The governor also assured that although the free market had its own risks on the whole it had been proven the world over to be a better system than enforcing restrictions on money movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kwacha's value rallied slightly at close of business on Friday. It was buying at K1, 230 in bureaux around town and selling at K1,260 compared to K1, 240 and K1, 275 respectively the week before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank of Zambia will this week start releasing new denominations of Kwacha namely, K1,000, K5,000 and K10,000 notes. The governor said these notes will take about a month to be fully integrated into the money system.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Principal divisions emerged at the height of World Press Freedom day when two media bodies differed on the legislation of a media regulatory body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zambia chapter of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) said in Lusaka yesterday it was &quot;totally&quot; opposed to any form of legislated controls of the media as advocated by the Press Association of Zambia (PAZA) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAZA issued a statement on Saturday, a day after the labour movement, students and human rights groups met in Lusaka to commemorate World Press Freedom Day organised by MISA, claiming it has been given mandate by media organisations to be an umbrella body of journalists in Zambia and to sponsor the legislation of a media driven regulatory body.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a counter reaction MISA denied being part of any such agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zambia has more than enough restrictive laws that seriously hinder the development of professional journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The repeal of these laws, and not the enactment of new ones like a Media council Act, should be the priority of all those who cherish press freedom,&quot; said Zambia Chapter, MISA chairman Fanwell Chembo and member Joseph Mkandawire in a press statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any legislated body, whether enacted with the support of media organisations like PAZA, will never have the support of MISA,&quot; the MISA statement further read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MISA also denied it would mandate PAZA, predominantly made up of government employed journalists to be the umbrella body of media work in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;MISA has among its members individuals and organisations that voluntarily opted not to belong to PAZA and their right to free association will be scrupulously respected. They will not be brought into PAZA by any other way - direct or indirect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a PAZA joint press statement released earlier by chairman John Musukuma and secretary Moses Walubita MISA and ZUJ were, effective this month, going to share offices with PAZA but MISA has denied it would ever do this.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - Addressing a rally on 27 April in Nkhata-Bay, north Malawi, AFORD President and Second Vice-President in the coalition government, Chakufwa Chihana, accused the ruling UDF and the opposition MCP, of corruption. He said AFORD was the main and only broker in Malawi, without which the country would slide into what he called chaos and confusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He accused both the UDF and MCP of being corrupt and not having the capability to govern, saying the two parties were corrupt in terms of political ideas and lacked the conception of how to plan the economic future of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UDF Publicity Secretary, Cassim Chilumpha, and MCP Acting Secretary General, Lovemore Munlo, challenged Chihana to come in the open with evidence of the corruption and accused him of irresponsibility. Chilumpha said his party was sick and tired of Chihana's allegations, saying if he thinks he is righteous he should leave government because a clean person cannot mix with corrupt people unless he is corrupt himself. For his part, Munlo described Chihana as &quot;a failure through and through in this part of Africa,&quot; adding he had no morals at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another development, AFORD's Central Region Committee on 28 April unanimously joined their northern region counterparts and agreed that their party should pull out of the government, citing, among other reasons, UDF's failure to fulfill its pre-election campaign promises and soaring commodity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, a commission of inquiry set up to probe the cause of the fire that gutted the office of the General Manager of Malawi Petroleum Control Commission in October 1995, has reached its conclusion. It has establised that the operation was planned by Aubrey Chalira, PCC's Financial Controller, to defraud the PCC of US$73,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the findings the Financial Controller was sacked from his job and the fraud referred to police for further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission recommended an improvement in the security and management of the parastatal organisation. A petroleum supply study, coordinated by the Energy and Mining Ministry and assisted by the World Bank, is currently underway and it is hoped the findings will help improve management of the commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blantyre - Health and social worker's in Malawi say that some of the country's traditional cultural practices and beliefs are a recipe for the spread of HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts say, that a decade after they began sounding the alarm about the potential dangers of some of these harmful and archaic practices, people still want to do things in the same way as their forefathers before them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take &quot;Jando&quot; or &quot;msondo&quot;, for example. Practised among the Yao and Moslem communities in southern and central Malawi, these are initiation rites where boys and girls, some as young as six, are introduced to sexual practice. At such ceremonies, they are encouraged to prove their sexual &quot;fire power&quot; - known locally as &quot;kutaya fumbi&quot; or &quot;removing the dust&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another tradition is &quot;wife inheritance&quot;, called &quot;chokolo&quot; or &quot;kuhara&quot;, and practised in almost all parts of the country though most common in northern Malawi. &quot;Chokolo&quot; is whereby a man marries the widow of his late brother or relative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Professor George Liomba, former manager of the National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), says that in Malawi, diseases are not understood in terms of viruses, bacteria, etc. Rather in terms of supernatural powers, possessed by villains who use them to make others ill. &quot;As a result, some people ignore messages from the NACP and rather go to traditional healers. They wear charms around their waists during sexual intercourse to prevent them from contracting HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liomba says, &quot;These are traditions and beliefs handed down from their forefathers and are refusing to be shaken off because, as their custodians maintain, they have stood the test of time.&quot; He also said that recognising these customs and practices is not to condemn them, as there are many good reasons why these cultural practices have been developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, there is a need to adapt them to make them safer and, in some cases, stop them altogether. A countrywide campaign, started last week, will now scrutinise the cultural practices that may have a bearing on the spread of AIDS/HIV.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - When a delegation of 200 bishops, priests, sisters and other Catholic faithful went to Rome from Khartoum, Sudan last March for the beatification of Bishop Colombo, three state security people imposed themselves on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And after the formal beatification, the three men insisted they too would go on the pilgrimage to Assisi, Verona, Loreto, Milano and other shrines relevant to the occasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One person who was not impressed by all this, is the soft-spoken bishop of El Obeid, the Right Rev. Macram Max Gassis. He joined the delegation in Rome and quite early on objected to state security presence in the midst of a purely religious affair.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We saw they were determined to come up to the beatification, so we said okay. They could see the ceremony and return to Khartoum. But these men were determined to have their way - they had come for the whole period of the pilgrimage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was all part and parcel of Khartoum's policy of harassment of the churches, asserts Bishop Macram. This harassment has the prime purpose of reducing the churches to an insignificant minority. It is a tactic to paralyse the avenues of expansion of the church in Sudan,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For nearly 10 years now, Bishop Macram has been persona non grata in that part of his diocese under government control. Today he flies into areas controlled by the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army, (SPLA). He sees it as his cardinal duty to let the world understand the numerous trials and tribulations that the churches have to surmount in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Pope visited Sudan in the early 90s, a number of Episcopalian and Catholic bishops said in a letter to the Pontiff, that while Khartoum may roll out the red carpet for him, he should keep in mind that the regime remained essentially ruthless and blood thirsty. &quot;Their hands drip with the blood of innocent people...&quot; the Sudanese clergy said in part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Macram says he has no regrets reminding people in such strong language of the happenings in Sudan. Those who wish to witness this should visit southern Kordofan area of northern Sudan which encompasses the Nuba mountains, parts of El Obeid, Wau, Rumbek and Malakal Dioceses. &quot;These are the areas of northern Sudan that are inhabited by African ethnic groups - the Nuba and the Dinka; an area where the regime's policy of Jihad or Holy War is acutely in evidence today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 3 million people live within this area of southern Kordofan which demarcates northern and southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On March 23 to 24, a contingent comprising some 700 government of Sudan soldiers from the El Saraf el Ahmer garrison, descended on villages in Kondor and Toror in the Nuba mountains and set about looting and burning anything in sight. &quot;More than 1,000 families are now homeless and without food,&quot; lamented Bishop Macram who flew into the Nuba mountains from Nairobi on April 14 and 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a sign of contempt for the people, the soldiers urinated and defecated on the food stores or burnt granaries to ashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But most painful of all is that the marauding troops did not respect the sanctity of the churches in the area. They desecrated the Holy Eucharist and tabernacle, broke to pieces the figure of Christ on the cross, looted the statue of Mary and other church items, including benches and vestments. &quot;To anybody who thinks this is propaganda, I say I have video pictures of what happened in those villages on that fateful day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bishop says the motive for these inhuman actions, is to make the people insecure and thus force them into &quot;peace camps&quot; on government held territory in Southern Kordofan. &quot;The people are routinely promised food and medicines in these camps but the women and girls are raped or taken as concubines while children are taken into slavery. All this is in Gasper Biro's report on the human rights situation in Sudan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gasper Biro is the Hungarian United Nation's Special Rapporteur on Sudan. His most recent report on the situation was released in Geneva last February 20. It says extra judicial killings, disappearance of people, abduction of children for slavery and women and girls for concubinage or rape et cetera, are a way of life in Sudan. Biro, like Bishop Macram, is persona non grata in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the suggestion that what was happening in southern Kordofan was a purely regional affair, Bishop Macram is emphatic that Khartoum was quite aware. &quot;They are quite aware and they have the power to stop it if they so wished,&quot; he toldAPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Could peace come to Sudan in his lifetime? Bishop Macram who is 58 years old, says the way forward lies in Khartoum subscribing to two fundamental principles: The principle of self determination for the South, Nuba mountains and other marginalised areas like southern Blue Nile and Southern Darfur; and The Principle of separation of religion from politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, asserts Bishop Macram, &quot;in their narrow-mindedness, the rulers in Khartoum think that by admitting self determination for the South, this would entail separation of North and South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In reality determination entails not only separation but possibilities for consolidation of the union or a confederal or federal arrangement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Macram revealed to APS that he had fully recovered from cancer of the bile duct. &quot;My recovery is a miracle.&quot; He thanked the Jesuit community at Georgetown University in the United States for the help they gave him during the time of his illness. He was particularly thankful to Father Byron of the Jesuit institute who encouraged him to go to Georgetown in 1989, the same year he was declared persona non grata in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bishop Macram says with his new lease of life he intends to redouble his efforts to make the world aware of what was happening in Sudan. He would travel more often into SPLA controlled areas in Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Antanarivo - President Albert Zafy, who came to power in a 1993 election following two years of widespread pro-democracy activity, is now under attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 15, Rev. Richard Andriamanjato, the Speaker of Madagascar's National Assembly, announced, on behalf of the most influential pro- presidential faction that they would &quot;no longer back personalities but ideas.&quot; And that, as a result, the faction would be renamed &quot;Rally for the Third Republic&quot; (RP3R) instead of &quot;Pro-Presidential Group&quot;. In clear terms, they are no longer &quot;pro-presidential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 12, another prominent member of the same faction, Mr. Alain Ramaroson, who is the leader of Rasalama Forces Vives - a large coalition of political and civil society bodies which constitutes Zafy's single largest political support - said that his group &quot;no longer shared the same views as President Zafy&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These two men were Zafy's most outspoken supporters. At the very least, these two statements constitute a last warning. And as expected, President Zafy reacted promptly in an address to the nation on April 20, promising to hold new discussions with his rebellious supporters, but only after he meets International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director-General who is due to visit Madagascar soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting with disappointment to Zafy's April 20 address, the RP3R said on April 22 said that the entire government including the prime minister had to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RP3R members have been calling for an immediate cabinet reshuffle over the last six months but to no avail. They claim that Zafy's National Union for Democracy and Development (UNDD) party is over- represented within the government, which they term as &quot;political sidelining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact things are more complicated for the president, and this &quot;last warning&quot;, more than simple family feuds, may prove fatal to his tenure of office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed this is not the first blow to Zafy's political base. Already a number of political groups which backed him during the 1993 presidential election have defected to the opposition. This category also includes others which ruled with him after his election - that of former Prime Minister Francisque Ravony and of former Industry Minister H. Razafimahaleo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil service, which played a crucial role in the 1991 popular demonstrations leading to the fall of former President Didier Ratsiraka, last January held protests over unkept promises of better terms of service. Judges have been sporadically going on strike over the leadership's reluctance to put in place the independent judicial power enshrined in the Constitution.  And Finance Ministry employees recently went on a 10-day strike which paralyzed foreign trade, calling for the sacking of the Finance Minister, a Zafy protege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Urban workers are finding themselves squeezed by an apparently irreversible decline of their purchasing power, a decline which the President has not been able to contain although his powers were reinforced by a constitutional referendum about six months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The urban workers are obviously losing patience. The Malagasy Consumers' Association (ASCOMA), a sort of loudspeaker for their concerns, recently raised its voice over an &quot;unfair amount&quot; of oil price hike. This prompted the Energy Ministry and the National Oil Company to give immediate extensive explanations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Antananarivo University students conducted street demos a few weeks ago over a cut in the amount of their grants, which resulted from the new budget voted by an opposition-dominated Parliament. Antsiranana University students too also went on strike over the same issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The business community, along with a large section of technocrats and educated Malagasies, which have all from the onset always been doubtful of Zafy's ability and competence to rule the country, decry the current failure by the leadership to conclude agreements with the Bretton Woods Institutions (after five years of deadlock).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This statement seemingly closes all doors to any serious development in the economy of this Indian Ocean island off the South-East African coast. The Rev. Richard Andriamanjato, a prominent Protestant church leader (he was former general secretary of the Nairobi-based All Africa Conference of Churches-AACC) and current speaker of the National Assembly, is described by Malagasy political observers as the major stumbling block to the resumption of normal relations between this country and World Bank and IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does the church stand in all these developments in Madagascar?  After appealing to the president, about six months ago, to act to address the &quot;considerable degradation of people's life, in all aspects&quot;, church leaders of the Madagascar Christian Council (FFKM) held separate meetings with Zafy and his prime minister on April 1 and 3, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although nothing was disclosed about the main issues discussed, the simple fact that the FFKM - supposed to be a &quot;politically neutral&quot; body, although unity among Church leaders was very instrumental to Madagascar's transition to democracy - decided to make its voice heard at the highest levels, shows how serious the current situation is. The Church in this country is considered the &quot;barometer of tolerance,&quot; particularly in political affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Already, the Church viewed with some suspicion Zafy's personal attention to various traditional Malagasy &quot;pagan&quot; ritual ceremonies (given new prominence by his regime for cultural identity purposes) and to a new Freemasonry Grand Lodge chartered recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And on April 26, Malagasy church leaders announced that they would, under the prophetic role of the Church, monitor closely how President Zafy would implement the promises he made to the nation on April 20. In a statement read in the capital, Antananarivo, Rev. Josoa Rakotonirainy, the Secretary-General of the Christian Council of Madagascar (FFKM) reminded the President of his promise to strengthen democracy and decentralization, to &quot;clean up&quot; the state apparatus and reshuffle the cabinet. The FFKM stressed that as an elder, the president would have to keep his promises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In short, Zafy is facing increasing protest from almost all quarters.  Most of these protests are centred on the president's alleged incompetence to rule the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Very surprisingly and ironically, even his own cabinet ministers also at one time joined outspoken critics, lamenting that they could not work under the new budget. However, they did not show any intention to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new budget was voted by a Parliament currently dominated by the Opposition, a real peculiarity. In fact, Malagasy politics has always, to a certain extent, been an arena of squabbling power bases and shifting alliances whose key operators are mainly power-hungry individualistic factions obsessed with short-term political gains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this already self-destructive feature of Malagasy politics seems to have been immortalized by a new concept which, in all likelihood, underlies the current political system. The concept was described more or less openly but furtively - and proudly - by the same Rev. Richard Andriamanjato as &quot;variable-geometry democracy&quot;, referring presumably to a sort of self-regulating or self-balancing mechanism aimed at preventing any possible domination of the political arena by a single party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Translated into facts, the doctrine results however in an elusive and shifty majority within the yet unexperienced Parliament. And since elusive majority also means elusive support, President Zafy finds himself ruling without &quot;reliable&quot; support and is therefore vulnerable to the most trivial issues threatening the &quot;interests&quot; of the political factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the president managed on a few occasions to superimpose another &quot;order&quot; on that highly volatile political arena, by striking the old tribalistic chord of coastal-Merina rivalry (coastal people said to be of &quot;African&quot; origin, and Merina people of &quot;Asian&quot; origin), this time the trick may not work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed among those who are persistently calling for him to resign are prominent coastal politicians, and since the current balance of forces is clearly not in his favour, other coastal politicians might well prefer recruiting another coastal man to replace him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from his own party (a very small party now strengthened by the magic of political patronage), the only possible &quot;allies&quot; remaining for President Zafy may be the inertia of the Army and rural voters, as well as the fact that Malagasy people have become contemptuous of the political community as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Army, though urged by some opposition political parties to take over power, seems to be still busy forging a new image in a democratic era where its slightest departure from a neutral stance would raise eyebrows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rural voters - unless they are bullied by Zafy's political operators pushing to turn the president's party into a strong ruling party - may continue to view him as &quot;that humble president who bothered to visit us in our remote village&quot; (Zafy has not stopped criss-crossing the whole country for about five years now).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And to be able to stay until the 1998 presidential elections, Zafy may also count on a new feature of Malagasy society; people's general disillusion at and contempt to the political community as a whole as well as on their lack of interest in anything related to political activism. A phenomenon which also explains why the opposition is currently finding it difficult to gather meaningful popular support for their cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the more and more organized and united opposition, operating both from within and from outside Parliament is increasing its pressures.  Majority-holder opposition Mps, frustrated by the president's reluctance to recognize their &quot;right&quot; (as a majority) to govern, vow to resort eventually to an &quot;impeachment&quot; move provided in the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former President Ratsiraka, now in France for health reasons, has called for early presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, another opposition group, the SFFF (Platform for Reflection on National Recovery), operating from outside the Parliament through what it calls &quot;street democracy&quot; (demos, calls for general strike, etc.), says that Zafy has to leave office by May 1996, adding that so far peaceful means to oust him have proved inefficient.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - For the first time in his capacity as the chairman of the United Nations Administrative Committee Coordination (ACC), United Nations Secretary General Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali visited Kenya to preside over the ACC meeting from April 28 to 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACC is the highest level coordination body in the UN system, whose members include the executive heads of all United Nations organizations and agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting in the Kenyan capital was the first of the twice-yearly ACC session to be held in a developing country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high level meeting focused on the implementation of the new UN Special Initiative for Africa which was launched by United Nations system through a global tele-conference in cooperation with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on March 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In remarks broadcast world-wide, the Secretary-General called on the global community to join in an effort intended to benefit millions of people in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is the first time the United Nations will work in an integrated manner to promote development of an entire continent,&quot; the Secretary General stated on his arrival in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting also discussed the development of a system wide approach to implement programmes of action adopted at the international conference and summits convened over the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the second day of his visit Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali met Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi at State House here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the meeting at which President Moi pledged his full support for United Nations activities for peace and security in Africa, the two leaders reviewed issues of peace and security with special reference to situations in Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia and Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also discussed at State House is the series of United Nations initiatives to reverse the trend of political and economic marginalisation of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responding to questions from the press as to why it had taken too long to end marginalization and develop Africa, Dr. Ghali said development problems cannot be solved in a moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He charged that with the end of the Cold War a few years ago, Africa is still experiencing donor fatigue characterized by internal wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Efforts to contain marginalization have been mentioned in meetings in China, Japan and Korea,&quot; said Dr. Ghali, adding that it is important to have inter agency participation in solving the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Boutros Boutros Ghali stated that efforts are underway to see to it that in the coming 10 years Africans will have less foreign assessors. This phenomenon will be replaced by great market economy on education, health and sanitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He dismissed allegations that the United Nations offices are to be transferred elsewhere outside Africa, saying; &quot;I have heard these stupid stories for the last 20 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General agreed with criticisms over withdrawal of peace keeping forces in Rwanda, saying any human organizations may have successes and failures &quot;but this was the member states' decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked how confident the UN is to raise 25 billion dollars for the newly launched UN Initiative for Africa with the prevailing financial problem in his organization, Dr. Ghali said there is enough support for the UN as an instrument to promote peace, national reconciliation, settling disputes and dealing with refugee problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While in Kenya, Dr. Ghali also received a delegation of African Ambassadors accredited to the United Nations office in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting agreed on the importance of retaining the United Nations office in Nairobi (UNON) as the only centre in the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Ghali cautioned that the financial situation of the UN and budget reduction voted by the General Assembly had led to the present financial difficulties felt by the office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Windhoek - Some Angolan refugees, who would be repatriated back home when a church-sponsored programme gets underway are likely to be affected by landmines planted all over the country, according to a regional conference on church refugee activities in Southern Africa, held here from April 22 to 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the 40 delegates to the conference who included church refugee workers, church leaders and officials from the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) and the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC), recommended that Angolan churches should be ready to give the returnees guidance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Henry Odraa-Raga, the AACC Project Officer for Refugee and Emergency Services, who attended the conference, says the proposed repatriation programme is scheduled to take off mid this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But this will depend on many things. These include the proposed visit to Angola by both the chairman and the Secretary of the AACC refugee regional committee for southern African region, Rev. White Rakuba and Rev. Shirley Diworlf respectively,&quot; Odraa-Raga toldAPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed out that the outcome of the visit by representatives of the refugee committee to Angola will form a basis for the financial commitment and modalities to be used to implement the repatriation programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Quoting some statistics presented at the conference by an official from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Mr. Odraa-Raga said there were an estimated 120,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia, 200,000 in Zaire and another 5,000 in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Mr. Odraa-Raga, the conference for the Southern African region was part of the AACC/WCC efforts to regionalise the refugee activities on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have already held one for Eastern Africa region and we are scheduled to hold a combined one for Western and Central Africa regions in Accra, Ghana from May 20 to 26,&quot; noted the AACC Project Officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The week-long conference, which was attended by among others the AACC General Secretary, Rev. Jose Chipenda, the head of the Refugee and Emergency Services at the WCC, Mr. Melaku Kifle and the General Secretary of the Council of Churches in Namibia, Rev. Dr. Ngeno Nakamhela, discussed various subjects under the topic &quot;Southern African Churches in Ministry with Uprooted People&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addressing the meeting, Rev. Chipenda welcomed the idea of &quot;regionalising&quot; the church sponsored refugee activities in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The aim behind the move is to take the refugee issues closer to the people and churches in general. As churches, refugee and church workers,let us help the entire church in Africa realise this dream,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his address, Rev. Nakamhela noted that during the years of the struggle for independence, the Namibian churches ministered to people uprooted by the system of migrant labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another group of people uprooted in Namibia's recent past were those who went into exile during the struggle for independence, Rev. Nakamhela further told the conference delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After independence in 1990, the churches rendered counselling services to families of exiles and those repatriated. The churches were also active in Namibia's resettlement programme for thousands of people who returned from exile in other parts of Africa, Europe and North America, the CCN General Secretary told the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola, which has faced one of the most intensified civil wars since independence in 1975, has some 638,430 internally displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other statistics show that the country is severely affected by between 9 to 10 million land mines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nairobi - It is important that the Church creates an enabling environment that facilitates free flow of information both within the church structures and in society at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These sentiments were expressed at a recent workshop here which brought together Church communication workers drawn from Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist and African Instituted churches countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 35 participants discussing various topics under the theme, &quot;Communication for Participatory Democracy: How will they know? agreed that one cannot participate without information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, hierarchical structures are such that information is left to the top of the structures, and the majority who will be affected by any decisions made never quite understand the circumstances surrounding certain decisions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communicator thus has the vital role of being the bridge builder between the hierarchy and members as well as among the members so that all can be persuaded to take a level ground to change their society for the better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Workshop participants noted there was a need for the church to create a value system for society by exploring good values and recognizing her ethical and moral mission as the conscience of society. This would in turn enable participatory communication that allows the free flow of information, challenging authoritarian and autocratic tendencies. The church should also be a fore-runner in recognizing the role of women and changing society's thinking on the political and social status of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communicators were urged on their part to research well by especially being sensitive to people's needs and know what is in the public interest.  They should strive to remain beyond manipulation, identify with the marginalised in society and give a voice to those from whom one has been taken away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among issues highlighted was the lobbying for a community radio service to meet the needs of rural people who presently have no form of community expression other than local dances and informal meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to Bishop Horace Etemesi of the Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) Diocese of Butere, Western Kenya, community expression such as dances and local songs should also be used to compose Christian songs so that people are not uprooted from their cultural roots when they adopt Christianity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In giving guidelines towards &quot;developing a media policy for the church&quot;, Bishop Etemesi said media have a prophetic mission and one working in that sphere is bound to face tremendous challenges, suffering and sometimes even ridicule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But one must be courageous enough, having studied the best means of communication and the risks involved to move right ahead with the venture.  One must be careful to reach the targeted audience and be willing to stand by the truth no matter the consequences, noted the CPK clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One should also find out what the targeted audience likes reading, in what language, how often and also know what radio programmes they listen to.  There is also a need to have an in-built evaluating process that checks the goals against achievements, disparities and their causes as well as committee or board performance. The question: &quot;What is unique about our product?&quot; should be asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rev. Joyce Karuri (Anglican), the World Association for Christian Communication-Africa Region (WACC-AR) Treasurer, lamented that although the Bible is the most political book ever published and 70 per cent of Kenyans are Christians, very few of them hear their civil and political rights advanced from the pulpit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She noted that Christ was never the passive observer but rather the active participant in cleansing the temple when it was turned into a den of trade. He actively participated in setting things right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rev. Martha Ngugi observed that among the ranks of ordained ministers, men still enjoyed better benefits than women for similar jobs. For instance, although both men and women go through the same theological training programmes, it is automatic for a man to be ordained while a woman takes a much longer time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chances of promotion up to the level of Bishop are obviously higher for the man and this means better terms of service, better salaries and other emoluments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet God shows no partiality when He uses people in His vineyard as instruments for restoring order in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rev. Ngugi advises the various women groups found in the churches to stand together in unity to challenge the policies, structures and patterns which prevent them from holding decision making positions. She urges the media to continually play up the positive image of women as achievers and keep this agenda high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Jane Gitau, Director of Communication in the CPK cautioned church leaders against taking the influence of mass media or congregations for granted. She said mass media not only challenge the faith of believers but also present a plurality of faiths with impartiality. They reveal the fact that Christianity is not the unchallenged world religion it was assumed to be 50 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gitau observed that Christian communication must be revolutionized by awakening the conscience and reflecting the cooperate witness of the Church as a healer, liberator and giver of life. It must enable the people articulate their own needs, serve truth and challenge falsehood as well as be prophetic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Cameroonian forces in the disputed Bakassi peninsula have killed one Nigerian soldier and left two other wounded in an ambush on April 24, Defence Ministry deputy spokesman Colonel Godwin Ugbo announced here on April 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ugbo said a Nigerian military vehicle carrying out a routine patrol of Nigerian positions in the border territory on the Gulf of Guinea was ambushed in an attack and accused Cameroon of carrying out offensive operations since the start of the week, although the situation had calmed down by April 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 26, Nigerian Information Minister Walter Ofonagoro said skirmishes had taken place on April 21 and April 23, and blamed the Cameroon side for opening fire first on both occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister warned Cameroon to cease and desist from further acts of aggression on Bakassi, a continued escalation of the conflict in the peninsula cannot serve any useful purpose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 25, Brigadier-General Victor Malu, commander of the Nigerian 82nd division at Enugu in the east of the country, whose forces are deployed in the peninsula, held a meeting with his officers and the captain of the vessel Victor Ombu, chief of naval forces in the east of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian press reports gave no details of the meeting, held in Calabar, the capital of the southeastern Cross River state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But on April 27, Cameroon counter-accused Nigeria of launching new attacks on its territory in breach of its international obligations and demanded that Abuja pull back its troops to the positions it occupied on the disputed Bakassi peninsula last February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Minister Ferdinand Oyono said in a statement that Nigerian troops had attacked Cameroon troops on the peninsula &quot;on April 21, 22, 23 and 24.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The object of the attacks, he said, was &quot;to occupy positions ever deeper in Cameroon territory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attacks were &quot;a flagrant violation&quot; of a March 5 ruling by the International Court of Justice in the Hague, calling on the two sides to pull back to positions they held before February 3, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement was Yaounde's first official reaction to a series of frontier incidents reported by Nigeria over the past few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bakassi peninsula is an area of some 1,000 square kilometers, believed to be rich in oil as well as fish stocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both countries massed soldiers there following clashes early in 1994. At some points, their troops' positions are only about 100 metres apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last clashes occurred in February, leaving four dead and 13 wounded on the Nigerian side, Nigerian press reports said. Cameroon radio spoke of one dead on each side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In late March, the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which had been asked by the two countries to rule on the dispute, called for troops on both sides to pull back to positions they held before February 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The court also asked them to refrain from all military operations on the peninsula, and to respect ceasefire agreements reached by their Foreign Ministers in Kara, Togo on February 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 24, sources close to the Red Cross said the Cameroonian authorities were still holding 30 Nigerian civilians taken prisoner during clashes on the disputed border territory of the Bakassi Peninsula in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Yaounde have visited the detainees and confirmed that they were civilians taken prisoner by Cameroonian troops during fighting on the Gulf of Guinea peninsula between February 3 and 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Nigerian Defence Ministry spokesman General Fred Chijuka denied the Cameroonian government's claim that they were holding 30 Nigerian military prisoners-of-war, including a general, saying the detainees were Nigerian fishermen captured by the Cameroonian forces.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nakuru,Kenya - African theologians have been asked to help interpret the gospel message according to the people's cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This appeal was made by theologians attending a pan-African consultation here, some 160 kilometres north-west of Nairobi. The 15 participants called upon fellow theologians to make a serious analysis of African cultures and bring new African insights that are needed for the growth and understanding of the church in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the communique issued at the end of the April 14 to 20 consultation, the African theological hermeneutical (scriptural interpretation) framework that is emerging raises concerns over elements in African cultures and in the Christian tradition that are not consistent with the gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The week-long meeting was jointly organised by the department of Theology and the Christian Education and Family Life Education Programme of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The communique pointed out that results of the study process on gospel and culture at the national level show that Africans have affirmed the gospel as the Good News of Salvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But because the gospel came with a different cultural garb, churches in Africa have been struggling to make it relevant to their value system in spiritual matters, the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gospel read and interpreted by an African, must be heard speaking to Africans in a language that they understand, noted the theologians. They added; &quot;The language and interpretation must bring Africans together and do away with divisions that are killing the African race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The participants also discussed the influence of mega cultures which they argued, threatens the future of African cultures and the hope for generations to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They observed that the existence of African instituted churches and emergence of new churches such as the Rima church in South Africa, among others, is a sign of the dissatisfaction from the missionary oriented churches and the cultural influence that accompany their mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the meeting participants, the African cultures have been trampled upon and &quot;thus our understanding of and living the gospel expectations is seriously compromised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inhuman division of the African continent which includes the cries and bleeding of African children in Rwanda, Burundi, Sudan, Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and elsewhere, &quot;challenges us to ask whether the gospel has equipped us as African churches to say or do anything about these situations,&quot; observed the theologians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his opening speech, the AACC General Secretary, Rev. Jose Chipenda stressed the centrality for the study process of gospel and culture for the church in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The study is central for the church in Africa, especially at this time when the continent is faced with issues of globalisation, privatisation and fragmentation,&quot; said Rev. Chipenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing that the gospel is the future of mankind, the AACC head stressed that the question at hand is: &quot;How do we use it to bring unity among the people of the world and Africans especially?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the communique, the study will form the position paper to be presented at the forthcoming World Conference on Mission and Evangelism which will be organised by the World Council of Churches (WCC) in Brazil later this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monrovia - Hopes for peace have nosedived in the Liberian capital as rival gunmen fought in the streets of Monrovia on May 1, forcing hundreds more civilians to flee to a residential compound that has become a teeming makeshift refugee camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The militias traded gunfire near the Barclay Training Centre, a military barracks that has been at the centre of the latest flareup in Liberia's six-year-old civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sporadic machine gun fire could also be heard at Mamba Point, where most embassies are located.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting had spread to that area on April 30, and US marines guarding the American Embassy shot unidentified gunmen who had opened fire on the facility. Three Liberians were killed, US officials said in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the first clash in Monrovia involving US forces. The fighting that has ravaged the city since April 6 pits Krahn fighters against gunmen loyal to warlords Charles Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, both of whom sit on a collegial presidency formed under a peace agreement signed in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It all started when police acting on orders from Taylor tried to arrest Roosevelt Johnson, former leader of a Krahn faction, on charges of murder.  Johnson's fighters went on a rampage, and the city quickly degenerated into violent anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Krahn forces overran part of Mamba Point on May 1, but pulled out when the rival militias showed up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A ceasefire in force for nine days was shattered on April 29 when the presidential palace was attacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, George Moose, was supposed to meet with factional leaders on April 30 to try to restore the ceasefire, but the meetings were cancelled because of the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moose, the US administration's top official on Africa, who had arrived in Monrovia on April 30 to try to break the elusive jinx bedeviling the battling factions, had to spend the night in the embassy and left on May 1 following the failure of his mediation attempts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moose, who had been planning a six-nation tour, was not able to speak to any of the leaders of the battling factions in Monrovia before his unscheduled departure for Washington via Abidjan in neighbouring Ivory Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The city was calm overnight but heavy machine gun fire erupted at dawn outside the Barclay barracks, a Krahn stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several hundred women and children were seen fleeing to Greystone, a residential compound near the US embassy, joining the estimated 25,000 displaced persons already there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly 270 US marines are in Monrovia guarding American diplomatic installations. They are part of a larger expeditionary force of 2,939 troops, most of whom are stationed off the coast of five US warships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Liberian crisis led the US military to evacuate over 2,000 US citizens and other foreign nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace accord signed last August was this west African country's 11th attempt at ending the civil war that broke out in 1990 when Taylor led a rebel force that invaded from the north and ousted longtime dictator Samuel Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The collegial presidency formed under the accord is an interim government that is supposed to lead the country to elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos - Muslims observing a religious holiday in the northern city of Kano attacked Christians praying nearby and left about 20 people injured, four of them seriously, residents said on April 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clash occurred on April 28 at Bayero University in Kano. The injured included a Briton who teaches geography at the institution. He was treated in hospital for deep cuts on his head, face and arms, the residents said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said the incident occurred as a group of Muslims were praying on a field to mark the Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha, which marks the end of the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Muslims, who said they had been disturbed by the Christians, also broke windows and doors in the lecture hall where the Christians were praying, residents said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Christians at the university have not been allowed to build a church so they use classrooms as places of worship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kano, capital of the state of the same name and Nigeria's second largest commercial centre, is predominantly Muslim and over the past 15 years, it has seen many religious clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest clash comes only two weeks since Nigerian military junta of General Sani Abacha sacked the northern Nigerian-based spiritual Muslim leader Ibrahim Dasuki on charges that he misused funds donated for the building of mosques and for other purposes and replaced him with a new leader, Mohammed Maccido, who took over on April 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to reports published here on April 29, Muslims in southern Nigeria have questioned the authority of the new northern-based leader of the country's Muslim community, the first time the authority of Nigeria's Muslim leader, known as the Sultan of Sokoto, has been openly challenged. Sokoto is a city in northern Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kazeem Akerede, president of the League of Imams and Alfas (Islamic teachers) in eight states in the southwest and in central Kwara and Kogi states, challenged whether Maccido or any occupant of that office is in fact the spiritual leader of all Nigerian Muslims, who number 47.2 million out of a population of more than 100 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking at a news conference at Akure on April 29, Akerede said that the sultan &quot;is only a traditional ruler in his town but not a spiritual leader of all Muslims in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the sultan's leadership of the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs did not automatically make him head of Islamic faith in Nigeria, as the council &quot;was not for all Muslims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Religion is not a political party but a spiritual matter and our guidance springs from the Koran,&quot; added Akerede.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations- Diplomatic sanctions against Sudan adopted by the United Nations Security Council take effect on May 10 over Khartoum's presumed links with terrorism and its refusal to extradite terrorists who tried to murder Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak at last June's Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mild sanctions, aimed at securing the extradition of Islamic suspects wanted in connection with the assassination attempt on Mubarak, were contained in resolution 1053 adopted here on April 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But two states in the 15-member Council, China and Russia, signaled their unease about imposing sanctions by abstaining in the vote.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several speakers noted that the resolution provided for discussion of possible further measures against Khartoum in July, and expressed concern about the use of the sanctions weapon which they said could backfire against the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures which come into force at 0401 GMT on May 10 provide for travel restrictions affecting Sudanese government officials and diplomats, and cutbacks in the number and level of Sudanese diplomatic missions worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution also calls on Khartoum to desist from supporting terrorism, a charge strongly denied by Sudanese Ambassador Ali Mohamed Osman Yassin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution, co-sponsored by five non-aligned countries including Sudan's neighbour Egypt, was the subject of tough negotiations for weeks and Egyptian ambassador Nabil Elaraby stressed that the Council had taken pains to ensure that the Sudanese people would not be hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Russia and China abstained in the vote for various stated reasons, the United States ambassador had warned that his country &quot;did not believe the sanctions outlined in this resolution were sufficient to convince the government of Sudan to cease its sponsorship of international terrorism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time the Security Council was imposing sanctions on Sudan, the US State Department also announced that Sudan would remain on its &quot;black list&quot; of seven countries that support terrorism which, which it promised to release on April 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Arab states, including Egypt whose president was the victim of the assassination attempt, had also balked at imposing harsh international sanctions against a third Arab government, after Iraq and Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese ambassador noted that his country was the third in the region to be hit by sanctions, saying: &quot;Can we consider this a coincidence, or is this a deliberate scheme against that region, its cultures, its peoples, and its faiths,&quot; and protested that the Security Council, which called on Sudan to &quot;ensure extradition to Ethiopia of the three suspects sheltered in Sudan,&quot; had failed to take note of Khartoum's efforts to track down the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resolution provides for the Security Council to discuss Sudan's compliance with the resolution 60 days after May 10, and to decide then whether further measures are necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Scenes of high political drama played out in Parliament's old Assembly chamber early on Thursday morning when African National Congress negotiators declared deadlocks with the National Party on single-medium instruction, property rights and the employers' right to lockout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis, culminating at the end of a marathon all-night session of the Constitutional Committee, brought the process to the brink of collapsing into deadlock- breaking mechanisms provided for in the interim Constitution - setting negotiators face-to-face with the possibility of the country having to go to a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC was committed to going the referendum route if the deadlock could not be broken, ANC MP Carl Niehaus said on Thursday. &quot;Warning lights are flicking. We feel so strongly about it that we are prepared to go that route, rather than compromise,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Efforts to resolve the impasse were to resume on Thursday after party caucuses. The Constitutional Committee was to reconvene on Friday to consider ANC proposals on the issues. The parties agreed to try to resolve the three outstanding issues before 10am on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has meanwhile called a special meeting of its central executive committee for Monday, when it will consider the progress made. Cosatu secretary general Sam Shilowa told the M&amp;G the federation would mobilise its members if there was no agreement, focusing action - in tandem with the ANC - on a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exhausted negotiators left the chamber around 5.30am on Thursday with a warning from a disappointed Constitutional Assembly co-chair Cyril Ramaphosa ringing in their ears: &quot;The route we may embark upon in the next 24 hours, if we do not reach agreement, could well spell disaster for our country. The entire world had hoped we would draft a Constitution in peace,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After ANC negotiators declared they were unable to reach agreement with the NP on the three issues, NP negotiator Roelf Meyer said his party believed resolution was possible, and declared the NP's commitment to reaching agreement. His proposal for a 24-hour adjournment, &quot;to put in every effort on resolving the outstanding matters&quot;, was carried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC negotiator Valli Moosa expressed doubts, however. Moosa said for the ANC, the three rights - all issues around which apartheid had revolved - were central to South Africa's transformation. To compromise would be &quot;a betrayal of victims of apartheid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moosa was no longer certain agreement was possible. The ANC would table amendments on the issues on Friday: &quot;If there is no agreement, we will in any case ask for a decision so that the Bill tabled does not have blank spaces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the Constitution is tabled for the vote, it will be voted on as a whole, not clause by clause. Should the NP vote against it, the ANC will still be able to reach a 51% majority. In terms of the deadlock-breaking mechanisms, the Bill then goes to a panel of experts, which must present a new draft within 30 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a fresh vote still fails to reach the required two-third's majority, the ANC will have the option of drawing up its own text. All deals and compromises reached between the parties so far would, in this event, probably fall away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adoption of the new text would require only a simple majority. It would then have to be certified by the Constitutional Court as compatible with the 34 principles in the interim Constitution. If certified, it would then go before the country in a referendum, and would be adopted if there was a 60% majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ramaphosa started sifting through the deadlock-breaking mechanisms at 3am on Thursday, &quot;when it became clear to me these outstanding matters were becoming unresolvable&quot;, putting the process in the &quot;danger zone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned that if negotiators took &quot;a wrong turn in the next 24 hours&quot;, they &quot;could do something to regret for many months, if not years, to come&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's transition was still fragile, he added. Resorting to the deadlock-breaking mechanism had implications for the country in terms of the economy, race relations and reconciliation: &quot;All sorts of things start coming undone - the centre may not hold.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some might think it &quot;fashionable&quot; to hold to a position &quot;and even become a bit arrogant and say to hell with them&quot;, but it was time to think about South Africa, he said. &quot;For me this is a very sad moment. One had hoped we would never reach this stage.&quot; Based on his experience over the past months of the spirit of give and take in resolving problems, he had been &quot;brimming with optimism and sending out positive signals that we would resolve our problems&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, Ramaphosa listened to ANC negotiators reporting on the deadlocks. MP Blade Nzimande said the ANC was trying to accommodate every language group in the country with a clause allowing education in the language of choice where reasonably practicable. The NP's desire to have single-medium instruction entrenched signalled a return to Verwoerdian apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baleka Kgositsile said the NP was not negotiating in good faith on the property clause: political agreement was reached last Sunday based on a formulation agreed to at the Arniston bosberaad two weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Willie Hofmeyr said the ANC had tried to accommodate the NP on the lockout clause, as well as its fears on the other issues. The deadlocks all focused on where the NP was trying to depart from internationally accepted rights in a bid to preserve privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roelf Meyer told the gathering the transparency of the Consitution process meant both the ANC and NP had come under pressure from constituencies outside the Assembly and that parties alone were not to blame for the impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the M&amp;G the ANC and Cosatu had been unable to agree on the lockout clause, an assertion denied by ANC MP Phillip Dexter, one of the South African Communist Party representatives in alliance talks on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The NP's game all along was to try to split the alliance on the issue because it knew the ANC was under pressure from employers as well as from Cosatu. The game has been to drive a wedge between the ANC and Cosatu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The leadership of the ANC has been absolutely firm on the issue. It has considered ways of dealing with the problem, but will not put lockout into the Constitution, whether in drag or through the back door.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shilowa said alliance talks had been easier than those with ANC negotiators who were &quot;in the heat of things&quot;. He said: &quot;We were dealing with a situation where the ANC would want to ensure that a referendum would not be a result of lack of trying (to reach agreement) on the ANC's part.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A banana war between two of Somalia's main warlords is under way over the control of the lucrative banana export trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forces of General Mohamed Farah Aideed, the self-proclaimed president of Somalia, are pitted against the militiamen of his former financier, Ali Hassan Osman &quot;Atto&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed needs the revenues, estimated at around $800 000 a month, to pay his soldiers as he tries to establish his control in the Bay and Bakol regions and take on the Rahenweyne clan. Atto, in a lose alliance with another self- proclaimed president, Ali Mahdi Mohammed based in northern Mogadishu, wants to deny him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renewed clashes beginning last month have left scores of people dead, as business leaders and elders attempt to negotiate a truce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What's happening in Mogadishu is an economic war; an attempt to control the port of Merca and Somalia's lucrative banana trade. That's why the fighting is not being joined by other Somali factions,&quot; says Hussein Ali Dualleh of the Nairobi-based Somali Affairs Monitoring Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atto and Ali Mahdi blocked Aideed from using Mogadishu port last October. Fighting again flared in March when Atto demanded that the warlord either share the revenues from Merca or see that port closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the battle that followed, Aideed's forces were overrun. A full-scale war was averted after elders of the Habir Gedir clan, to which the two warlords belong, persuaded Atto to withdraw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As they pulled back to Mogadishu, Atto's militia felt &quot;humiliated and bitter&quot;, according to a Somali elder who refused to be named, &quot;and they immediately attacked Aideed's forces. That's the origin of the present conflict.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Somalia collapsed into the anarchy of warlord politics with the overthrow of former dictator Siad Barre in 1991, the country was earning some $20-million annually from banana exports. That represented around 15% of the country's total export earnings.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Everybody knows these men are guilty. Why are you wasting everybody's time?&quot; he scolded a defence lawyer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a murmur of agreement swept the room, the two Russian defendants looked despondently about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You can't just determine who's guilty. You can't prejudge,&quot; their lawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some spectators agreed, but only because they harboured theories of cover-ups, gun-running and even sorcery in the presidential palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the dock stood Nicolai Kazarine and Andrei Gouskov, Russian pilots who had been in Zaire just three days in January when their cargo plane barely lifted off from the heart of Kinshasa before dropping back to earth in the midst of a bustling market at the end of the runway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the propellers carved their way through the stalls, 225 people died.  The carnage was so complete that only 66 bodies were identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecutor, Jean Mukenge Bisumbule, alleges that the old Soviet Antonov plane was travelling at barely half the required speed when it lifted off. Mukenge blames an excess of vodka for the pilots' slow reactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kazarine, dressed in a worn T-shirt, frayed track-suit bottoms and flip flops, denies he was drunk. He claims the plane was grossly overloaded by a Zairean official who falsified documents and has since disappeared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The prosecutor accused us of being drunk without any proof. All these attempts to abuse us are to divert the court from the real causes of the catastrophe. The company overloaded the plane and wants to blame us,&quot; Kazarine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Russians have been in jail for three months, supposedly to protect them from victims' relatives. But some survivors who attend each session of the trial, usually held on one day a week, say the real criminals are government officials who permitted a market at the end of a runway. Others, such as Dimba Lutomadio, who saw her 65-year-old mother killed and her younger sister lose an arm, see a conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This trial is a masquerade. The lawyers are creating confusion so we do not find out what really happened. They were not taking it seriously so we stopped them outside here and told them we would burn their cars. Now they have admitted that the plane was chartered by a general close to President Mobutu. Now we want to know where that plane was going and what it was doing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the charter company, African Air, insists in court that the flight was carrying food to southern Zaire, the pilots say from their cells that they were on an illegal mission to deliver supplies to Unita rebels in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;African Air couldn't file a flight plan to Angola because these flights are illegal. That's why they gave our flight plan as Kahemba (in Zaire). I've done it many times before, but I don't know if there were weapons on board - we didn't check the boxes,&quot; Kazarine said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the word in Kinshasa's shanty towns is that President Mobutu sese Seko engineered the plane crash as part of some ritual Satanic sacrifice to bolster his power. The president is also blamed for a series of bus crashes, a train wreck and even a cholera outbreak.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A new independent newspaper will hit Zimbabwe's streets next week in an effort to keep alive a faltering voice in the national press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zimbabwe Independent, a business-oriented weekly, comes in the wake of a crisis in the independent press which has seen many publications disappear or teeter on the brink of financial collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After blossoming in the wake of political liberalisation in the late Eighties, Zimbabwe's celebrated private sector press has been buffeted in the Nineties by the strong winds of economic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High interest rates, soaring production costs and restricted consumer demand led to shrinking margins. As a result the commercial foundations of the private sector press have been severely eroded, and the scope and national reach of published opinion has narrowed. Zimbabweans might now feel freer to criticise government and debate national policy, but there are few places where their voices can be heard.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a flurry of publishing activity featuring a rash of new titles in the early Nineties, Zimbabwe's publishing giants reasserted themselves. Today the market is dominated more than ever by Zimpapers, the publicly owned government-controlled chain which publishes six papers, including four weeklies and the country's only two dailies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, whereas Zimpapers wields unchallenged command of market share, it no longer leads opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the early Nineties ordinary Zimbabweans had a brief taste of a free press, and they liked it,&quot; says Independent assistant editor Iden Wetherall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since then space has opened in the media market, because the broad readership has become more sophisticated. Zimbabweans will no longer accept news which is hidden, distorted or massaged by editors unashamedly beholden to the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimpapers' primary unearned advantage rests in the fact there are few alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clutch of smaller monthlies and weeklies, addressing themselves to narrower communities, have mostly shied away from trying to establish a broad national presence. A limited set of popular magazines, which have been more politically adventurous, have had muted impact because of their limited publication frequency and distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, newspapers which have tried to break the Zimpapers monopoly have been confronted by the enormous and rising costs involved - and by a government jealous off its privileged access to the national press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest victim of tightening margins and the ruling party's political sensitivities is Modus Publications, where spiralling debt fuelled by punishing interest rates forced the closure of two papers and the editorial reining-in of a third, the respected Financial Gazette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once a leading exponent of critical opinion and debate, the Gazette's editorial independence gradually fell prey to demands from Modus's owners, themselves under pressure from their creditors at the government- controlled Zimbank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of management's increasing admonition to ease up on criticism of the government and ruling party, Gazette editor Trevor Ncube and several other senior editorial staff left the paper this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, Modus has struggled to maintain the Gazette's traditional readership and advertising base. Staff and infrastructure have been pared back sharply, in a desperate attempt to cut costs and stay afloat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this - the financial collapse of Modus and the political crumbling of Zimpapers' legitimacy - has left a gaping hole at the heart of the Zimbabwean newspaper market, which the Independent aims to fill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With solid capital, management and editorial resources (including a translocated senior editorial team from Modus, headed by former Gazette editor Ncube), there is a good chance it will succeed. Nonetheless, the paper's backing raises questions about where the Independent's support comes from, and which national voice it represents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Independent's leading investors, Clive Murphy and Clive Wilson, have been important players in the local industry since the Eighties, when both were involved in the ownership and management of the Gazette. In 1989 they sold their controlling interest in Modus to the company's curent owners, a consortium of black businessmen led by former Zimpapers CEO, Elias Rusike. In the following years Murphy and Wilson consolidated a new publishing company and developed a national distribution agency, both of which will now help support the Independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the origins of the paper's capital backing expose it to populist attacks from government and an increasingly militant black business &quot;indigenisation&quot; lobby, the composition of the Independent's editorial staff make it difficult to sustain this line of criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The editorial team insists it has been given firm guarantees of editorial autonomy by the Independent's owners, and that the previous editorial line developed during tenure at the black-owned Modus will be maintained. That stance included support for meaningful &quot;black empowerment&quot; measures, as well as government's punishing economic reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But both these positions may well become sticking points for the Independent in the current era of indigenisation politics, which has seen pressure groups calling for the rapid indigenisation of the economy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - For some people just telling their story is a comfort, but the truth commission is finding it harder to solve some of the other problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two very different people walked into Johannesburg's Central Methodist Church this week and, beneath the stained-glass images of Christ on the way to Calvary, sat to tell harrowing tales which tested to the full the truth commission's offer of comfort and catharsis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> George Dube's story begins with a relentless diet of fish and beans in an Umkhonto weSizwe training camp in Angola. He explained how, fed up with the meals that were upsetting his ulcers, he sold some belongings to an Angolan soldier for a bus fare to Luanda where he would explain the problem to his commanders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the way to the bus stop some Angolan policemen stopped him. Dube could not speak Portuguese. They could not speak English. He had old Angolan currency on him. And he had grown a beard. The Angolans deduced he was one of Jonas Savimbi's foreign mercenaries and took him to a nearby prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dube spent three years there during which time he was joined by another 11 ANC members suspected of being spies. He says there were regular beatings by the Angolan warders and one of his friends, Tom Mabinda, was shot dead in front of him by the guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His account of prison conditions deviates into an account of the appalling food. People in the audience giggle at the cranky man who has clearly become obsessed with the workings of his stomach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is around 4pm and the hearings are running two hours late. One of the commissioners, Bongani Finca, tries to hurry him up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dube says the group was transferred to an ANC rehabilitation centre after staging a hunger strike. There they were forced to do hard labour. &quot;I was beaten every day. It would be your lucky day if you were not beaten ... I have seen movies about slavery and they way we treated it was like hell,&quot; he claims. &quot;I prayed that I would wake up being dead ... that they would separate my soul from my body.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were regular torture sessions to extract confessions from the spies. &quot;I didn't know what to tell them because I have never been a spy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three years later Dube and some of the others were released and sent to a camp in Uganda. &quot;The commissar said 'Congress sometimes makes a mistake'.&quot; And the detainees were told they would be sent back to the camp if they told anyone of their experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is there anything else he would like to tell the commission, asks Finca.  &quot;Listen my friend they used to make us run to the toilet. There was no walking there. And then you couldn't sit there and reflect. It was half a minute and you were out.&quot; And when he asked for stomach pills he got headache pills and headache pills when he wanted stomach pills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More giggles from the gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finca asks if there is any request Dube would like to put to the commission. He explains he had tried courses in bricklaying, farming and cooking at the ANC camps but failed all of them. &quot;I still want to learn to be a chef because I like cooking. I was asking them to send me to a school like this very school for cooking which I wanted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dube appears to be a lonely and confused man unable to find any coherent explanation of the trauma he has been through other than that he complained of eating too much beans and fish. Psychologists describe the condition as shattered cognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when he walked out of the church it was clear that, unlike the man depicted in the beautiful windows above him, Dube had not found the meaning and understanding that would be his first step on the road to healing. Nor is he likely to find any place in a school for cooks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Hawa Timol it must have been very different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ailing old lady on crutches, flanked by caring and nurturing sons, explains in broken Gujerati how the security police broke her heart when they came to say her son, Ahmed Timol, had jumped from the 10th floor of John Vorster Square.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I told the man he should go home and ask his wife what it means for a mother to rear a child and never see him,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later, after repeated raids and interrogations, they came again to say her other son, Mohammed, would only be released from detention if he agreed to work as an informer. &quot;I told them that if my body had a zip they could open it and see how I was aching inside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time there is no laughter in the gallery, only tears and a lump in every throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mohammed Timol, who survived his term in jail after the brothers were arrested in 1963, explains how his brother had worked in the underground of the South African Communist Party and the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For him and his mother, it is intensely gratifying that Ahmed is receiving the recognition he deserves. &quot;He was one of the many South Africans, young and old, to bring about a democratic dispensation in South Africa.&quot; He asks that the school in Roodepoort where he taught be given the name Ahmed Timol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They know why he died and, to use chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu's words, their appearance at the commission is an exquisite example of how just being given the chance to tell it &quot;brings Christ's ointment into their hearts and souls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission is like a treadmill of truth. There is a tension between the need for succinct and well-organised information and the patience and time needed to help victims reorganise their basic understanding of what happened to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometimes, when there is a yawning gap between the need for caring on the part of commissioners and pressure to speed things up so the distressing business can get done for the day, its cathartic intent breaks down. So the Dubes of the struggle present the truth body with a formidable challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One needs to separate out the different needs and wants that victims have and also have a finer understanding of the various types of victims who appear before the commission. They are people with very different expectations,&quot; says Brandon Hamber, a psychologist at the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For some, reparations will be more important than the public hearings.  Various groups have raised different requests for compensation at the commission. Some have asked for welfare grants. Others want symbolic recognition in the form of tombstone or a moument. In the Eastern Cape there was a common call for help with the education of young victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The most profoundly worrying group is young people from the twilight period in the 1990s. Many of them probably played the role of victim, witness and perpetrator during the violence of the time. They are young and resentful and face a bleak future. It is hard to say how the commission will respond to their needs,&quot; says Hamber.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The truth commission could be paralysed by being forced to operate like a normal court after the Cape Supreme Court's decision this week to allow retired policemen access to truth commission documents, lawyers said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They said the decision could set a precedent which opened the gap for other judgments to order the commission to cross-examine witnesses - a move which would slow down the commission's proceedings considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge E King on Tuesday ordered the Truth and Reconciliation Commission not to hear any evidence affecting the two policemen - retired police Brigadier Jan Abraham and retired General Nicolaas Jacobus Janse van Rensburg - until they had been given advance warning of any evidence which might implicate them. The policemen were also granted access to the commission's documents.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers, who cautioned they had examined the controversial judgement, said it appeared the policemen and others could now seek interdicts ordering the commission to gag or censor witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In letters to the policemen, the commission has alleged that they were connected with the disappearance or poisoning of someone in Port Elizabeth in 1981. Sapa reported Judge King said: &quot;This is a test case and if it has far- reaching implications then so be it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One prominent constitutional lawyer said the judgment appeared to have struck a balance between ensuring the commission carried out its exposure of apartheid's horrors as dictated by the interim Constitution, and protecting the right of individuals not to have their reputation assaulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that although the Cape Supreme Court decision set an important precedent, it did not mean that other provinces could not take a different line. There was also a chance the commission could appeal against the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another lawyer said there was a danger the decision set a precedent which would make the commission function like a court, slowing down its proceedings considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He pointed to the ominous reaction to the judgment by four former national police commissioners, who warned the commission that it would be hit with similar court applications if it did not allow the cross- examination of witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mike Geldenhuys, Johan Coetzee, Hennie de Witt and Johan van der Merwe told Sapa: &quot;The way in which members and former members of the police have been placed in a bad light by some vague allegations, generalisations, hearsay evidence and apparent untruths cannot be tolerated any further.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legislation which set up the commission does not stipulate that witnesses should be cross-examined and it provides witnesses with a qualified privilege. This gives them a defence to defamation providing their evidence is not motivated by malice and providing it reflects their honest belief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge King's judgment, which was still being examined by the truth commissioners at the time of going to press, is not the first legal challenge to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month the families of several leading apartheid victims sought an interdict against the commission's amnesty committee, arguing that the granting of amnesties violated their constitutional right to civil actions against their relatives' killers and torturers. Judgment in this case has yet to be given.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's dream of a museum near his birthplace - Qunu in the Eastern Cape - has been given the green light, and should open to the public early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The museum is not intended as a shrine or a living monument to the president - its primary purpose will be to display gifts he has received over the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the gifts have been crated and stored at his house in Houghton, Johannesburg, but by the end of this year they will find a new home at a government museum.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela insists on receiving every offering on behalf of the people of South Africa. He regards none of them as his personal property. Yet many are chosen to appeal to him personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A boxing glove signed by Mohammed Ali and George Foreman was no doubt intended for a man who enjoys the sport, rather than a gift to all South Africans. But it could quite likely end up displayed at Qunu for all to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela has charged Deputy Environment Affairs and Tourism Minister Bantu Holomisa with the task of paving the way for the construction of the museum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Holomisa held a meeting in Qunu last month to raise the plan with the community and ask for assistance in choosing a site. More than 500 people attended, including all the headmen of villages in the area, Eastern Cape government officials, the Qunu Reconstruction and Development Programme committee, non- governmental organisations, and representatives of the University of Transkei and local schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I informed them that the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology and the Department of Public Works have been assigned by your office to the build the museum in Qunu,&quot; Holomisa reported to Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The building of the museum would no doubt lead to spin-offs such as tourism and small industries. The meeting felt that the tourism potential and environment must be considered by the local people of Qunu and that any site chosen for the museum must cater for these needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The meeting accepted the proposal to build the museum in Qunu. The site is being looked at by a committee composed of Qunu residents.&quot; The most likely spot is on the crest of a hill overlooking Mandela's birthplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela donated R150 000 to the community which has yet to do decide how to spend it. It will most likely be used for a satellite project near the museum which will cater for tourists visiting the installation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Public Works representative Wiseman Khuzwayo said the follow-up meeting between his department and the Qunu committee had not yet been organised.  Officials were still formulating a proposal to put to them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - As SABC's radio division prepares for a major relaunch, staffers complain of burgeoning bureaucracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE departure of three senior SABC radio executives could not have happened at a worse time for the government broadcaster's radio division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Set to relaunch itself amid ongoing internal problems and looming competition from independent radio stations, the last thing the division needs is a spate of resignations, say a number of discontented members of the corporation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAfm head Jack Mullen, an internationally recognised radio playwright; Coen Gous, dynamic head of the advertising division, Radio Active; and Radio Xhosa manager Tembela Mhlengi have quit the service within days of each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resignations will compound problems for the station gearing up to relaunch itself with fanfare in October. Staffers complain of a lack of leadership and burgeoning bureaucracy of both the &quot;old&quot; guard and the &quot;new&quot;, which hinders the transformation of the division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The division is imploding on itself. It has not transformed properly.  Nor is it capable of meeting the competition which is about to hit it,&quot; commented one insider who asked not to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six of the SABC's regional stations are being sold and by the end of the year 12 new private radio stations could be up and running in direct competition to the public broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite a government grant of R40-million to the corporation to get educational programming for radio and television, neither departmental heads nor staff were in place to meet the July deadline. But, radio chief Govin Reddy said the three education positions will be filled shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reddy said management was &quot;very excited&quot; about the &quot;repositioning of several stations&quot; in October, which would signal new names and programme content for the language stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike staffers who responded with shock to the news of the three resignations, Reddy was sanguine, saying the resignations were &quot;not really significant. We have 23 stations and only two station managers have resigned in the two-and-a-half years I've been there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reddy said the resignations had to be seen in their individual contexts: Mullen resigned for &quot;a change&quot;, but was still committed to the SABC, and Mhlengi resigned because of a dispute with staff and unions at the station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mullen told the Mail &amp; Guardian he was leaving because he &quot;had had enough of being in management&quot;. He said he was not a &quot;natural manager&quot; and wanted to return to creative writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colleague Talk at Will presenter Will Bernard said it was time &quot;management saw the difference between managing the editorial and managing the administrative side. Creative people should not be spending their days in meetings discussing the colour of carpets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - While labour analysts say the strike this week by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) was &quot;relatively successful&quot;, some are questioning why the federation opted to avoid any direct conflict with the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1,6-million-strong federation embarked on its first large post-apartheid strike since the 1994 elections and displayed its ability to muster support among workers. Cosatu's determination to publicly demonstrate that it is answerable to its constituency, as against pandering to the government's political needs, was also relatively successful, analysts said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Cosatu claimed 75% of worker support for the stayaway, it appeared that only a small proportion of the federation's backbone - the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) - took part.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Publisher of the Innes Labour Brief, Duncan Innes, said the NUM's relatively low support - estimated at around 10% - was &quot;not altogether surprising. Most of Cosatu's support in the mining industry comes from workers who are from Lesotho and Mozambique, and for whom issues relating to the South African Constitution are not that relevent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An editorial board member of the Labour Bulletin, Karl von Holdt, said the strike had proved that the federation is still in touch with its rank-and-file members, in the face of allegations that the federation is weakening and has a withering support base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Von Holdt said while Cosatu's decision to focus solely on the lockout clause in the workplace was an incentive for workers to support the national strike call and favoured Cosatu in its efforts to spur a large part of the workforce in a short space of time, the federation was cautious not to pick up on issues that are too closely linked to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of proportional representation, as opposed to a constituency system for voting, for example, was not flagged as a major strike demand.  Cosatu is opposed to proportional representation, but it is favoured by both the ANC and the National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some labour observers argued that Cosatu could not outrightly challenge the ANC on the issue of proportional representation because it would not be in the federation's interests to try to get the ANC's public support on a political, rather than a labour, issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike was, therefore, cautiously played by Cosatu because it did not want to challenge the ANC outright and because it also needed the ANC's tacit support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the event, the ANC's support proved that the alliance between the two bodies is not floundering, but it also highlighted Cosatu's cunning in focusing on labour-related problems, rather than political issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is speculation that Cosatu and the ANC agreed on a trade-off, according to which the ANC would publicly support the strike as long as Cosatu did not challenge it on the issue of proportional representation, the property clause and other unresolved constitutional clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some analysts said the federation had no choice but to focus on labour issues because this is the area in which Cosatu can successfully gather workers' support. Others argued that the deliberate sidestepping of proportional representation - which Cosatu would in fact rather have phased out of the Constitution - was &quot;conspicuously not the focus of its strike&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Von Holdt argued that the federation was careful not to choose issues closely linked to the ANC, but at the same time it was asserting itself and making it clear that it can be agressive about its independence. &quot;There is caution on the part of Cosatu as to how far it can push the alliance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Von Holdt also dismissed claims that Cosatu may have been merely posturing, adding that the federation was making its independence felt among the alliance partners and at the same time demonstrating the strength it still holds among the workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Innes said the strike was focused around issues that were of direct interest to workers, but that this did not necessarily mean &quot;the federation is losing sight of other issues. The strike being centred around the lockout clause was central to Cosatu's constituency and was therefore the issue which was most suitable to mobilise workers around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that Cosatu &quot;clearly feels that its views are not taken seriously&quot;, and is therefore intent on continuing with the protest even if agreement is reached on the lockout clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Innes said he believes behind-the- scenes negotiations will see Cosatu dealing with all the contentious issues, including that of proportional representation, and not continuing to focus solely on the lockout clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour analyst Gavin Brown said the strike had more to do with the federation's &quot;organisational problems&quot;, and was a &quot;theatrical performance&quot; to display Cosatu's support around a convenient issue - the lockout clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The strike was an exercise directed at Cosatu's internal workings and weaknesses and an attempt to underline their strength and ability to mobilise,&quot; Brown said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whether or not it has any real effect on the clauses in the Constitution, we will have to wait and see,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - One judoka, six cyclists and 18 track and field athletes were added to the Olympic team for Atlanta at an announcement by the National Olympic Committee of South Africa (Nocsa) in Johannesburg on Thursday. The only surprise among the new team members was the omission of race walker Chris Britz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was a controversial member of the original 19-strong squad of athletes selected by Athletics South Africa after the national championships two weeks ago and forwarded to Nocsa for ratification. Four marathon runners and pole vaulter Okkert Brits were named in the team earlier in the year.  Britz was the only athlete not to have reached an &quot;A&quot; qualifying standard for Atlanta while several athletes who had achieved the required mark were left out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa's two-tier selection policy provides for anyone who is likely to reach the semi-finals as well as a developmental component for young athletes who can be expected to feature prominently in future Olympics and will benefit from the exposure in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Nocsa president, Sam Ramsamy, accepted that ASA nominated Britz in good faith based on its belief that he could finish in the top 15 in the 20km walk, Ramsamy said that only &quot;A&quot; qualifiers could go to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two other athletes, javelin thrower Philip Spies and hammer thrower Roumen Koprivchin, had been given until June 30 by ASA to prove their fitness and achieve the Olympic &quot;A&quot; qualifying mark. Nocsa agreed that athletics should be given two more places but attached strict conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The athletes concerned must achieve an &quot;A&quot; qualifying standard; must be capable of reaching the semi-finals or the top 16 in the case of a straight final; must be fully fit according to Nocsa's specifications; and must have complied with all the regulations of ASA and the International Amateur Athletic Federation. These conditions must be met by June 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nocsa's offer will throw a lifeline to Britz who will race next week in Eisenhutt near Berlin, which is one of the world's fastest race walking circuits. Eisenhutt attracts the world's best race walkers and three of 1995's top six times were set there. If Britz is to go under the 1:23:20 time he needs he could not have chosen a better race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the South African championships in Cape Town two weeks ago Britz lowered his own national record to 1:24:36 but hit a bad patch in the second half of the race and also had to race on his own. &quot;I was very frustrated afterwards because I lost concentration at around 13km.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I lost about 20 seconds a kilometre over the following three kilometres which would have put me very close to the qualifying time. My training has been going very well though and I think I can reach my goal in Germany,&quot; said Britz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The irony for Britz, however, is that, although he has never been close to the &quot;A&quot; standard, his time from Cape Town would have placed him 11th at last year's world championships in Gothenburg where the course was much quicker. It was for this reason that Britz was included in the team by ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There certainly is merit in selecting athletes with &quot;B&quot; standard qualifiers in the less popular events like race walking because these events could die a slow death if participants aren't rewarded with the opportunity to compete in major championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But perhaps the best time to advance such a policy would be the world championships rather than the Olympics where the number of competitors is far more restricted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main dilemma for ASA is that 37 athletes achieved the &quot;A&quot; qualifying standard this year and many more did so last year. The qualifying period for Atlanta began on January 1 1995. Nocsa has made it clear, however, that it is not taking any holiday makers to Atlanta and it is up to ASA to ensure that the best athletes go to the Olympics in the quota it has been given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Athletics is a relatively simple sport to analyse in terms of the marks achieved by athletes providing the benefits of altitude are taken into consideration for the explosive events and adjustments made accordingly. The selection of any team is always controversial and although the athlete named so far constitute a reasonable attempt at ensuring the best go to the Games, there are some glaring anomalies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three athletes were chosen for the men's 400m while a further two 400m runners are in the team as members of the 4 x 400m relay team. However, if accepted conversions for performances at altitude are taken into consideration, not one athlete would have made the 400m qualifying time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty-year-old Hendrik Mokganyetsi and even Arnaud Malherbe (23) could be considered as athletes for the future but the same cannot be said of 28-year-old Bobang Phiri. All three will certainly have to improve on current form to have a chance of reaching the semi-finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also unlikely that any combination of the five athletes selected will be able to string together the close to 45.25 seconds per leg required to reach the final of the relay in the absence of the injured Riaan Dempers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If a relay team must run in Atlanta then why not use the three athletes in the 400m together with 400m hurdler Llewellyn Herbert. Ferrins Pieterse, who should already be in the team, could also form part of the relay squad and the two athletes who are only going to Atlanta for the relay could be left at home. Pieterse ran a sea level 49.41 in the 400m hurdles behind Herbert in Cape Town which is a full 0.63 seconds under the qualifying standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another athlete who should be in the team is pole vaulter Riaan Botha who has made the qualifying height of 5.60m three times this season. He was ranked equal 11th in the world last year with 5.80m and he would have made the final and finished eighth in Gothenburg with his three best jumps this year. He is only 25 and there is no justification for his omission, while 33-year-old long jumper, Francois Fouche, is in the team after qualifying only twice, both times at altitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allegations of favouritism towards Rand Afrikaans University athletes - the two most controversial selections, Britz and Fouche, are at RAU along with one of the three selectors who is also a race walking coach - have come from many athletes, but obviously this is just speculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventeen-year-old high jump sensation Hestrie Storbeck, who has twice cleared the qualifying height of 1.92m, is also unlucky not to be in the team. Javelin thrower Philip Spies has been over 80m twice this year and, as a member of the Olympic squad selected last October, has not even been aiming for a peak in the domestic season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For some reason he has been told to prove his fitness while the only thing that has been troubling him lately is a minor problem of shin splints.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Age may be the opponent that eventually beats even the greatest champions, but in Nick Faldo's case you suspect that it will have to go to the fifth hole of a playoff and then be made to sink a &quot;gimme&quot; put from five centimetres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on the 80 major championships between 1976 and 1995, Faldo, at 38, is already six years past the average age for winning one. But as he demonstrated at Augusta recently, he can do as much damage to statistics as he can to a game as accomplished as that possessed by the 41-year-old Greg Norman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the eight players who, since 1976, have won a major title at an older age than Faldo is now, Jack Nicklaus has done so three times, including claiming the Masters title at 46 (two years short of the oldest age for winning a major), and Ray Floyd twice. Gary Player, Lee Trevino, Larry Nelson, Hale Irwin, Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw are the others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If you look at those names, they're the cream,&quot; said Alex Hay, the teaching guru and BBC commentator who was at Augusta. &quot;There are no 'flash' winners such as John Daly who came from nowhere to win the 1991 US PGA. These are all guys with the nerve to bite back even when they're getting on in years. It's the nerve, or edge, if you like, that goes first, and that means the putting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's nothing to do with power. Being able to get the ball in the hole from two metres is what deserts you as you grow older. Any fool can hit the ball two metres, but once you lose your nerve - the back of your left hand stops going forward and you get the twitch - you're in trouble. Tom Watson is probably the best example of someone who has lost his nerve with the putter.  It was all the press wanted to talk to him about after he missed the cut in Augusta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the moment, Faldo shows no sign of losing it. Norman may have been the best player at Augusta, but he fell when his nerve went. Faldo is nerveless. Each time he has won the Masters he has finished with a sub-70 round and that tells you something about him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is an age-related flaw in Faldo's game, Hay believes it is to do with body mobility, although the player has not helped this by putting on 8kg during a typically daunting winter training programme. &quot;Like Nicklaus, Faldo is thick-set, strong in the torso and there is a suggestion that his swing is shortening off which is why he and his coach have been working on freer movement. It's not easy though,. I watched him in practice in Augusta and his swing was free and full, but it tightened up again on the course.  There is a danger in this, although it is not nearly as bad as loss of nerve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact is Faldo is a special case. I see him getting better and better, and I wouldn't be surprised if in the next five or six years he doubles his tally of majors. He still has a large store of them in him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Jacobs, another of the game's great teachers and thinkers, believes that if Faldo does go on to win many more majors - a prospect he certainly does not dismiss, but one he is less sure about than Hay - it will be because of his temperament, which he regards as possibly less perishable than any he has known. &quot;To succeed in golf,&quot; says Jacobs, &quot;you need temperament one, technique two and physical strength three - in that order.&quot; He stresses the force of Faldo's temperament by saying that in his case it is &quot;number one, one, one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jacobs gets cross at the suggestion that Norman &quot;choked&quot; in the final round. &quot;Greg Norman is a very tough character,&quot; said Jacobs, &quot;and I'll be surprised if he doesn't win another major. But what you saw was an even better temperament than Norman's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Augusta is a very unforgiving course. Half a club out and you're in trouble. Norman was unfortunate to drop a shot at the first, while Faldo played a perfect round from the start. His technique and club selection were faultless. So were his two great strengths: his short game and his temperament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bernard Gallacher and Peter Oosterhuis know at first hand the pressures of the modern game, and appreciate the scale of Faldo's achievement as he approaches his fortieth year (he'll be 39 on July 18, the opening day of the British Open Championship at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes). Gallacher, three times Faldo's Ryder Cup captain, admits to being surprised that he came through as strongly as he did at Augusta, having suspected that failure of nerve which Hay identifies as the key to forfeiting the ability to win might have set in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &gt;From his own experience, Gallacher describes the condition as &quot;a medical problem for which there is no known cure&quot;, but he believes Faldo provided enough evidence at Augusta to suggest he had postponed that affliction's onset: &quot;He's obviously feeling very positive at the moment and you certainly can't rule out his winning majors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oosterhuis, who partnered Faldo to a famous six-and-five win over Andy Bean and Tom Kite in the 1979 Ryder Cup, sees Faldo's commitment as the salient characteristic in his enduring success story: &quot;After one or two major victories, it is easy to lose the motivation. But Faldo has retained the desire to practise and to maintain his physical condition. So long as he keeps it he'll keep on winning.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - A strong South African team is expected to win many medals at the Paralympics in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One group of South African sportsmen and women whose potential for gold is far greater than most of those who will go to the Olympic Games have received barely a mention as the hype around Atlanta steadily gains momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are South Africa's disabled athletes who will compete in the Paralympic Games in Atlanta 11 days after the Olympic closing ceremony.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa first sent a team to the Paralympics in 1964 when Tokyo followed the lead of Rome which, four years earlier, had become the first Olympic city to stage them in conjunction with the Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nine-strong team in Japan won nine gold, seven silver and three bronze medals yet even this feat was surpassed in 1968 when the Paralympics were staged in Tel Aviv after concerns about the altitude in Mexico City. It was in Israel that eight South African competitors recorded the highest medal count ever seen with their tally of 27 medals for an average of over three per athlete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international sports boycott eventually caught up with disabled sport and South Africa was excluded from the Paralympics in 1980. After an 11th-hour call-up to Barcelona they carried on where they had left off with eight medals from a team of 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year we can expect an even more impressive medal haul from the largest Paralympic team ever to leave these shores after 40 athletes were named last weekend to go to Atlanta. &quot;Obviously anything can happen on the day but everyone in the team is expected to be a real medal contender and will definitely make the final. It's a very strong contingent that is going to Atlanta,&quot; says Andy Scott, chef de mission to the team and vice-president of the National Paralympic Committee (Napcosa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has some real superstars in disabled sport and many of them are on the team. At the 1994 International Paralympic Committee (IPC) athletics world championships in Berlin South Africa won 20 medals and it is the track and field athletes who will form the largest group in the team with 18 places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among them will be former Northern Transvaal rugby player, Fanie Lombaard, who had his left leg amputated below the knee after an accident in training in 1993. He won the gold medal for the shot, discus and javelin in Berlin and broke two world records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shot putter Michael Louwrens is also a gold medallist and world record holder from Berlin but another of those expected to do well in Atlanta is newcomer on the scene Steyn Humphreys, who holds the world record in his disability category for the javelin and discus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seven-strong swimming team will include Tadhg Slattery who broke the 100 m breaststroke world record to win gold at the IPC world championships in Malta in 1994 as did the then 15-year-old, Jean-Jaques Terblanche, in the 200m individual medley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The only major championships attended by South Africa last year saw a team of 18 bowlers at the world championships in England earn 12 places for Atlanta. The stars of the bowls team in England were Deirdre Buller, Stephen Coleman and Ronnie Phillips who are all blind and each won gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Telkom has five years to connect four million lines. Can it meet the challenge of universal service without a substantial restructuring?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom is probably the most vilified of South Africa's parastatals. Seen as inefficient and bureaucratic, consumers' greatest frustration is the lack of an alternative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While cellular technology promised to provide an in-road into the telecommunications monopoly, it has failed substantially to address the issue of universal accessibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting White Paper, published in March, clearly calls for the broad-scale restructuring of the telecommunications behemoth by establishing a universal service and gradually liberalising the market structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Robin Brawn of the National Telecommunications Policy Project (NTPP) describes the process as essentially &quot;a fully inclusive and consultative battle between Telkom wanting to retain its monopoly as far as it can, while the alternative voices have been pushing in the opposite direction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The most crucial part of any restructuring exercise is to build and sustain consensus,&quot; says Minister of Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting Jay Naidoo. &quot;Not much attention has been paid to this issue in the past. Many of the vested interests in the restructuring process see trade unions as a hindrance, but I see them as an essential part of this solution.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The compromise position adopted in the paper has established a five-year period of exclusivity, in return for which Telkom has promised to roll-out services to the underserviced community, and effectively double the four million lines it has currently connected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present, Telkom connects</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 190 000 lines a year on average; its roll-out goal has never been accomplished elsewhere in the world. The question then is: how can this inflated and slow bureaucracy get it right?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Naidoo: &quot;We remain united and committed to roll-out infrastructure for the four million lines and in that regard we need an injection of capital, new technology and expertise to realise the objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Telkom wants a foreign strategic equity partner, both because it can then gain a foothold in the international playing field by associating itself with one of the leading global giants, and so that it can benefit from the sorely needed project management expertise of the potential investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate and sensitivities around the issues are heating up, as the legislation is due for cabinet consideration this month and will be tabled in Parliament in June. The cabinet reshuffle has not helped as Naidoo inherits the portfolio at a critical time, particularly in light of strong union opposition to any talk of transformation along these lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, however, suavely comments on his position as Telkom chairman: &quot;I have been here for a year-and-a-half, the challenges are obviously daunting, but it's very comfortable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A high-level meeting was held between Naidoo and Moseneke last week, with the aim of discussing a way forward on the transformation of the parastatal and related issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moseneke is, however, vague when it comes to programmes: &quot;While we fully agree with the White Paper, the devil is in the details.&quot; He points out that Telkom has already laid the plans for restructuring along its core business lines, and plans an extensive human resource evaluation and development drive, examining skills and qualities of employees along the new strategic objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His problem is clear: &quot;We have inherited over 16 000 workers; rationalisation is not just about numbers, but rather about creating high levels of efficiency through appropriate skills. It's about adding value, but we have no immediate plans to do anything dramatic. It is a process that must be negotiated through the unions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commentators in the field argue that in telecoms staff are measured according to lines. Thus, at current output levels there is an obvious need to rationalise staff, but if Telkom is to deliver five times its present capacity, then the staff numbers will be appropriate. But can Telkom actually deliver, especially under the proposed time constraints?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed Bill attempts to structure inter- related measures that will act as checks and balances in the transformation process. But the Bill only looks at the phased liberalisation of the market, and the social and developmental objectives of extending the telecoms service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question of monopolies will be addressed in legislation only after the National Framework Agreement is resolved. The intention of the legislation is to set up an independent regulator, which will monitor progress and work with a universal service agency and related fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The success or failure of the telecommunications transformation exercise will depend on the strength or weakness of the regulator, and the capacity of labour, management and government to rise to the challenge of universal service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Moseneke, the way out is clear. &quot;Eskom has been successful at making cheaper connections on such a large scale, because it built up excess capacity over the last 15 years - and built it on public funds. Telkom has not been able to do that; our relationship is traditionally skewed. Of 40-million South Africans only 10% are connected. We need to build a major trunk network, which Eskom already has.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moseneke points out that costing (an average R800 against Eskom's R35 per connection) of the service is partly a function of history, and partly a result of Telkom's relationship with suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If the rand continues to drop it certainly does not do us any favours.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He elaborates: &quot;At the moment, 80% of our revenue comes from 20% of our clients, doing local and international business. Only with a major network roll-out can we balance the tariffs, which are higher than they should be.  The key to an affordable and reliable service is more consumers, and in order to have a major network build-up, we cannot do it out of our own funds. We have a large number of interested partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the moment, Telkom has serviced R2-billion of its R11-billion debt, but while functioning at a profit, cannot raise the capital needed for the roll-out. &quot;Without the investment, Telkom is a dead duck,&quot; argues Brawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Moseneke sees the future of telecommunications as ripe for investment. &quot;We are only scratching the surface. Telkom is an appropriate platform into the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brawn agrees: &quot;The ramifications to the economy of a roll-out are huge.  It implies an immediate 2% bump-up of the gross domestic product.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo has to make some crucial decisions within the next few weeks. The hard ball is in the government's court, concludes Moseneke. &quot;It is up to our shareholders to make all the hard decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adds Naidoo: &quot;We are confident that we are making sufficient progress and will shortly be in a position to make a public announcement that will bury speculation around this issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - As demand for South African exports increases, mining houses can expect profits, but the consumer will be hard hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coal will be in short supply this winter as overseas demand soars and the rand makes foreign sales more attractive. Add to this the lulls in production enforced by heavy rains earlier this year and sharp price rises look inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While mining houses can expect sturdy profits, the South African consumer will be hard hit.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This may be the nest egg that coal marketer and distributor MacPhail so sorely needs to turn around its R2,9-million loss for the six months to end-December, but the true price rises cannot be easily passed on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, MacPhail itself intends to diminish its exposure to the local market. Says chief executive Paul McNaughton: &quot;It is one of our strategic objectives to increase our offshore presence and expand exports.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking from Zimbabwe, McNaughton said: &quot;With South Africa joining the rest of the world post-sanctions, demand for our coal has increased tremendously. Not surprisingly, local suppliers have tended to favour exports over the home market, but to date no one has run out of coal in South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNaughton said the company had made contingency plans for the winter.  MacPhail has purchased 30 000 tons of bituminous coal up front, which will be prepacked and distributed by Spoornet in high-sided wagons. These will be stored in sidings and released to strategic outlets as winter progresses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McNaughton said: &quot;We've also put in stocks at our depots because we want to prevent shortages. But it is going to be a close-run thing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his second trip to Zimbabwe within a week, McNaughton was in the process of negotiating a supply contract &quot;but I can't give you details yet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that another project on the books will be decided by end-June.  &quot;We're in the middle of a feasibility study for a R100- million sized coal terminal at Richards Bay. Aiming to serve a niche market, the terminal would handle between two and four million tons a year.&quot; This does not alter the overall capacity at Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT), however, as it is designed for bulk coal, not sized coal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem for the South African consumer remains price and availability. Pithead (at the mine) prices have risen by between 17% and 20%; transport costs are up 10 to 12% and then there's the labour component of packing and redistribution. McNaughton said: &quot;Coal has virtually achieved the same universal status as gold. Prices are international now and they'll be at least 15 to 20% up on last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eskom has seen a 4,7% increase in use, while Sasol's usage is up by 10%.  Sasol has its own mines and Eskom has tied collieries that meet its needs.  But even so, the pressure is on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African coal exports surged to a record 59,9-million tons in 1995, worth R6,5-billion. While this is a 9,5% increase on 1994's exports, Chamber of Mines' senior economist Roger Baxter said it had not kept pace with the 15% growth in seaborne coal trade across the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 90% of South Africa's coal exports are steamcoal and again, while this sector grew by 7%, it lagged far behind the overall international growth in seaborne steamcoal, up by 22% in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, South Africa exports coal to 36 countries, with almost 54% of its trade going to Europe and a further 35% sold to the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demand in Europe was subdued, because of economic slowdown and cheaper coal sources in North America. The US has been a significant swing supplier and while it has the disadvantage of higher sulphur content coals, most European countries have the technology to deal with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another problem looming for South Africa is the lack of capacity at RBCT. On current exports, it has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 396-million tons of &quot;excess&quot; capacity a year left. While work is under way to boost capacity to 63-million tons, another year of the same growth in trade would push the requirement to 64 171-million tons - capacity the port clearly does not have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Work at RBCT may cost about R10-million, averaging out at R3 per ton of annual export. It is possible to extend the stockpile and to build another ship loader, but the bigger plans for capacity of 69-million tons could cost R150-million to construct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even that would not be sufficient capacity if there was a further year's growth in trade of 9,5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exporting through Maputo is not necessarily the answer. While this would open up the coalfields of the Waterberg region in the Northern Province, the Maputo port will need a thorough - and costly - dredging and unlike RBCT, it is not owned by the coal suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extra railage costs mean Durban is also not a viable option for bulk coals, though it can handle about one million tons of sized coal a year. The answer has to lie in urgent construction of a new terminal at Richards Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to steam coal, South Africa exports low ash bituminous coal, which is used for certain metallurgical processes, chemicals and also for iron and steel production</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meeting the demands of those coal-hungry markets, while keeping the home fires burning, is a problem seeking a solution before winter sets in.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals said this week he feared lifting exchange controls because of the heavy &quot;pent-up demand&quot; in South Africa to invest abroad that had built up in the past 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talking about the rand's meltdown and the Reserve Bank's relationship with the government, Stals rejected the view that the rand's collapse had given him a good opportunity to abolish exchange controls. He said South Africa's gold and foreign exchange reserves were too paltry for him to &quot;open the taps all at once. A large outflow of funds in a short time could have a devastating effect on the exchange rate, interest rates and inflation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many economists have called on Stals to give a clear indication of his plans for unwinding exchange controls, which he has said will be a gradual process. Before scrapping the financial rand he spelled out what economic targets had to be met, injecting some certainty into the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hasn't done that this time. Fears that restrictions on residents would be unwound too quickly had encouraged the assault on the rand, he said.  The International Monetary Fund and many foreign investors had cautioned the Bank against a &quot;big bang&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the Mail &amp; Guardian he had no objection in principle to setting a timetable for the abolition of exchange controls linked to certain targets, but said this would have to be part of a thorough macro-economic restructuring programme from government, which so far has not materialised.  It was difficult to set a timetable as it was almost impossible to predict when there would be sufficient reserves to take the next step. In the meantime, he favoured gradual abolition as and when the country could afford it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals warned that the economy's many deficiencies - including a low level of saving, inflexible labour markets, uncompetitive industries and relatively high inflation - should not be exposed to a &quot;big bang&quot; scrapping of exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite his independence, which is enshrined in the constitution, Stals is in close contact with senior government officials and has a formal meeting with the finance minister once a month. &quot;In practice, however, we have much more regular contact. So far, with Mr Manuel, it has almost been on a daily basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals said changes in monetary policy were not discussed with anyone outside the Bank, and were, in fact, confined to members of the Governor's Committee of the Bank. However, he did discuss the state of the rand and the economy with the finance minister and other political leaders, so the change in the Bank rate last Friday did not come as a &quot;big surprise&quot; to them.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Raising interest rates may not be enough to save the rand. Government needs to define a firm strategy for growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the authorities finally moved to stabilise the battered rand, it was a case of too little, too late. If a hike in interest rates was the solution, the Reserve Bank should have given the market a short, sharp shock at the onset of the currency crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts agree the Bank had little alternative, but the economy will pay dearly. Growth expectations for this year have been hastily downgraded, while inflation, on the governor's own admission, is likely to hit double-digits again by the year-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past two years, South Africa has been basking in post-election euphoria. Within two months, foreign goodwill has all but evaporated and gloom is descending on local investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason, says Dr Peter Hilsenrath of Syfrets, is that the government lacks a clear economic strategy. &quot;Investors would prefer a market-oriented policy, but at this stage, any plan is better than none. The rand's slide is not just a vote of no confidence in the government, but also in the private sector. Concern is growing that the economy as a whole is not performing as hoped.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa can ill-afford to fight inflation at the expense of growth at this stage. Growth is on track for about 3% this year, but is unlikely to top 2,5% next - a far cry from the government's 6% goal by 1999. Instead of a benign and moderate slowing, expected before the rate rise, that downphase has now been speeded up, says Dr Ben van Rensburg, economist at the South African Chamber of Business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Blaming cabinet changes, exchange controls or the Cosatu strike for the currency's instability is to ignore the fundamental structural problems in the economy. Foreign investors, says Dennis Dykes, chief economist of Nedcor, will put up with anything as long as growth is strong - China is a perfect example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But government promises of a growth plan, as outlined by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki earlier this year, have yet to be fulfilled. Moss Ngoasheng, Mbeki's economic adviser, said the plan was still being worked on and no deadline had yet been set for its presentation. He discounted any link between the fall in the currency and the lack of a growth plan as &quot;very tenuous&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government is trying to please all the people all of the time, taking labour's side one minute, and business's the next. Says Van Rensburg: &quot;We are seeing glimpses of a strategy, but what we need is an holistic approach to macro-economic policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economists do not believe the one percentage point rise in interest rates will be enough to restore confidence in the rand. It should have been accompanied by a policy package, including a programme for asset sales and a timetable for lifting exchange controls, says Nico Czypionka, chief economist of Standard Bank. &quot;That would at least give the impression that the government has a plan, and satisfy market expectations. Instead, Manuel is merely following his predecessor's line. What we need is more imagination.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - After watching a two-hour performance by Shaggy, the Jamaican-born ragga performer, at the Standard Bank Arena in Johannesburg, I went home to listen to my old Bob Marley CDs. This was an attempt to find out when the defiantly clenched fist of Third World anthems like Get Up! Stand Up! had transformed into seemingly painful pelvic thrusts, guns and lyrics about getting out on the town, finding a woman and having your way with her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ragga is an off-shoot of reggae, where the music is stripped of most of its features, leaving only the starkly harsh drumbeat and a hard-driving bass guitar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While reggae of old was characterised by reasonably danceable tunes about a wide range of subjects, from smoochy love to hardcore musical guerrilla sorties, ragga seems to consist of a staple diet of hardcore sex - at least that's the impression I got from the antics on stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps I am an old conservative listener but I must say I wish that reggae had not changed into this sometimes truly disruptive, rebellious, sex-crazed teenager.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaggy is a true disciple of the musical genre, belting out songs like Boombastic - sampled from Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On but totally unrecognisable in its hard-driving beat. His antics on stage were truly amazing as he moved the lower part of his body in a manner suggesting that he might be possessed by the devil herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Performing to a reasonably sizeable crowd - the Standard Bank Arena was not packed to the rafters, but, as one music company PR-type intoned, maybe self-deludingly: &quot;Not a bad crowd for a Monday evening, ne?&quot; - Shaggy ran a marathon from the instantly recognisable songs, like Carolina, to ones so obscure they probably don't even get a response from the most alternative dance halls. In this endeavour he was accompanied by a truly competent band and backing singers who could move from the harsh ragga thing to very smooth renditions of old songs like Billy Paul's Me and Mrs Jones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If I seem disrespectful of the man's creativity, it might be because of my own ill- developed sense of music, for Shaggy was given one of the highest accolades for his musical abilities: he was awarded a Grammy this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the main sermon might have been led by the foreigner, the opening prayer was conducted by Boomshaka, who did a reasonably good job of warming up the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their township music, infused with rap and reggae traces, and their physiology-defying dance routines, showed a little snippet of the talent available here. The only problem for a conservative viewer is the absence of a band behind the performers. But performing to backing tracks seems to have become a legitimate part of the creative process, not only limited to drunken slurring at a karaoke bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shaggy's Boombastic tour hits Cape Town on Friday night at the Three Arts</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - When I review South African jazz, I'm often telephoned by some white, self-appointed fellow critic who informs me that what I'm writing about &quot;isn't real jazz, it's only township&quot;. The first New Notes concert last Friday at Johannesburg's Mega Music blew a loud and joyful raspberry at such racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concert provided one set from Zim Ngqawana's Ingoma, one from Keith Tippett's Mujician and one big-band set combining the two with a British and South African repertoire. Given the enormous influence refugee South African jazzpeople had on the British scene, it wasn't surprising how seamlessly the music - from highly melodic and tightly pre-arranged to out and out spontaneous - fitted together.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And because the concert was conveived as a whole (rather than the usual token curtain- raiser from South Africans), it provided a new frame for listening to the South African compositions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngqawana's Ingoma is a moveable feast of a band. For this outing it included Dennis Mpale on trumpet, Barry Olsen on trombone, Andile Yenana on keyboards, Herbie Tsoaeli on bass, Kevin Gibson on drums and Valerie Naranjo on percussion. The tunes were the reedman's familiar repertoire - Abaphantsi, The African Emergency Suite - but the arrangements have been considerably refined over the years. The transitions from melodic themes to free blowing and back were much smoother than on some earlier outings. These are no longer works in progress but polished compositions, long overdue for recording.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngqawana is supported by the quality of his sidemen; particularly, for this tour, a magic rhythm section. Young bass player Tsoaeli has emerged as a player of imagination and maturity; his development is also a tribute to the nursery for new jazz that the Bass Line club has become. Drummer Kevin Gibson was every bandleader's dream: strong enough to provide a spine; unobtrusive enough not to dominate. And Naranjo's dazzling percussion underlined the world music elements in the compositions without ever undermining their essential South Africanness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mujician's set moved further out. Pianist Tippett, reedman Paul Dunmall, bassist Paul Rogers and drummer Tony Levin offered a muscular half hour of work-gang music: calls and responses and percussive interplay, with gentler interludes hinting nostalgically at minor-key melodies. Since it was improvised music, it'll be different next time. The constants are the rapport between players, their musicianship, and the range of textures and colours their collaboration invokes. This was intensely involving music. Free jazz is only &quot;difficult&quot; if you're waiting for tunes to whistle, and forgetting that music is also about harmony and rhythm, teamwork and imagination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final collaboration set provided all these in spades, plus melodies for those who wanted them. The assertive voices were the reeds of Ngqawana and Dunmall; the lyricism came from Olsen's 'bone and Mpale's trumpet, and the compositions from Tippett, Ngqawana and Feza, plus Dudu Pukwana's lush ballad Be My Dear. And what was &quot;British&quot; and what &quot;South African&quot; became irrelevant: this was simply great jazz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But while South African music more than held its own on a world-class stage, some people clearly weren't listening. Quiet passages were punctuated by bellowing conversations from the bar. Naranjo's chant with shaker was the cue for the video men to emit deafening crackles as they fitted a light filter. Let's hope Durban and Cape Town have better manners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Notes is at the Bat Centre in Durban on May 3, and at the Baxter in Cape Town on May 4</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Hollywood came to town this week - in the form of Jean-Claude Van Damme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Van Damme, visiting South Africa this week to promote his martial-arts extravaganza, The Quest, has a problem: he's too cute, the sexiest of the holy trinity of Hollywood musclemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arnold Schwarzenegger reached his apotheosis as a cyborg in the Terminator movies: he looks like a cyborg, and if he actually turned into one, would anyone notice? Sly Stallone looks as though he's been flattened - there's no intelligent life in there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Van Damme? He's naive enough to make stupid publicity gaffes, and to tell a horrified journalist he'd like to climb all over her body. Well, she was horrified. A Cape Town woman touched him and fainted. Another woman offered his sponsors R10 000 for a five- minute interview.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Johannesburg premiere of his film, journalists jostled with thousands of fans. And there were no cosy one-on-one interviews for the press. We were taken in batches to ask questions under the watchful - I nearly said &quot;beady&quot; - eye of a beefy bodyguard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bad case of star behaviour? No. Van Damme is pretty much down to earth. He wears glasses in public. He's five foot 10, he giggles and, when he doesn't eat regularly, he's &quot;a pain in the butt&quot;. He &quot;loves the human body and reading about medicine, mental problems and all that shit&quot;. To call him naive is a compliment: &quot;Intelligence can be very dangerous. It's nice to be simple, you're happy, can enjoy stuff more easily than smart people who can smell and see everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he is smart: he doesn't watch martial arts movies. &quot;Honest to God, no!&quot; He prefers &quot;movies with heart and passion. I did low- budget movies that became so successful I wondered why people liked them. I'm lucky to be famous with such simple films.&quot; It's time for &quot;good stories and acting. Now I'm popular and more powerful in Hollywood, I can demand good scripts. I've paid my dues.&quot; He has.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Quest is goodbye to all that: it's his last martial-arts movie.  Thank God, some say. But naivety is the strong point of Van Damme's movies - there is something appealingly soft (cute?) about him. He's a kid's hero. A mother told me her children are mad about him, not Arnie or Sly. Will sophisticated films spoil Van Damme? Maybe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Quest could have been better - there wasn't enough time or money to film the whole script. It should have been a Braveheart, but Mel Gibson had 24 weeks to film that epic. Van Damme had much, much less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He wanted more scenes with the orphans he leaves behind in New York; he wanted the camera to zoom in on a star he looks at in Thailand where he's fighting to make money for them, and to zoom back so that viewers are with the kids again, wondering what happened to their saviour. This is the sort of &quot;vision&quot; he wasn't able to get and somehow he can talk about vision without sounding self- aggrandising. Fame, he says, isn't about being a star: it's just having fun making movies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the public think differently. After the premiere, a blonde, muscled, star-struck youngster who looked as though he had just stepped off a Californian beach wanted to know where the after-show party was. He wanted to be a film star. &quot;You and a hundred thousand others,&quot; I said grimly. &quot;My heart won't let me be anything else,&quot; he replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps stardom, or the thought of it, makes everyone a little mad. Amid all this, Van Damme seems pretty sane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Quest opens on circuit on May 10</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - Compulsory arts education for all school pupils up to Standard Seven is likely to be implemented by the beginning of 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national Department of Education is planning to publish guidelines early next year for arts curricula covering music, dance, visual arts and drama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new arts courses will be very different from the old, largely Eurocentric system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're going for the Africanisation of the arts and culture syllabus,&quot; says Farouk Hoosain, deputy director: education policy (arts education). He is not, he says, talking about Afrocentric art - &quot;that's a new form of jingoism&quot; - but a synthesis: for example, &quot;where you have sitar music infused with violin and the marimba&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're making sure the syllabus is as inclusive as possible, culture-fair and anti- bias. We want young people to create art products which reflect all the different cultures of South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Education Ministry is working with the ministries of Labour and Arts, Culture, Science and Technology on a plan to train enough teachers so that all pupils across the country will have access to at least one arts subject every year, and possibly two or three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because arts education has never been a priority - pre-1994, &quot;the arts were seen as disturbing and the potential for subversion was there, in drama and the visual arts in particular&quot; - there aren't enough teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are plenty of artists, traditional dancers, musicians and theatre people, and the three ministries hammering out the project are looking at ways of bringing them into the system, possibly with certification from the National Qualifications Framework, which will take experience and non-formal education into account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Never compulsory, arts education has nonetheless been taken seriously in some provinces. In KwaZulu-Natal, an extensive arts and culture programme is offered by the Education Department - everything from Zulu dance to visual arts. The Western Cape has long benefited from a community theatre and community arts tradition; just as well, as a spokesperson for the Western Cape Education Department confirms that all new spending is going for classrooms, not culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hoosain acknowledges the problem of priorities. &quot;There is a quantitative debate,&quot; he says. &quot;We need more classrooms. And we need better facilities.  But there's also a qualitative debate. And that says it doesn't matter where arts education is experienced. You don't require expensive instruments to study music, halls with wooden floors to learn to dance or fancy structures to do drama work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for the visual arts, &quot;it does a lot for the soul to be able to take the material from your environment and create uniquely African artifacts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any case, as practioners know, arts education is about more than aesthetics. &quot;Creativity,&quot; he says, &quot;risk-taking, problem- solving - which subjects will encourage and help us to transfer those kinds of values? It just so happens that the arts offer that kind of help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before arts courses can be made compulsory, assessment problems must be ironed out, for although one can test how well a pupil can act, or dance, or sculpt, &quot;how do you test the affective side? Form, structure and processes are important, but the experiential and affective side is what makes the arts unique. And we are interested not only in looking at form and processes but in allowing children to experience the arts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scheme represents a radical change. In the past schools had some access to arts subjects, but their facilities reflected the funds allocated per pupil according to race. In music, symbolically - and much of the time, in reality - white schools had pianos, coloured and Indian schools had recorders, and black schools relied on the voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once the department comes up with a syllabus, pilot projects will be put into place. &quot;By the end of next year, we should be able to say authoritatively 'we believe that this works and that doesn't work'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> l In Gauteng, a business plan for pilot projects in arts education was due to be handed in this week to the provincial departments of Education and Arts and Culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was drawn up by a task team operating under the Gauteng Education Department's Reconstruction and Development Policy Planning unit (RDPP) and Arts and Culture Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task team refuses to talk about costs because, says a spokesperson, these will change as departments look at the proposals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an ambitious business plan, with pilot projects in a range of activities, from management to teacher training to promotion of arts education generally. The team, which wants the pilots to start within weeks, has moved quickly. Questionnaires went out to 3 000 schools, universities, non-governmental organisations, technikons, teacher training colleges and arts centres in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What came back from the schools is a lot of interest in implementing arts education but a lack of skills or other facilities to do so,&quot; says Pid Mclarty, project co-ordinator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The training of teachers is one of the more innovative pilots proposed.  In addition to training in-service teachers, the task team wants to look at bringing working artists into the schools to help teachers teaching the odd module.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also an interest in drawing in, on a regular basis, &quot;artists with years of experience, like traditional dancers&quot;, says McLarty, &quot;who have been teaching informally but now need qualifications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promoting the idea of arts education in the schools won't be difficult, but among the public, the team believes there could be problems. They propose a campaign including workshops with communities and school principals, newsletters and a video. &quot;There needs to be a campaign to inform the community of the benefits&quot; - among them, vocational skills - &quot;and to get rid of some of the adverse myths; for example, that 'only girls dance'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scheme represents a radical change. In the past schools had some access to arts subjects, but their facilities reflected the funds allocated per pupil according to race. In music, symbolically - and much of the time, in reality - white schools had pianos, coloured and Indian schools had recorders, and black schools relied on the voice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also an interest in drawing in, on a regular basis, &quot;artists with years of experience, like traditional dancers&quot;, says McLarty, &quot;who have been teaching informally but now need qualifications&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promoting the idea of arts education in the schools won't be difficult, but among the public, the team believes there could be problems. They propose a campaign including workshops with communities and school principals, newsletters and a video. &quot;There needs to be a campaign to inform the community of the benefits&quot; - among them, vocational skills - &quot;and to get rid of some of the adverse myths; for example, that 'only girls dance'.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York - The leaders of China, Nigeria, Turkey and Kenya are among 10 world figures identified by the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists as &quot;Enemies of the Press.&quot; All are responsible for brutal campaigns against journalists and press freedom, as documented by CPJ in its ongoing monitoring of press freedom violations worldwide. The &quot;Enemies of the Press&quot; list is released annually on May 3, World Press Freedom Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heading the list for the second straight year is Abu Abdul Rahman Amin, the head of Algeria's rebel Armed Islamic Group, who claims responsibility for many of the 58 assassinations of journalists in Algeria since 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Each of these 10 men is actively committed to the eradication of the independent press, &quot; said William A. Orme, Jr., executive director of CPJ.  &quot;&quot;Scores of working journalists were killed, imprisoned, or driven into exile as a result of their direct or covert actions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Enemies of the Press:<BR>1. Abu Abdul Rahman Amin, leader of the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria. His insurgent faction has claimed responsibility for many of the 58 assassinations of journalists in Algeria over the past three years. Rahman Amin has threatened all secular journalists with death. &quot;Those who fight with the pen,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot;shall die by the sword.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. China's leader, Deng Xiaoping. China's nonagenarian strongman may no longer run his government on a daily basis, but his ruling philosophy-&quot;socialism with Chinese characteristics&quot;-continues to serve as a pretext for the complete suppression of independent reporting. When it takes over Hong Kong in June 1997, Deng's regime is expected to muzzle one of the most vibrant and pluralistic news centers in all of Asia. As the man who ordered the June 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, which included the imprisonment of China's leading journalists, Deng is directly responsible for restricting the press freedom rights of more than one-fifth of the world's population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Nigerian President Sani Abacha persecutes independent journalists by ordering or encouraging editorial office bombings, seizures of periodicals and equipment, and the arbitrary detention of journalists, often without charges. One result is a steady stream into exile of the profession's best and brightest. For those who stay, the risks are great: in 1995 four journalists were sentenced by a secret military tribunal to 15 years in prison for reporting on dissident army officers accused of plotting the overthrow the regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Turkey's Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz runs a government that at any given moment holds more journalists in jail than any other in the world.  Yilmaz has done nothing to improve on his predecessor Tansu Ciller's dismal press freedom record. At the end of 1995, CPJ documented 51 cases of Turkish journalists who were then in jail simply for exercising their profession.  Most were imprisoned for reporting that was allegedly sympathetic to the Kurdish cause. Despite international criticism, Yilmaz has so far chosen to retain and enforce the notorious Articles 7 and 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and Article 312 of the Penal Code, which effectively criminalize independent news reporting about separatist movements, army counterinsurgency tactics, Islamic fundamentalism, and other topics central to the country's political life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Tajikistan's President Emomali Rakhmonov. President Rakhmonov has overseen the systematic elimination of independent Tajik news media. The paramilitary forces he commanded during the recent civil war were responsible for many of the 27 death-squad killings of journalists between 1992 and 1994.  All independent local news organizations have been forced to close, and hundreds of Tajik journalists are in hiding or in exile. The repressive Rakhmanov regime is wholly dependent on Russian military and economic aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Indonesia's President Suharto. President Suharto has orchestrated a two-year-long crackdown on the country's independent press. After banning three leading newsweeklies in June 1994, his regime brutally suppressed demonstrations by journalists and others against the closures. Last September, the leader of the only independent journalists union, Ahmad Taufik, and his colleague Eko Maryadi were sentenced to three years in prison for publishing an unlicensed magazine and supposedly subjecting the government to &quot;hostility, hatred, and contempt.&quot; At least 80 members of Taufik's union, the Alliance of Independent Journalists, have been fired from their jobs due to government pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. Cuba's President Fidel Castro. Cuba remains the only country in the Americas without any independent publications or broadcasters. Reporters not employed by state media are not allowed to own or operate a computer or a fax machine. Independent local journalists who attempt to send news dispatches to clients abroad face such retaliatory measures as internal travel bans, overnight detentions , the harassment of friends and relatives, seizures of equipment, and threats of prolonged imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. Saudi Arabia's King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Ibn Saud. King Fahd uses his enormous financial and diplomatic clout to silence dissenting voices not just in Ryadh but throughout the Arab world. The Saudi press, though privately owned, is one of the most restricted in the world. King Fahd must approve the hiring of editors; he also can (and does) dismiss them at will. More disturbing still, the Saudi royal family has acquired the most important international Arab periodicals and broadcast outlets and uses its influence to suppress all criticism-indeed, all serious examination-of its business interests and diplomatic entanglements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi. President Moi has declared war on the independent press and widened his net to include foreign correspondents.  Critical coverage of Moi has been decreed a criminal offense, while newspapers and printers have been arbitrarily closed for publishing opposing viewpoints. Journalists covering the trial of human rights activist Koigi wa Wamwere were physically attacked by pro-government thugs. The government last year introduced a restrictive new press law, including government-mandated &quot;codes of conduct&quot; for journalists, only to withdraw the initiative in the face of fierce international condemnation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10. Slovakia's Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. In his latest assault on press freedom, the thin-skinned prime minister pushed through parliament an amendment to the Criminal Code that would imprison journalists and others found guilty of &quot;spreading false information abroad.&quot; Since Meciar dismissed all but one of the 18 members of the state radio and television supervising councils in November 1994, the Slovakian broadcasters have become mouthpieces and apologists for the prime minister's increasingly autocratic rule. This backslide into repression bodes ill not only for Slovakia but for all of post-communist Central Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Committee to Protect Journalists documents and responds to press freedom abuses around the world. CPJ works to get detained journalists out of jail, directs international campaigns of protest against repressive governments, and provides practical safety information to reporters assigned to dangerous areas. CPJ is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization financed wholly by donations from individuals, private foundations, and news organizations. More information about press freedom in more than 100 countries can be found in CPJ's annual report, &quot;Attacks on the Press in 1995,&quot; available on CPJ's new World Wide Web site, http://www.cpj.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Opposition UNIP and the Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) yesterday lost their bid in the Lusaka High Court to have the contract between the government and Nikuv Computers Limited, declared &quot;null and void&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a highly disputed judgment, described as &quot;timid&quot; by opposition parties, High Court commissioner Bonaventure Mutale, reluctantly declined to nullify the contract and the voters' register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Mutale could also not declare the US$18 million contract null and void because there was nothing in the appendix or the contract describing what the company was contracted to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his judgment, commissioner Mutale found that although the exercise was fraught with irregularities, both in the employment of electoral officers and in the registration of voters, he was reluctant to declare the contract null and void. He stated that he found it difficult to nullify the contract when government had already paid US$6.87 million in tax payer's money and which action he felt would be disruptive to the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;By this point the reason to quash it is unsuccessful,&quot; read Mutale in his two hour judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mutale also found that Nikuv was not registered in Zambia but said no evidence was adduced as to whether it was registered outside Zambia or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He agreed with the two applicants on this but said it was not enough to warrant the nullification of the contract because such an omission could only attract a criminal offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He instead advised the registrar of companies and the Director of Public Prosecution to prosecute Nikuv Computers Limited officials for flouting the country's laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commissioner further agreed with the two applicants who argued that under the Constitution and the Electoral Act, the duty to register voters solely rests with the Electoral Commission and that the function cannot be delegated to the second respondent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Mutale, however, found that the Electoral Commission had done the registration of voters and had not abdicated its role. He said Nikuv was merely inputting data and later the production of voters cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Mutale also agreed with the two political parties that it was wrong for the government to attempt to exclude the courts as they did in section 29 of the contract and to classify the contract as &quot;secret&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Although the contract was treated as classified 'secret' by the first respondent I lastly make no order to nullify it,&quot; commissioner Mutale ruled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reacting to the ruling soon after judgment was delivered, Liberal Progressive Front leader Rodger Chongwe blamed judges for their timidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The judiciary is its own casualty until such a time they are ready to stand up for the people,&quot;Chongwe charged in an interview yesterday at the Lusaka High Court . &quot; It is not enough to say there is interference from the executive when judges fail to make a judgment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chongwe added: &quot;It is not interference from the executive, it's the timidity of judges. It is sad that even lawyers in private practice fear standing up for the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And UNIP secretary general Sebastian Zulu, the second applicant in the matter, said the judgment clearly showed they had won the case because the court had found that registration was fraught with irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The judge found that officers were appointed in their official capacity instead of by name as individuals,&quot; Zulu said. &quot;Once he finds this it means that what they have done is null and void because they have no power to register.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zulu dismissed commissioner Mutale's argument that the money spent persuaded him not to declare the register null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Consideration of money spent is absolutely irrelevant. If there is chaos in this country would you value it at $6 million?&quot; Zulu asked. &quot; What has money spent got to do with law when an act is illegal?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another lawyer who listened to the judgment said: &quot;It's obvious that there is a lot of pressure on the judges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And immediately after commissioner Mutale's judgment, Nosiku Kawanambulu, representing UNIP and LPF, applied for a stay of execution of judgment pending an appeal to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioner Mutale who expressed his displeasure at the absence of the government lawyers set May 6 for the State's submission and his ruling on whether to stay the judgment or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I do not understand how they can stay away when the state was represented by the Solicitor-General on this matter,&quot; commissioner Mutale said, advising Kawanambulu to express his displeasure to the government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - Northern Breweries, the Copperbelt-based brewers of the popular Rhino lager and now awaiting privatisation are competing favourably on the beer market, though the company's profits are yet to be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surprisingly, its recently launched Rhino lager seems to be holding its own against Anglo American Corporation Zambia Breweries' Mosi . Unlike Mosi which is being brewed under the supervision of South African experts, Rhino is a product of the local 'boys' -- brewed in Zambia by Zambians for Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Privatisation is one of the ingredients of the Structural Adjustment Programme. Its aim was to sell the badly administered parastatals to private individuals who could concentrate on running a profitable business and not on creating jobs as was the case with the parastatals,&quot;said Muna Nakalonga, Coordinator of the Economics Association of Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Nevertheless, not all parastatals were badly run. ZESCO is a good example of a parastatal which maintained a steady pace. From what we can see of Northern Breweries, it is also doing well though it remains a parastatal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 1, two years ago Zambia Breweries was officially taken over by ZamAnglo Industrial Corporation, the Zambian subsidiary of the South African mining giant, Anglo American Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sale was on condition that the Lusaka brewery and the Northern division brewery in Ndola be split into two autonomous companies. Anglo had to forego their preemptive rights and sanction the government's decision to split the company when they were given a wholesome price of US$13 million for the Lusaka brewery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And from then on, the struggle for lager hegemony between the two companies was set in motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA), it was necessary to separate the two plants to ensure competition on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After privatisation in April 1994, Lusaka Breweries allowed Northern Breweries only 12 months in which to come up with their own brand name, labels and patent. August 27, 1995 was the deadline for Northern Breweries to stop brewing Mosi and using its label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In July 1994, ZPA finalised the transfer of Northern Breweries, formerly under ZIMCO, the then holding company of most state enterprises, to Northern Breweries PLc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Lusaka Breweries introduced new management from South Africa and halted production of a new beer, Kariba, deciding instead to invest $5 million to restructure its plant. But there were no retrenchments, as expected by the workers' union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 12 months, Northern Breweries on the copperbelt worked hard to introduce two new brands on the market, Ndola Supreme lager and Rhino, at a cost of over K1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And until one of Zambia's greatest entertainer and play actor Sauzande, in a television advertisement, told the public that he was &quot;Anaza&quot;, Rhino was clearly not a famous lager, especially outside the Copperbelt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it seems Northern Breweries when launching its two lagers, in July and August 1995, had problems identifying the social class that really matters for its brands to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At first, I thought it was a copyright advert! It seemed to be a beer for rich foreigners,&quot; said Esnart Tembo of Libala in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ndola Supreme lager, with 4.5 per cent alcohol content, was released on August 2, just after the launch of Rhino with same alcohol percentage. But at best, the launch of the two beers was described as lukewarm by experienced marketers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They could have taken advantage of the commercial shows on the Copperbelt which coincided with their product launches but they seemed to have lost grip of their market,&quot; said Paul Kaluba, a regional marketing manager with Coca Cola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think they had problems with distribution. Or maybe they were just learning to operate on the open market,&quot; observed Tony Equamo of Ndola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview in Ndola, Northern Breweries managing director Matthews Mulanda said all logistics had been put in place to ensure the brewery continued operations despite being severed from central breweries in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fortunately for Rhino, the government in an unprecedented move had cut excise duty on beer from 125 to 100 per cent in January 1995. Some businessmen believe the measure helped prop up Northern Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Otherwise they would not have survived the production costs after losing a viable market like Lusaka so suddenly,&quot; said Sunday Ngwenya of Mataela Bar in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, Mosi on the Copperbelt is rarely found in pubs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We can't afford Mosi at K600 a bottle. One 'Shakers' at K550 is enough for the two of us and when I make a bit of money, I go for Rhino at K500,&quot; said Jasper Mambilima, a Ndola Taxi Driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, Rhino is now awash on the Copperbelt and has amazingly managed to turn the tide of public opinion in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is very good beer and does not even leave you with a hangover in the morning,&quot; said Brian Mulenga of Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Northern Breweries managing director Mulanda said he had plans to increase beer output from 4.5 million to 9 million cases a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Mosi has also been vigorously campaigning for a share of their slipping market though from all accounts, they are barely holding on to the northern half of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Aah, there is no Mosi here. You can go to a hotel if you want Mosi,&quot; advised a sympathetic cab driver in the Ndola town centre on enquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What do you expect?&quot; asked Lusaka Breweries marketing manager Morris McClurg. &quot;A local brewery must be able to satisfy its customers. We do the same for Lusaka.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McClurg insisted that Chingola was still Mosi- prone though he agreed that the rest of the Copperbelt was leaning towards Rhino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the Lusaka brewery's production of Mosi had not reduced but remained the same as last year at 75 million litres a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Rhino is doing everything possible to stick to the K500 mark, Mosi has been coursing the price path and now sells at K650.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka Breweries management explained in an interview that the new Mosi prices are due to the high production costs as a result of increased taxation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But both companies declined to give details on the status of their balance sheets. They could only point to the amount of investment being poured into their companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Northern Breweries have received orders for weekly supplies of 2,000 crates of Rhino lager from a company called Jefcom Impex of South Africa.  Apart from that, the brewery has installed two boilers and plans to introduce plastic beer bottles and canned beer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But regardless of the notable progress made by Northern Breweries, ZPA chief executive Valentine Chitalu said the company was soon to be privatised and three buyers had been shortlisted. And ZPA sources said Lonhro might emerge as the likely winner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalists and the media in the region have not attempted to take keen interest in the many environmental problems affecting the people in order to bring awareness to their communities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opening an environmental reporting workshop for Southern African Development Community ( SADC) countries in Kariba on Monday, Zimbabwean deputy environment and tourism minister, Edward Chiringa, said environmental reporting by journalists in the region has been sacrificed for political news .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chiringa said the important subject of environment had been left in the hands of the foreign media which is not representing the correct position of the situation because they don't understand the local situation well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the more than 20 journalists from the SADC region that there was need to rework the journalism training programme so that environmental subjects are incorporated in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There should be a deliberate effort to incorporate environmental reporting in these training programmes,&quot; he said. &quot; The current situation is not encouraging.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The minister also challenged governments in the region to come up with appropriate measures to ensure that funds raised for conservation of the environment are properly safeguarded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lusaka - The Vice President, Brigadier-General Godfrey Miyanda disclosed in Parliament today that seven Zambians were shot by Namibian security forces, between January 1991 and January 1996 along the Zambia-Namibia common border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Miyanda said two cases involving the shootings at the border have been taken to court. He, however, assured parliament that the shootings have subsided mostly because of the 'good neighbourly' between President Chiluba and his Namibian counter-part, President Sam Nujoma and also through the Zambia/Namibia Joint Permanent Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Miyanda was answering a question from Sesheke Member of Parliament (MMD), Richard Nganga, who wanted to know what positive results have been achieved on the compensation of Zambians shot along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament heard that the three defunct banks owed the Bank of Zambia about K65.1 billion in overdrafts on maize marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finance Deputy Minister, Koshita Sheng'amo, said in Lusaka that Meridien Bank Biao, Commerce Bank and African Commerical Bank owed Bank of Zambia about K65.1 billion in total between January 1995 and December 1995. Mr Sheng'amo said Meridien Bank owed BOZ about K44.2 billion while Commerce Bank's debt was at K10.9 billion and K10 billion for the African Commerical Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr Sheng'amo also disclosed that about seven foreign banks were operating in the country from January to December last year. He said all the seven are still operating and non has been closed so far. The minister said the banks are Barclays, Standard Chartered, Stanbic, Indo-Zambia, Citi Bank, Cavmont, Inter-Market and the Discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About K8 billion was spent on the maintenance of the Zambia national team football players and officials during the Africa Cup of Nations competitions held in 1994 and 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sport, Youth and Child Development Minister, Leautenant-Colonel Patrick Kamfumukache, told parliament today that about K411,651,700 was spent on players and officials during the Africa Cup of Nations competitions held in Tunisia in 1994. Lt-Col. Kamfumukache said another K411,558,774 was spent on the players and officials during the Africa Cup competitions held this year in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Col. Kamfumukache said the team performed well in both competitions but were only unlucky to have taken the second and third positions respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A total number of 60 journalists resigned from the government owned media between January 1992 and January 1996 on account of poor salaries and deplorable working conditions and they left for greener pastures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Information and Broadcasting Services Minister, Amusaa Mwanamwambwa, told parliament in Lusaka today that 25 resigned from the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC), 10 from the Zambia Information Services (ZIS) and another 25 from the Zambia News Agency (ZANA). He, however, said that continuous dialogue has been progressing on ways and means of improving conditions of services in the three news organisations. He noted that the 60 journalists who resigned were mostly of degree and diploma holders who opted to work for the privately owned media in search of better incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence Minister, Ben Mwila, said nine military helicopters were destroyed by fire in the hanger at the Samora Machel Air-base in Mbala between January 1989 and December 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Answering a question from Member of Parliament for Mbala (UNIP), Yoram Chungu, the defence chief said the fire was caused by sabotage since investigations revealed that fuel tanks were left open to drip out. Mr Mwila said the government in the process lost a total of 7,120,000 United States dollars worth of property. He, however, refused to tell the House what measures were taken to prevent a future recurrence saying such defence matters should be left to be dealt with internally in the ministry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The following is a statement issued by the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) on the 24-hour general strike of April 30, 1996:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today several millions heeded the call by COSATU for workers to embark on a general strike and occupy the streets in defence of their constitutional demands. COSATU is overwhelmed by the positive response of workers to its call. Initial estimation shows that 75% of workers in major industrial areas heeded the call. This being the first general strike after democratic elections shows that workers are not prepared to leave their future and demands to only those they elected into parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike comes with the background of threats of dismissals, disciplinary actions, lock-outs, and blackmailing. The fact that workers ignored all these threats from anti working class forces comes as no surprise to COSATU. Even the last minute attempt by the big capital blue eyed boys in the form of Democratic Party's Tony Leon, who yesterday declared our strike illegal, could not deter workers' resolve to fight in support of their legitimate demands. COSATU once more demonstrated that it has an organisational capacity to mobilise workers within a short period of time if there is a need. The strike was announced on the 20 April 1996 and in 6 working days we were able to pull more than 325 000 workers in the streets of major towns with millions heeding the call for a strike. It is a tribute to workers that despite the transport and logistical problems they faced, so many were prepared to come to the cities. In Klerksdorp alone more than 20 000 workers in the mines were left stranded without transport. There are dozens of such examples across the country as in most townships there were no running trains and busses. (See attached details of members who attended different rallies.) We also attach a separate statement for SACTWU indicating the levels of support in the clothing and textile industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are particularly pleased that in true COSATU tradition, our strike was not accompanied by violence and intimidation. Despite the volatile situation in KwaZulu Natal, we were able to have a solid support from workers in that region. We are disappointed at the reported sporadic incidents of violence and intimidation in some of the townships in KwaZulu Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are reiterating our call to our members to remain on their toes for further actions as may be necessitated by the developments in the Constitutional Assembly. We are making a call to big business and National Party to drop their undemocratic demands. We hope that even at this late hour they shall review their current position and realise that our members together with the rest of the democratic South Africa shall not be held hostage by minority interests. We call on the African National Congress to stand firm on their positions and reject any clever formulation that will bring the principles on issues on dispute back on the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With regard to the lock-out clause, COSATU is interested in one thing - the removal of the entire clause. We will continue to reject any clever formulation that is intended to bring the lock-out clause in the constitution through the back door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We acknowledge the participation of NACTU and whoever else supported us in our marches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We call on employers who have threatened workers with lock-out action on the 03 May 1996 when they return, not to risk a chain of reaction by workers in defence of each other.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Summary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Estimated support for the strike among clothing, textile and leather footwear workers were as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Natal: 75 000 workers (85%) Eastern Cape: 20 000 workers (75%) Western Cape: 43 000 workers (57%) Gauteng/NW Prov 22 000 workers (85%) Free State/NCape 11 000 workers (70%)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all, about 171 000 textile, clothing and footwear workers took part in the strike. This equals 76% of the combined employment in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Below we set out some details. Note that the information covers only clothing, textile and footwear (CTF) workers, and is based on the latest available information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Natal:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Pinetown, 100% of members in the CTF industry took part in the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Durban clothing industry, the participation rate was 80 - 90%.  All the key factories closed down, including Frame, Romatex, Seardell and David Whiteheads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We estimate that the overall participation rate in the strike in the province for the CTF sectors was 85%. Accordingly, at least 75 000 workers from these sectors were on strike today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eastern Cape:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Port Elizabeth, 80% of the CTF industry took part in the strike, while in the greater East London area, it was 70%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We estimate that the overall participation rate in the strike in the province for the CTF industry was 75%. Thus abut 20 000 workers from the three sectors supported the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western Cape:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Participation in the strike varied greatly, from support of 10% up to 100% being registered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The textile workers largely supported the strike, and a number of large factories in the Boland, South Cape area and Epping closed down for the day.  Support in the clothing and footwear industry was more mixed. In the Atlantis area, about 80% of clothing workers supported the strike. In areas such as Salt River, support was much lower, with many factories reporting 30% support for the strike. Some workplace in Parow had less than 10% absenteeism. There were on the other hand a number of clothing factories in the Cape Peninsula area, including a number of small and medium enterprises, who closed down completely for the day and where support for the strike was 100%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given these large variations, we compiled figures from a sample of 75 companies covering all three sectors, and the clothing retail sector. We estimate that the overall participation in these companies was 57%. The earlier rate, released at noon today, based on a sample of 63 companies, was 65%. Based on the lower 57% participation rate, a total of 43 000 workers in the textile, clothing and footwear industry supported the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gauteng and North West Province:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Johannesburg, a 90% support was registered for the strike. In some of the decentralised areas, all workers observed the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We estimate a participation rate of about 85% for the two provinces, and thus 22 000 workers in the three sectors were on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Free State and N Cape:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Support for the strike was strong in Qwa Qwa, Kimberley and Botshabelo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We estimate a participation rate of about 70%. Thus about 11 000 workers in the three sectors were on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Preliminary figures released by SACTWU head office at 16h00 on 30 April 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg - The first Southern African International Film and Television Market which was scheduled to be held from 9 - 15 June, 1996 in Cape Town has been postponed to 13 - 17 November, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to move the market back a few months was taken by the Board of the Southern African Film &amp; Television Market Initiative (Section 21 Company - Association Not For Gain), based on the fact that the Market has grown far larger than anticipated with numerous ongoing enquiries from all over the world and, therefore, more fundraising and time, is essential to host this international event effectively. Other reasons include the fact that many international visitors are more in favour of a summer Market, given that many have location scouting on their agenda,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official Film &amp; TV Market office, by kind donation from the SABC, is now established and fully functional. Operational officers for this Market appointed by the Board include Gaby Keyser (Managing Director), Dezi Rorich (Market Director), Basetsana Thokoane (Director, Fundraising) and Carmel Adonis (Market Administrator). Chairperson of the Board is Richard Ishmail.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Objectives: Given the explosive growth of film and television production in Southern Africa, and the increasing global interest in this region, it is now essential to host a formal Market which will -- under one roof -- introduce a new world of filmmaking in what is rapidly becoming one of the most sought after production centres in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A priority is to open up dialogue not only internationally, but also with neighbouring territories in Africa, provide education and training through interaction and workshops with global film community, and develop new and young talent in the region.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * discover opportunities in one of the greatest film locations in the world</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * meet co-producing partners and exchange ideas with colleagues</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * exhibit product</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * view unseen product from the African continent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * learn about the changing face of the broadcasting industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * meet an emerging generation of filmmakers and discover their cultural expression</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Programme of the Market includes --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Business of Film - seminars covering Legal, Finance and Insurance topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *South Africa's 2nd International Media Exchange brought to the Market by Katrina Wood of the MediaXchange. A group of senior film and television professionals will discuss the mutual benefits of co-production and joint ventures with South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A Co-Production Market to provide contact between film and television makers and financiers, both for ideas in developing and finished product.  Sessions will be held each morning addressed by the visiting specialists concerning script development, financing and production, marketing and distribution, and secondary markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shorts Showcase - An opportunity for first time Southern African filmmakers to exhibit their films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Focus - This program will exhibit completed product from the African continent, which can proudly boast some internationally competitive motion pictures.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Marketing of the Market kicked off at the A.F.M. (American Film Market) where the response was extremely positive and key organisations pledged their support and involvement. The international Trades were all extremely interested in exhibiting for the first time in Southern Africa. The Market was also introduced at Screen Africa stand on the international Television Show in London, which so far has seen the greatest response from top calibre broadcasters, and film and television producers. Marketing continues at the current MIP Television Market in Cannes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Invitations are currently being issued to global film and television makers, distributors and producers, as well as representatives of international Film Commissions, Institutions and Industry Affiliates.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC - Beginning April 30, the Corporate Council on Africa delegation of American is leading businesses on a ten day trade and investment mission to Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Mission will be headed by senior executives of The Coca-Cola Company, Mobil Oil, AT&amp;T, Anadarko Petroleum, F.C. Schaffer and Associates, and Equator Bank Limited. The purpose of the visit is to expand the commercial relationship between the United States and these two African countries by forging solid business partnerships. According to both the Eritrean and Ethiopian Embassies in Washington, this is the largest trade delegation of U.S. executives to ever visit these countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eritrea, Africa's newest country gained its independence from Ethiopia in May 1993. Located strategically along the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa, this country of four million people is engaged in an effort to build a new national. Eritrea's economic development will be fueled by a combination of crude oil reserves, strategic minerals, and financing from the international community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eritrea possesses over 670 miles of coastline along the Red Sea. In addition to its mainland, Eritrea is made up of over 350 islands in the Red Sea, of which 210 comprise the Dehalak Archipelago. In close proximity to the Middle East, tourism in this region of Eritrea is rapidly growing, offering many opportunities in the hotel and tourism industries. The natural deep-water harbor in Massawa will permit Eritrea to serve as a gateway of goods for East and Central Africa, and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia, making a strong recovery after twenty one years of totalitarian rule, is aggressively seeking to reclaim its place as one of Africa's wealthiest nations. Possessing Africa's second largest market with over 60 million people, Ethiopia is poised for a period of rapid economic growth that will be fueled by its agricultural and mineral wealth, as well as a bold initiative to build a modern network of roads and transportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ethiopia possesses trade and investment opportunities n almost every commercial sector. The development of strategic mineral deposits such as gold, platinum, marble, copper, and potash, as well as expanded agricultural production, will place huge demands on Ethiopia's infrastructure which will need to be completely modernized over the next decade. Demand from the Ethiopian consumer, who is expected to benefit from Ethiopia's new policies of economic and political liberalization, will create opportunities in a broad range of industries, from electronics and construction materials to basic consumer and health care products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other American companies and individuals participating on the mission include: Adeemera Enterprises, Inc., Allied International Marketing Corporation, Bay Area World Trade Center BTB Trading Carson Services, Inc., Development Concepts, Inc., Eli Lilly &amp; Company, General Motors Corp., Global Business Access, Ltd., Hebret, Inc., Honeywell, IBEX Group, International Wireless Incorporated, ITEPS Limited, Inc., Mid-West Textiles, Inc., MWI Corporation., Navistar International, Pegasus Gold Corp., Mr. Jeffrey Prosser, SEAIR Transport Services, Inc., Spatial Data Institute, Standard Commercial Tobacco Co., State of Georgia, Takeze Production, TDC Energy, The Westar Group, Towill, Inc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The corporate Council is a non-profit organization of over 90 American businesses and individuals whose goal is to promote policies in both Africa and the United States that will build and strengthen the African private sector. To this end, the Council is committed to working with the governments of Africa and the United States, as well as the African private sector, to improve the trade and investment climate in Africa, and to increase the commercial interaction between the American and African private sectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council believes that the growth of jobs and new enterprises in Africa will form the foundation for Africa's economic development. By fueling economic growth, new trade and investment in Africa has the potential to contribute, ultimately, to the material well-being and prosperity of the African people. In simple terms, the Council believes that profitable U.S.  commercial involvement in Africa will create jobs and begin the cycle of building a market on this continent of approximately 600 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Corporate Council on Africa was founded in 1992.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - The following statement was issued by participants in an April 26 march from the White House to Capitol Hill by several thousand Liberians and others in support of peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We, Liberians residing in the United States of America, representing a cross section of our people, along with our international friends, are gathered in Washington, D.C. for a peaceful demonstration. This represents the largest gathering ever of Liberians in the United States, united with one voice, petitioning the American Government to assist our country in its darkest hour of peril.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have come in unity and solidarity to express our profound appreciation and thanks to the international community, especially the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Organization of African Unity(OAU), the European Union, the United Nations and the United States of America as well as many non-governmental organizations, for their continued efforts toward ending the Liberian civil war. This civil war, which has been raging over the past six and a half years, has claimed the lives of nearly 200,000 people, mostly defenseless civilians, and created approximately two million refugees and displaced persons. These tragic developments have devastated the entire country and its already fragile infrastructure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long suffering Liberian people have worked strenuously and steadfastly in pursuit of, and maintained a spirit of hope for, a peaceful resolution of the conflict, but peace continues to elude them, despite the numerous peace accords which the warring factions have signed over the past six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These accords have resulted in the formation of several interim governments, either with the consent of, or controlled by, the warring factions, but have failed to end the war and bring peace, primarily because the said warring factions have consistently and defiantly violated the terms of these agreements with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace-keeping force ECOMOG, which was sent to Liberia by ECOWAS leaders in 1990, continues to make great and supreme sacrifices. But inadequate funding, manpower and logistics have compromised ECOMOG's ability to implement its mandate of peace-keeping and enforcement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are cognizant of the fact that Liberians in the USA have heretofore failed to present a united front with a common message on the Liberian crisis. This failure has contributed in part to the prolonged crisis, which has resulted in the near annihilation of our people, the massive and widespread destruction of our country, the utter humiliation of Liberians and the looming dissolution of Liberia's sovereignty. It is for these urgent and compelling reasons that we have come to express the sentiments and desires of the majority of our people in Liberia, Africa, the United States and other parts of the world, who are crying for and demanding peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are aware of the swift and decisive action which the United States Government, in the wake of the latest crisis, has taken within the past several days, in deploying a contingent of troops on the ground Monrovia, and providing $30 million for material and logistical support for the peacekeeping operation. We are also aware of the high-powered delegation, headed by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State William Twaddell, which the Clinton Administration has sent to Liberia to work with ECOWAS and the combatants in the search for a lasting solution to the crisis. From the depths of our hearts we extend to President Clinton and the American Government and people our gratitude for these concrete and timely initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this juncture, we respectfully appeal to President Clinton and the American Government to continue to exercise U.S. leadership in the search for a lasting solution to the Liberian crisis. Specifically, we call on the United States to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) ASSIST ECOMOG in the enforcement and maintenance of the cease fire;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) ASSIST in the implementation of immediate and total disarmament and demobilization of all armed factions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) ASSIST in reconfirming and enforcing the UN Security Council resolution prohibiting the supply of arms to the warring faction in Liberia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) CREATE favorable conditions for immediate relief assistance of food, water and medical supplies to the general population, and facilitate the return of all relief agencies to the country;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5) PROMOTE and encourage the establishment of a neutral interim governing body that will administer the affairs of state within the framework of the ECOWAS Peace Initiative and without the participation of the war lords. To this end, the war lords must go!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6) ASSIST in organizing the repatriation and rehabilitation of the hundreds of thousands of Liberians who are internally displaced and those now living as refugees in various West African countries, notable Guinea, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7) ASSIST in the development and implementation of the machinery for free and fair democratic elections;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8) ASSIST in the establishment of a United Nations committee to investigate and try persons accused of widespread human rights abuses during the civil war;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9) HELP in mobilizing the international community for the allocation of financial and other resources for the restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction of post-civil war Liberia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10) GRANT permanent legal immigrant status to Liberians residing in the United States, as has been done with many other foreign nationals during times of upheaval in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The history of the founding of the United States of America is associated with the quest for freedom , liberty and justice. It may be helpful to remind American citizens that Liberia was founded by the American Colonization Society--an initiative that was funded by an Act of Congress.  Given the long-standing cordial relationship which has existed between Liberia and the United States, we do not deem it necessary to reiterate the reasons we earnestly believe the USA should help Liberia in her most painful hour. However, we would like only to remind our American allies of Liberia's modest, enduring contribution in supporting and bolstering United States leadership in the world, especially in matters of economic and foreign policy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Liberia is the oldest and most consistent ally of the United States on the African continent;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Liberia fought on the side of the United States and its allies in World Wars I and II;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Since the 1930s, and through World War II, the Korean and Vietnam wars, Liberia has been the chief supplier of natural rubber to American factories.  During World War II, this commodity was critical for US aircraft and other military vehicles;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Liberia joined the USA and her allies in supporting the United Nations resolution establishing the State of Israel in 1948, and cast the deciding vote for that historic realization;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the 'special relationship' that has existed between the two countries, Liberia voted with the United States at the United Nations on most issues critical and strategic to Washington, including Vietnam, despite the West African nation's membership in the Non-Aligned Movement;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *By providing a home, in Careysburg and Brewerville, for the powerful Voice of America (VOA) relay station beamed to the continents of Africa and South America, Liberia was also instrumental in helping the USA achieve its global communication objectives, critical to her victory in the Cold War;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Liberia houses the United States' OMEGA Navigational Tracking Station, one of eight around the world, to guide shipping traffic in the Eastern Atlantic and along the West African coast;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *The lion's share of America's security communication traffic was channeled through Liberia for decades;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Historically, Liberia has been an economic and trade partner of the United States, its very first in Africa. Several major U.S. corporations have maintained long-standing investments in Liberia, among them U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Firestone, B.F. Goodrich, United States Trading Company; Farrell Lines, Pan American World Airways(Pan Am), Sun Oil as well as major investors in timber, fisheries, oil and mineral exploration;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *The United States being the only remaining super power and the world leader of democracy, should play a more active and more direct role in helping to restore peace, law and order and democracy in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> *Over the past six years the international community, led by the United States, has made a positive and decisive difference in peace-keeping operations in many troubled parts of the world, including East and Central Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, Haiti and now Bosnia. The situation in Haiti was an internal conflict. The situation in Bosnia is an internal conflict. So is the situation in Liberia, with which the USA has maintained far longer, closer, more cordial and more mutually beneficial relations?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As earlier indicated, considerable international efforts have been expended to bring peace to Liberia, but these have failed to bear fruit, due largely to the inadequacy of financial and logistical support for the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG, and more especially to the prolonged intransigence of the war lords.. We are convinced that only direct United States intervention can make te decisive difference in helping ECOMOG to bring about an end to the civil war and the peaceful transfer of power to a democratically elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We earnestly hope and pray that President Clinton, the Government and people of the United States will come to the aid of America's oldest African friend and ally, and save her from catastrophe and extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We, Liberians residing in the United States, are prepared to do all in our power, now and in the future, for peace, reconciliation, reconstruction, democracy and good government in our country.</SPAN></P>
