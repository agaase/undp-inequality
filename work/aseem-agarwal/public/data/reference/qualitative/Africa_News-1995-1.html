<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;i&gt;Lagbaja is not only the theme for the music album of Bisade Ologunde's team. It is a theme but more than a theme. It is a concept. A concept of a masked musician. An anonymous man, an unknown instrumentalist striking the keyboard notes or blasting away on the bass guitar. Bisade would not confirm this, but Lagbaja, that is the concept of an unknown man rings a strident bell with both a musical and political resonance. Can we expect not to recall that Fela Anikulapo-Kuti in the 70s released an album titled Unknown Soldier?  Which itself echoed the summed up verdict of a judicial commission that investigated a raid of uniformed soldiers on his erstwhile residential compound in Lagos - the Kalakuta Republic. As Bisade confesses to us, influences fly from mind to mind purely at the stream of the subconscious: Nobody can hold on to it.&lt;/i&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt; Q: Can you give us a brief introduction to your person?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well, I call Bisade a musician. I'm also a producer. We have a band, we've been together now for about five or six years; sorry, this is the fifth year; in another one month, it will be five years we've been together. The band is called Colours. We play basically African music. It's like all my work is based around that band for now. Studio production for now are limited to experimental projects.  That's the summary of what I'm all about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt; Q: Is there any relationship between Bisade Ologunde and the invisible man, the masquerade you called 'Lagbaja'? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Bisade is the producer for Lagbaja. I also conceived the idea. But there has been so much unnecessary focus on the person behind Lagbaja. The more important thing is the message of Lagbaja and the total concept. Anybody could be Lagbaja. It's just the significance of using a mask. And the main importance of that mask is that the mask is like a symbol of the facelessness of the so-called common main in Africa. So, we have different people perform the role of Lagbaja, being masked performers. But Bisade is Bisade. I'm not Lagbaja. If I wish too, I could wear the mask and perform Lagbaja also. But somehow, I think it's probably due to some press misconception that led people to thinking of Lagbaja as Bisade or whatever. We've had several people play the role of Lagbaja as a matter of fact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt; Q: Looking at the music trend in Nigeria, would you say there is anything called Nigerian Jazz?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Em Classification of music is basically for communication. If you wish to call something Nigerian Jazz, that would be your classification. Generally, I understand jazz to be a universal style.  It's equally a universal tag. Music is a language that is universal.  So, when we talk about Jazz, it's got to be the same Jazz all over the world. &quot;Nigerian Jazz&quot; could only mean an English phrase to talk about the Nigerian scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Richard Smith was talking about this classification and how they relate to the Nigerian environment. Like reggae, that we have only one or two reggae musicians in Nigeria playing the kind of reggae that you find in the West Indies and all that - Can we have a general apart from Jazz, may be reggae and calypso Do you think it is possible to have any of these forms? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: This is possible. But we have some problems I will say, of knowledge, know-how. When you talk about Jazz, basically, even in America where Jazz is probably at its peak form, there are all kinds of controversies on what is Jazz and what is not Jazz. So, when you talk about Jazz, basically people, purists think in terms of the original art form that was the popular music of the world at some point in time and that has styles like swing, bebop, blues. They tend to consider that more like Jazz than what generally people call Jazz here which is classified as fusion in their own terms. So when you talk about Nigerian Jazz, it's like you are now beginning to add another dimension to the confusion of classification. Lots of what we might call Nigerian Jazz might end up just being another type of fusion which is basically like taking instruments of standard Jazz forms and having the instruments of African or Nigerian forms and adding those things. If you put percussion in Jazz it's no news. It's been done even since the days of Coltrane - all kinds of amalgamation, mixtures of Jazz and other forms. So, the sub-division can go on endlessly. I prefer to just keep to the international standard of what they believe is Jazz and how they classify the other forms, the ones they call music of avant-garde or the ones they call fusion. Or indeed Jazz of the more recent hip-hop adventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt; Q: So, it's not possible to recognise any local trend that can really be?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: We can talk about the efforts of Nigerians and their ideas of Jazz but they are not many, they are not sufficient to have a movement. When we talk about new ideas and movements, you must have an active scene. You must have musicians coming together in workshops, exchanging ideas; when these guys, the M-Base guys take up the saxophone, they just come together, Greg Osby, Steve Coleman, they come together, they play, they discuss, they rub minds together.  And then ideas come out over a period of time. It's an active, dynamic thing. That's what I'm saying, that it's not a very active movement. One or two people. Really, they are just making individual efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is it possible to make the same comment about reggae? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Now, reggae in a way, yes. But I' II say what really made reggae popular in Nigeria was the media and Bob Marley and all the Virgin Record guys - I-Roy and co. It took a long time before authentic Jamaica -like reggae came out. The youths that were listening then grew up until they were able to play. It was easier for them to tend to reggae because, one, the technical facilities they needed weren't that complicated. Most of reggae is based around the two, three chord progression. Much like you find in highlife, basic primary chords most of the time. A few adventurous pieces have more than three, four chords. But it's easier to learn some basic chords and play reggae. Also, there is a particular rhythm which you play when you play those forms. As opposed to Jazz where a piece could have probably some nine, ten chords with some different arrangements per section. But aside from blues that also uses basic primary chords and extensions of them like seventh, ninth, in reggae there are basically the primary chords, the one, four, five major and a few minors. So I think that is what aided the growth of reggae.  Also the general culture, again through the media, aided the growth of reggae. And I think it is through practice that a style develops.  Eventually, it got to the point where people were able to play in a style that could almost be called a Nigerian style of reggae. Also, Nigerian could be a wide classification. If you play an instrumental piece of reggae, it would sound very much like an instrumental piece of reggae from Jamaica. But then, when you start singing, the accent will give you away and then you see a difference. But they got to the point of aping so much, talking the patois, &quot;I 'n I&quot; and &quot;gimme likkle sugar' and stuff like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Can we go back a bit? Give us brief over view of your musical backgrounds? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Musically, I've been playing in bands from school. First of all, it was Government College, Ibadan. Later, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife. I was lucky to have friends that were active in music too. So, together we kind of taught ourselves through reading books and discussing and arguing, sometimes ignorantly, until over time our interests grew and our skills too on some instruments. There were many influences, Nigerian and foreign. I will say the very first artiste that I got into was Carlos Santana. And rock. But you see, there were some instrumental rock pieces like Samba Patti. And as a matter of fact, it was from that style, that instrumental rock thing, that I got to recognise that there were other pieces called jazz. So, it was from Carlos Santana I got into Bob James and Earl Klugh. And it was my surprise about a year later I found out that there were even more exciting forms - swing, big band, bebop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: You were reading most of the time? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: It was more of listening then. More like you just get to a place by chance and you hear that someone has a record and he's playing it and something sounds interesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: What about the Nigerian Scene? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: The Nigerian scene? It was mainly Fela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: What did you study?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I did first degree in Education Biology. Then I did an M.B.A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: About which time were you focused on Fela?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Fela has been from secondary school. Well, not only Fela.  There was Fela and Baba L'Egba - that's Yussuf Olatunji- and Haruna Ishola. It was much later, during my Masters years that I got into fuji, I was more excited about apala and sakara, especially Baba L'Egba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: What is it about Yussuf?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: There is this smooth oh not blues in the scene of America blues as such, but the feel; blues in the scene of the feel. In fact when he attempted to sing the fast songs in the fashion of that time, they were usually in his funny drawl that if you aren't careful, listening to the music, you'll probably sleep off. But there are very exciting ways in which he would say things. Despite the fact that I am Yoruba, it took me a long time to even understand some Yoruba things he was saying because of the way in which they were said. Not following the usual phonetic patterns of Yoruba, &quot;do-re-mi-re-do&quot;; the basic things; turning things around. And also the poetry of his compositions. The way he would start in the middle, stop in the middle and repeat parts of it, then the guys in the band would probably just join like they had forgotten they were supposed to join and end the piece. But I found out it was actually a style - not that they forgot or anything, it was just the style. Apala came into my consciousness more because somehow it was popular around with some DJs. So you got to hear them on the radio. But again it was the composition of Haruna Ishola. I remember clearly &quot;Ina ran/O k' omo to o't owo b'eeru;&quot; &quot;On my way to London. Ko s'ewu rara.&quot; Quite exciting pieces at that time. I think it was the sheer pleasure of listening to all those During my Masters years, I had a friend who had discovered fuji before me. So, he just brought a couple of records and I got to hear them. Then it was Barrister</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: What hit you about fuji? Was there also a feel?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I really can't place my finger. It was a gradual thing. I would say that as a matter of fact, I initially looked down on fuji.  It didn't strike me as anything exciting. It sounded like they were even stealing pieces from apala and sakara. But gradually, I got to find that they had their original style. It took a long time to even differentiate between Barrister and Kollington. They even looked alike to me at that time, sounded alike and so on. So, it was after a while you find they had totally different styles. Then came Wasiu with his Talazo Disco</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Barrister and Kollington are probably in the old school now with the Wasuis coming out. What are the differences? It seems their works have not been able to go beyond Nigerian shores. Is there something about it that is unable to aspire to world standard?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think it's difficult to find a reason for its not going international. Of course they play abroad and stuff like that. But when it comes down to individual creativity, the personality of the man behind the music, Sunny Ade taking juju beyond these mighty boundaries has to do more with Sunny Ade as a person. Because music nowadays is seen from the perspective of the individual, of the solo act, and how he puts the package together; what he looks like, sounds like and everything. In spite of the language barrier, Sunny was able to do something. I think in fuji, there hasn't been a person with that personality yet; you know, who is dynamic enough to have the so-called star quality. It's not a thing you can hold on to, but he has them. Now, having said that I think, it's also still developing.  I think it had a very big break about seven years ago. Then it actually almost took over all parties from juju. And I think it was basically because of the fact that it was easier to buy equipment to play fuji. So even today, you have thousands of fuji musicians around. At that time, it would cost you about N125.00 to buy the total fuji equipment. But because it was mainly sekere (maracas) and sakara. In fact, not even gangan (talking drum) that was so expensive. A single flat-faced sakara then was about N15.00; two sakaras, about four omele, then sekere, agogo (gong) and you are fine. And, of course, guys went there. As opposed to juju that you needed to buy a bass guitar and about four guitars and a synthesizer and a drum set- and these are foreign things. So it was quite expensive. Fuji players/musicians even went so far as offering to play for free, hoping that they would be sprayed at the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: You had a project. Can you talk about it - with one of the fuji artistes?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I found out then that fuji was a growing style, I was quite excited. It was an active like an active Yoruba popular music. Or let's say metropolitan, urban - In Lagos, they had what you call jumps everyday of the week in different places. Again, it came down to being able to afford the instruments to play with. Also, the instruments are there, being as a Yoruba thing. In addition, they already had people they could look up to, people who were technically versatile already. So they had heroes to worship and, learn from percussion wise. Therefore, it was growing. This is very much unlike the saxophone. I mean. I had to learn the sax myself, more or less. Those I thought I could look up to were themselves not so good, just about average. You couldn't find people to tell you about tones, and to correct you. They would think that's good already when you know you are not even sounding like what you know you should sound like they can't even tell the difference. Those you thought were the heroes, you get close to them and found they were out of tune. They could hardly play in more than one or two keys. But in fuji then, it's like you have these people who are entirely in the music business. It was possible to go ahead and learn from those - ask questions, watch them, so they were playing. I got excited about this, going round and watching them. Then I decided to invest in it and record an artiste. Although apart from creative reasons, I had commercial motives at that time too. You see I found out that it was actually the cheapest thing I could release. Now, pop music, if you really want to sound good, you have to have the right equipment and you have to have the know-how to operate the equipment well. Then, more of the time, you took many more sessions to have something done in the studio. Now, for fuji, the guys play together. This is more like the jazz of those days. You go to the studio, the guys come together and they just play. And they record about two or three tapes. That's the music. Not that you go to the studio, you record the drums, you record the bass guitar and the keyboard, you overdub this and that; it takes a long time. And then it is not their own music. Really, people were still learning the technology involved.  You sometimes had the synthesizer and you couldn't programme it, you use whatever thing is in the synthesizer, stuff like that. But in fuji, it is different, where the music is around you, and they could play together as a band. So, in three sessions, I could finish a programme. So, I decided to look all over town to find the kind of guy that I thought could do the kind of thing I wanted him to do. I had my ideas too like an A and R (artiste and repertoire) person. So I was looking for a young person who believed in himself, and who could compose. Because I found then that you heard the same songs everywhere. Obviously only a few people were really composing. Most of the others, even the established acts were like stealing or borrowing ideas and concepts from the others who hadn't the chance to record. So it's difficult to track down a person with these qualities. Especially one who was able to compose. Also who looks good - had the so-called star quality you can really put your hands on. And of course who was sensible enough to want to work. I almost gave up after about six months. Then, by chance, I saw a guy playing at Ketu (area of Lagos). And his voice was good. He was sounding very good. But he looked very sheepish kind of in his performance - stand on one side, cock his head to one side. He didn't even have the aura that was captivating. But his voice was great. So, I spoke to his manager who then said I should come back the next day to watch somebody else perform at the same place. I saw that one perform. He was vibrant. But he didn't sound good, he didn't sound creative. So, I told the manager I couldn't work with that too and that was the guy called Hajji Top. So, he said there was a third guy who was performing else where-somewhere else in Ojota. That if I could fix a time with him over the weekend, we could go and watch that guy. That's how I got to see Sandoka. He kind of had much of what I wanted - you know, he was young, he was good looking and he had his own way of singing; slightly aggressive, but he was unique. I also thought at that time that he was composing most of the pieces. That was more like '84, '84/'85. I found eventually that he too was actually borrowing from places I hadn't been. So, When I thought he was composing, he wasn't composing. And I found out that the best of the composers then was a guy called Shaura- that was his nickname. I've forgotten his real name now. His base was Idumota area of Lagos. And he was at constant loggerheads with Wasiu, the Talazo king of the time. So, many of these acts were actually stealing or borrowing or adapting. They go to watch themselves. Like when I'm not playing, I go watch you plat at a jump, I hear something, I pick it up. Because the jump is free- I mean no gate fee, just come in. But they expected you to spray and buy food and stuff like that. So, it's like they hang out together. In fact when you see another star, you'll probably spend about ten minutes praising him and making him dance or whatever. The only real culture then that was really out and developed from the roots. And that was also contemporary, you have moved a little away from apala to what was happening that was entirely ours. It was a real culture. And it was real, it was happening. As opposed to the so-called Nigerian jazz or even pop, it was really happening. One, you had so many people doing it so you could have others to learn from. Also it was from the roots of the Yorubas. It was easy to develop; it was growing. And also it was in a language that they could understand. It came to a time that it was like a colloquial - even mixing words of English into it just like is normal everyday life. So it was more like the authentic contemporary urban style of the Yoruba at that point- even up to now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Do you want to link it to ghetto rap or stuff like that?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Yeah. I think as a matter of fact it's like our own answer to that because that's their real music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Were you looking at that as an artiste or? &lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Just an independent thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: When you look at the coming of people like Adewale Ayuba, Abass Akande Obesere and Sandoka who seem to have taken over from the older Kollington, Barrister era, would you say the jump culture has produced them? Again do you see any of these guys having the potential of achieving the kind of thing Bob Marley achieved for reggae and Sunny Ade achieved for juju music in future?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think it's possible. Not immediately but I think it will develop. There is no doubt it will get to that point. But unfortunately, because of our enslavement to foreign culture and the way people look at foreign things as better, they are already beginning to dilute or should we say commercialise from the point of what they think is commercial by adding synthesizers. They are not even played properly.  In a way, one could say that may be even the way it is played is also real. It's not like they play in a particular way like when you have Baba L'Egba then playing his goje. Goje is like violin. But even the instrument itself, he knows about it. He knows about the tuning, he knows about the way it sounds, he knows about how the way it sounds, he knows about how it blends with his voice and style of playing. So, when you just carry a thing and you just start playing, sometimes the guy even sings on a different key from what the guy who is backing him is trying to do. If the guy who was backing him knew about his instrument, he could as well listen and learn from the lead vocalist's style of doing things. And after, decide to accompany him, learn a different style of accompanying. Not come and install a two, three chord pop style behind the guy who is changing keys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is it the norm now?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Yeah, that's what's happening now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is it going to obliterate the originality of the whole thing?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think it would take a few, probably more serious people.  Maybe somebody will come up with a style among them and develop something. But then it comes down to awareness. One, you have to believe in your own thing. Two, you have to respect yourself, know that you are a worthy human being. And that something that is yours coming from you is as authentic as of anywhere else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: How does the man on the street, who just wants to make a million dollars, how does he have that kind of orientation?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Well (laughter). Well, we can only hope. By the way too, we are working on something similar. It's like em..I've been fascinated by that kind of music from time. So, it's like we came up with this style of music that was highly percussive but not just percussive. We use the talking drum as an instrument of rhythm in backing. Not just talking, but singing. Normally, when you get a talking drummer to play, he plays, he talks, not that he sings. Now you try to now understand his own way of thinking when it comes to melody. He doesn't have to play in what you consider to be the standard Western classification of notes into keys and notes. It's like 'play, play'.  Get about seven guys to play, all different styles, and try to find what is the link between them, the way they think. I mean, like if you ask my talking drummer now to do for you the tonic solfa, I mean the guy, he would probably do about four, five out of seven notes. And that's how he understands that. But he has an authentic musical style in him. He is going to be a master of his drum. So, can I now learn from him? How is he thinking? What is he even thinking about?  How can I use that for my own music in the so-called popular genre?  And that's the thinking. So we kind of produce things that had the talking drum combined with drums to play rhythms. That gives us the beats. And the beats are not the standard four-four beats or the popular disco beats or the hip-hop beats. They are more like, well, they are slightly jerky, probably more related to where the guy was coming from - the drummer. His own personality, his own history of understanding, his own understanding of music, his own free thought.  But again, he's also a product of several influences. He's also heard M.C. Hammer and Michael Jackson. So, in a way, he's been influenced too. But his own interpretation of those forms, of his own instrument is different from my own interpretation. Because I am thinking already in almost the Western key forms. He is still thinking in his own mode. And you can hear it, he is not thinking in terms of how I am thinking, so, he is authentic. And he moves people; and you don't really know what is moving them. You can't say I mean like ask them 'what exactly is exciting about ? They just tell you 'Men, I mean it's nice. It sounds good.' So, there is something about what he is doing that's authentic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: It's an evolution of this decadent style of music where someone like you that is sound and is out of the same urban crowd here but is taking a bunch of talking drummers that are ingrained in the background of the tradition and now is directing them. Is this what you are trying to do? You are taking your own culture among your own class of people and holding on to it too and then with different vibrations?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Yes, the only difference is that may be now I am putting in editing language. May be now I'm doing a little of English. That's the only attempt to communicate to the wide population of English speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is that not modernising?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: No. O.K., now, I won't call it modernising. It comes back again to being honest with myself. Now, initially, I looked down again upon foreign culture because I felt it's doing a bad thing for us here. But then I found that I had to find myself. The fact is that as a young African, I've passed through several experiences. I went to a primary school that was put on the form of British education.  Next, I went to secondary school that was even one of the best in the country, a government school that had white teachers initially who established the school. And then I got to a point where you had to learn the proper way, the proper grammar for English. If you said something wrong, I mean grammatically, they say you misfired; I mean they would make fun of you. So, you had to learn some things, some forms. And then it got to the point where you prefer to wear a shirt and a trouser and you wouldn't want to wear your own thing. It took a long time before you got to where you are. So, as a person, I'm also a product of many influences. Some, traditional, some foreign. All of them affect the psyche. Even things that had nothing to do with music. The politics of the nation, the madness, the ignorance of the people at the top. They affect things that affect you ultimately: your growth is limited to their perception, their lack of vision. So, you are an individual that is a product of many influences. So, I found out that I had to discover myself first of all and be. I mean, I said 'You have to be yourself.' I am not really traditional. Even fuji music if you really want to hear the authentic music of the Yorubas, you have to go to the villages and go to the festivals. The same talking drum I use in a different style. Our talking drummer is ayan, Ayangbola. He was born into the family of talking drummers. So, he grew up as he went with them from ceremony to ceremony and so on.  But he came to Lagos to join juju bands and stuff like that. So, he is a product of many influences. Juju bands were aspiring to add foreign things to their music. In fact, they even quarrelled on who first introduced the trap drum set, who first introduced the bass guitar, who first introduced something exciting. And again as a nation, even as a continent, we are under regular slavery economically, culturally. And the audience you are trying to talk to, people generally, they live under the same condition that you live in, even worse; the listeners. I am not excited about creating art for art's sake. As far as I am concerned, it's a communication thing. Also, I have a message. And I think it's a message I have need to carry across. I cannot sing fuji. As a matter of fact, it would be pretentious because it wouldn't really be real. I cannot play apala per se, that's not me. Now I cannot play jazz like Lee Morgan would, or like John Coltrane would. More or less, I am inspired more by the singing of Miles Davis. It's not a matter of selling out. I' ll never buy ignorance. It's a dynamic thing. And it has to do with your culture at that point in time and the people. Miles was a part of jazz O.K., may be they had a commercial interest too, to make money and stuff like that. But if you look at other great jazz artistes like Sonny Rollins, or like Pharoah Sanders, you find them constantly learning, experimenting. It's a continuous process. And they keep learning and they keep imbibing all kinds of ideas into their stuff.  It's not rigid. A style goes for a while. If you play all the time, you really get bored with something. Like Fela would never play live a song he's recorded. I think it has to do with some form of gaining style of his own. I mean, it would be tough for him to go on stage now and start playing Palaver and Lady He would be bored. And then it wouldn't be challenging to him creatively. I would want to create something new all the time, be on the edge of it. As a matter of fact, now we have a problem with Lagbaja because at this point in time I am almost tired of the music already. And it's not a year old in the market. It's more to do with being creative and having a new ideas that makes those old things very outdated more or less. Not outdated per se but outdated somehow to me. People still want them.  It's like OK., let's play it for them, they are asking for it. But there are new things</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Don't you think you need to give it time to evolve before you switch to another thing?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think it's more because I have grown in awareness over the last eighteen months. And my growth had nothing to do with music. Again it came back to the political situation in Nigeria. The June 12 madness, it's like I understood other things about life. And I got to a point where I found that I had to do other things apart from what I was doing. So, what we are doing now is nearer what I think we are going for. It's not a deliberate attempt to go one way or the other. But I'm just trying to follow my natural inclination; the thing I feel good doing, I enjoy doing and that's giving me some creative vibes.  And that's why the new direction is coming up. So, I was saying that it's difficult to just hang on to one style if you don't think about the importance of course of being dynamic. And nothing is static.  Things keep changing all the time. It should be same for art and for music. And there was no way that jazz itself could ever have been developed if people did not strive for something new. The Africans who were taken as slaves then could have been playing white music of playing their home stuff. Nothing new would have come out. Jazz would never have been developed. It's a matter of dynamism. I'm not an American anyway, I'm not a custodian of traditional jazz or whatever.  I want to make music and communicate my art to the best of my ability and to keep learning from other forms. So, I came up with this new thing now. And I don't think that is the end point yet. I think I will have to see people's response to it. I try to ask questions from people that: 'What really moves you about music? Can you tell me what exactly excites you? I read a couple of books, well, not really read.  I kind of glanced through them trying to they talk about the function of music or whatever. In fact, I wrote a thesis, my thesis of my M.B.A. was on marketing music in Nigeria. So, I had to go through some books; there was a book on functions of music. It gave me a little bit of an insight into what moves people about music. But I'm still not satisfied. People really can't hold on to what they think moves them. And it seems to be what, I mean, there must be a norm to determine what is good music or bad music. It's very very subjective from person to person. And so, it's like I keep wondering whether it's not like a spiritual thing. Something you really can't hold on to, that it's a subconscious thing. That's why people have hits once in their lifetimes and never have another hit. They try their best to find what exactly moved people the first time around and they can't find it again. It's a subconscious mixture of so many things. From the timing of release to the lyrics, to the beats, to the mood of the society. I mean, so many things at that point in time. So I find out that it was just good to be me with all my conflicting influences.  Before we talk about other types of music in Nigeria, this new thing, is it going to have 'Every man's name like Lagbaja or what is the name? What are you calling it? Answer: Well, Lagbaja again. The concept was developed with the idea of mass communication in mind. An image that could be powerful - a masked musician. Somebody you don't know who is behind the mask. At this point in time, I am actually considering whether or not to pack up totally the Lagbaja thing. We have a problem of communication with the people artistically. People want to see the face of the artiste, see your expressions when you are sad, when you are smiling, everything coming to the people. The mask kind of makes the image static; all they can see are the eyes.  They can't see his cheeks or his mouth curl up or curl down. So, there is this static thing about it. We've tried to develop all kinds of masks and reduce this. I even saw some photographs in your shop (Glendora Bookshop/Jazz Hole) of some women from is it Tunisia or from Djibouti, they had this purdah kind of mask which I would say are friendly masks. But still those things have a connotation of religion which I wanted to move away from. Also the mask connoted masquerades in Yoruba culture. Now, I am a Christian. And I really believe in what I believe in. And it's like I didn't feel happy with the mix-up; people take you at times to be a masquerade- Nothing to do with the egungun. This is more like contemporary music. And also communicating the essence of an image. Also we were trying to build an image that could be powerful in terms of recollection. It's difficult to see ten saxophonists play and not remember the guy who was masked. But then that took away from the music because what interests people was who was behind the mask. As opposed to the music itself. So, right now, as a matter of fact, we have serious arguments, discussions, the band, about what to do Lagbaja has already built something. So, it's like how can you decide to just break it down and move on to something else? So, we can't make up our minds what to do. The new thing might still be Lagbaja in the very end. But the image of Lagbaja might be different. Now, also Lagbaja had a political connotation which was deliberate. And which is like the most powerful part of the whole image. 'Lagbaja' in Yoruba means 'So-And So.' 'Somebody', the anonymous person; it's like Tom of Tom, Dick and Harry. So, Lagbaja was chosen as a word to stand for the faceless common man. What really happens when something affects, I mean, like in this country (Nigeria), it happens to a so-called big man, then things move fast. Like when they shot one (army) colonel at the check-point, they threw out police check-points immediately. I tell you there are hundreds of Lagosians who've been shot before and even since then at check-points and nothing ever came out of it. So, it's like they are faceless. They are not known. Except you are in a powerful position or like the son of somebody powerful, you are nobody. So you are faceless. How do we now build an icon, a symbol that would represent the facelessness of the so-called common man - me too I hate that word 'common man'. How do you now represent them?  So, we chose to use a mask to represent that. Two, they are supposed to be common. A connotation which ultimately comes down to cheap, of little substance. So, it was like, o.k., let's use the word 'Lagbaja' to represent that and then try and build the image as a voice of the so-called common people. So that was why we came up with, 'Let him be faceless.' There is a third reason why we came up with the masked face. It has to do with wanting to be private. Because initially I was going to perform as Lagbaja myself before I came up with the idea of steering my original band, Colours as a party band and have somebody perform Lagbaja as a different person. So, I wanted to be a private person. I wanted to be successful at my work and yet be devoid of the co-called glamour attached to show business. Like on Sunday, I just walk from my house, I stroll to the Shrine to go and watch Femi (Anikulapo-Kuti) or walk down Allen Avenue in Ikeja area of Lagos), nobody knows me. Last week, I was at Tejuoso Market to buy some things. Last Saturday I was at Wasiu Ayinde's show at Yaba Tech.  Things like that you couldn't do if your face were known all over by everybody. They would harass you, I mean, in a friendly manner. But you don't have the freedom. So, it was a reason why that image came up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: What do you think of other music forms in Nigeria like our own pop and reggae, highlife and also the folk music of people like Dan Maraya Jos, Mamman Shata?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: Again, I believe that, like I said, we are unique as Nigerians with so many influences. Some years ago, I believed that it was impossible to play pop music like the originators of pop music.  'Pop' itself came from 'popular music' anyway. But I mean the popular African-American style. I was also amazed why Nigerians were so excited about soul music. Why they looked down on Nigerians music.  Why it was foreigners that would come here and show us how to appreciate our own music forms. And then, I found that really it is a complex issue like I was telling you the last time, I think there is what I call ' it's a Black thing happening. Basically, if you look at what people love, Nigerians, it is mainly African-American culture, African-American music. People don't know about AD/DC or U2, or know about Bruce Springsteen here or Mick Jagger or Pete Townsend. Who knows them here? Nobody, more or less. But even the rap guy who is a small success in his state is known here. There is something about the rhythm, there is something about the music, there is something about African-American culture. To me, I think it's a Black thing. So we find that it comes down to the essence of the music. And the same thing applies, I think, to reggae. Because it's a Black thing from Jamaica. Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and the younger ones that came after them, Shaba Ranks and so on. It is the Black thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Is it really conscious?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I am even saying it is subconscious. It is not conscious. It is not like they are going out to listen for who is Black. They just love a piece of music and I am saying ninety per cent of it is a Black thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&lt;strong&gt;Q: Do you think it is the rhythm?&lt;/strong&gt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A: I think it's not just the rhythm. It is a total culture. The hipness of being Black. Look at movies, people like Black movies like nothing else. People love Bill Cosby, Oprah Winfrey on television. I am talking of things that I believe. They love them as much as they love white movies. Then you see our young people trying to ape the Blacks they saw in the movies, they don't try to sound like the white they saw there; the way they talk, the way they walk, they can relate to that. The same thing with sports. Like Mike Jordan, Carl Lewis, they are popular among the youths here, they love them. Tyson, when Tyson came out, everybody wore his hairstyle. And, see the DJs are playing for the people what they perceive that people love. So, I found that this Black thing, there is no point throwing it overboard because in a way it is positive. It's not like they are just crazy for anything foreign. I was also happy that they are not as popular as just anything white. I mean, country music is not as popular as Black music in this country. You still find them in the east (eastern part of Nigeria), especially Don Williams and Kenny Rogers and so on, but just a few of them. Most of the time it is the Black thing that is really hot and really happening, even those Black artistes who are not national successes in the US., they are big here. When Lakeside, came to Nigeria then, Lakeside, Shalamar and so on, they weren't as big as many of the white pop and rock musicians. But here, they were mighty heroes. So, there is a Black thing happening. So, I think that, one day you will find a Nigerian who will come up with a concoction, out of Nigeria, not that he would go out and borrow something from abroad o. Something Nigerian. Some Nigerian that would really hit and I mean, hit it. (GR). 7 .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARTS Fellowships</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Africa Bureau's Division of Productive Sector Growth and Environment (PSGE) has announced the third round of African fellowships.  These fellowships are funded under USAID'a Policy, Analysis, Research, and Technical Support (PARTS) project in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African nationals are annually invited to apply for a fellowship to participate in research and analysis in agriculture and natural resources management. The purpose of the fellowship program is to: ensure African participation in research and analysis on African issues being conducted by U.S.-based organizations; provide fellowship holders with opportunities for professional growth; foster and maintain links among U.S. and African scientists and decision makers in order to adddress development issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PARTS project is designed to increase the use and influence of information and analysis for agricultural and natural resources policies and programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Project activities are organized around a research-analysis-dissemination process that includes issues identification and priority setting, implementation of research and analysis, dissemination of findings, and evaluation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five to ten fellowships are offered annually based on available resources. Usually, at least one fellowship is offered in each of the following five analytic areas: Agricultural Marketing/Agribusiness/Private Sector Development; Food Security and Productivity; Technology Development and Transfer; Natural Resources Management; Environment. The research and analysis in these areas is aimed at sustainable development and economic growth as related to agricultural development and natural resources management. Fellowships include travel, food, lodging, and other allowances according to USAID regulations but do not include salary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each fellowship involves working as a collaborator with American researchers. Participants spend approximately one to six months in the United States. Upon returning home, each fellowship holder is expected to maintain contact with staff in order to disseminate new research findings throughout their home country. Participants must be certified as physically able to undertake the fellowship and must demonstrate English proficiency adequate to interact effectively with English speaking researchers and to write a short report on their fellowship experiences. Strong consideration is given to individuals who have extensive linkages with public and private sector decision makers as well as research institutions and universities in their home country. The program is open to Africans from sub-Saharan countries regardless of sex, race, color, religion, marital status, or political affiliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Africn Fellowship application form must be completed along with a one to two page essay and two attachments. The completed form, the essay and the two attachments are all to be sent to the PARTS project in Washington, D.C., by fax addressed to: PARTS African Fellowship, Fax number (703) 235-3805. Deadline on or before January 31, 1995. Applicants will be notified by fax when their application has been received. Those selected and not selected for fellowships are expected to be notified by fax on or before March 30, 1995. A symposium, Essential Health Research -- Lessons From African Successes will convene on saturday, february 18, 199 in Atlanta, Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Essential national health research (ENHR) is a relatively new concept, stemming from the pioneering Commission on Health Research for Development, formed in late 1987, an independent international effort, underwritten by some 20 private and public agencies, aimed at improving the health of people in developing countries, and focused on the enormous, yet generally neglected, power of research to accomplish that goal. A major report, based on a worldwide review of health conditions, was issued three years later, at the conclusion of the Commission's tenure, Health Research: Essential Link to Equity in Developent, stressing social justice in its pronouncements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission's successor, the Task Force on Health Research for Development, also supported by multiple donors, further advanced and operationalized the concept of ENHR, as an integrated strategy to facilitate the attainment of these goals, and involving communities, researchers, and policymakers in the process. Established in 1993, the nongovernmental Council on Health Research for Development (COHRED), sited in Geneva, now constitutes the long-term mechanism that is coordinating and further encouraging the implementation in developing countries of recommendations and deliberations resulting from the prior two initiatives. In theory and practice, the ENHR approach is quite in contrast to the classical donor-driven modality, organized vertically, for it entails a national consultative process, deals directly with priority setting, and identifies actors/organizations to implement decisions that were reached consensually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENHR strategies are now well underway in a number of countries, with some particularly positive developments reported from sub-Saharan Africa, the region where the twin goals of health for all and socioeconomic development have generally proved elusive heretofore. This two-session, day-long Symposium, organized as part of the AAAS Sub-Saharan Africa Program's Science in Africa series of meetings and publications, will illustrate the unique elements of the ENHR approach, as it is being adapted to circumstances in several African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The morning will open with a brief overview of ENHR and the work of COHRED, to provide background and context. Country-specific examples of ENHR-in-action, each summarized by a principal African participant in the process, will follow. The first topic covered is the setting of ENHR priorities, utilizing two national cases to document the process whereby broad consensus is attained on principal goals and on appropriate resource allocation. The second section concerns the implementation of ENHR, including effective institutional structures, capacity-building efforts, and networking mechanisms. Here the experiences of three countries will be featured. In the third part the crucial question is asked, &quot;What Difference Does ENHR Make?&quot; Ministerial-level representatives from two countries have been invited, as decisionmakers, to assess the impact of ENHR. The final wrap-up, organized as a panel discussion, will evaluate these ENHR efforts broadly, in terms of sustainability and transferability. The discussion will also probe future directions for ENHR, not only further developments in Africa but global prospects, including implications for North America. Joining the African presenters in this panel discussion will be two internationally well-known experts on health research and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizers include Dr. Amy Auerbacher Gimbel, Director, Sub-Saharan Africa Program, American Association for the Advancement of Science, Washington, DC, and Dr. Yvo Nuyens, Coordinator, Council on Health Research for Development, Geneva.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Panos Institute, an international information organization committed to raising public understanding and development worldwide, is pleased to offer resources for teaching about crucial transitional issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working with partners in developing countries, the Panos Institute has produced a series of educational modules designed to stimulate critical thinking and problem-solving and to amplify voices from the global South on a variety of development concerns that are too often overlooked in international affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entitled &quot;From Information to Education&quot;, the project seeks to engage Northern audiences in exploring the process and consequences of development by highlighting the research and analysis of journalists and NGO leaders from developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of particular interest is the module &quot;Conflict and Development.&quot; The module examines the causes and effects of armed conflict, highlights ways in which war impedes development, and describes current approaches to conflict resolution and prevention. Included are case studies of the conflicts in Rwanda and Chiapas, Mexico, and indicators of the social, economic, and environmental consequences with which all countries affected by conflict must grapple. The module concludes with discussion questions and exercises which engage participants in identifying priorities for action in several hypothetical regions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRANSITIONS ABROAD, Traveling Responsibly: A Directory of Opportunities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1977, TRANSITIONS ABROAD, the first magazine devoted to specialty travel, has detailed the rewards of travel with a purpose. Each issue is a directory of information on all the ways to combine international travel with activities of special interest to the individual traveler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The November/December issue focuses on ecotourism or environmentally responsible travel. Responsible tours try to choose locally owned lodging, local restaurants, and employ local counterparts to keep as much of the tourist dollar as possible in the host country. Responsible tours are in-depth learning experiences with the local hosts as teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized by region and country, the possibilities in the current directory include: village-based bicycle tours to all parts of Africa; East African safaris focusing on marine ecology, art, beadwork, language/literature, archaeology, and wildlife conservation; living with village families in Kenya; orangutan research in Indonesia; trekking and elephant safaris in the Himalayas; economic development in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia; snorkeling on the barrier reef of Belize; sailing seminars in the Caribbean; hiking in Patagonia; Spanish immersion and rain forest treks in Costa Rica; yachting in the Galapagos islands; watercolor and drawing in Greece; endangered species tour in Russia; photography workshop in Siberia; traveling seminars in all tropics throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with the directory of special interest tours, this issue contains its usual mix of columns and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">departments emphasizing low-cost independent alternatives to packaged tours: hiking across the Alps, overlanding through Africa, and folk dancing around the world...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A one-year, six-issue subscription to the magazine costs $19.95 from: TRANSITIONS ABROAD, Dept. TRA,P.O. Box 3000, Denville,NJ 07834. New subscribers receive a free 56-page &quot;Guide to Opportunities Overseas&quot;, a selection of the most useful features from the magazine's first 17 years of publication. A free catalogue of dozens of separately printed resource guides on work, travel, and study abroad is available from TRANSITIONS ABROAD, P.O.  Box 1300, Amherst, MA 01004-1300</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Carter Center's African Governance Program has recently published a set of working papers from a Seminar on Democratization in Africa held at the Center, May 13-14, 1994. Faced with the urgent need to review the many political transitions that had occurred in Africa since 1990, more than 30 scholars and practitioners took part in the seminar and 23 papers have been revised for publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The volume, entitled &quot;The Democratic Challenge in Africa&quot;, provides valuable insights into some of the pressing concerns of the democratic movement in contemporary Africa. This is the Center's fourth publication to address issues affecting governance and democratization in Africa. &quot;Beyond Autocracy in Africa&quot;, &quot;Perestroika Without Glastnost in Africa&quot; and &quot;African Governance in the 1990s&quot; were published in 1989 and 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of &quot;The Democratic Challenge in Africa&quot; can be obtained for $15 (individuals) and $24 (institutions). Make checks payable to: The Carter Center. Sender orders to the Office of Public Information, One Copenhill, Atlanta, GA 30307.</SPAN></P>

The conference will be hosted by the Center for African Studies, in association with the College of Humanities, The Ohio State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme chosen for the conference, &quot;The Postcolonial Condition&quot; reflects our sense of the need not only for a critical interrogation of the term &quot;postcolonial&quot; which, in its application to non-Western, has gained wide currency, but also for placing the term itself in relation to the issues raised by the concept of post modernism and to the debates concerning its relevance, either in existential or theoretical terms, to African literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arrangements are being made for a prominent literary figure to feature as keynote speaker at the conference, and for the presence of writers and literary scholars from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Proposals for panels and roundtables are now invited, and should be addressed to: Ms. Najat Elhag, Centre for African Studies, The Ohio State University, 314 Oxley Hall, Columbus, OH 43210; Tel. 614-292-4273.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 226 exhibitors took part in the 1994 Zimbabwe International Book Fair held in Harare, Zimbabwe last August, representing publishers in 39 countries and 25 international organizations and UN agencies. Aside from local Zimbabwean companies, the South Africans comprised by far the largest national group. Eighteen other East, West and southern African countries were represented in Harare, confirming the ZIBF's position as sub- Saharan Africa's most important book trade event and the main pan-African gathering of indigenous publishers. The British Publishers' Association sent a 27 person trade delegation from leading educational and academic publishers.  Special group and national exhibits were mounted from Germany, Italy, Spain, India and Australia. The first two, trade-only days of the Fair attracted 1,100 booksellers, librarians and other specialist visitors, with 30,000 members of the public on the remaining three open days. Overall $2 million-worth of business is estimated to have been transacted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The First African Rights Indaba, held immediately before ZIBF94, raised important policy issues of rights trading and protection for African publishers. Other special events included a Young Scientist Exhibition and a regional Writers' Workshop on Communicating science and Technology, the Houses of Stone international music festival and, at the other end of the multimedia spectrum, a display of state-of-the-art electronic publishing and technology. The organisers of the 1994 Commonwealth Writers Prize also chose Harare and ZIBF94 as the setting for the announcement of its African regional winners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eighth annual Hunger Research Briefing and Exchange, sponsored by InterAction, the American Council for Voluntary International Action and Brown University will be held April 5-7, 1995 at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1995 Briefing focuses on the interplay of resource and policy factors that link vulnerability to hunger and capacities for sustained development in people's lives. Hunger usually is linked to resource scarcity, but are key intervening variables population growth or policy failure? In view of changing relationships of people to land, and peoples to states, how can government, intergovernment, and non-government (including community, field- based, and academic) programs collaborate to make overcoming hunger part of the broader sustainable development goals of economic growth, positive political change, environmental protection, public health, and education?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Key topics to be addressed in the Briefing include the conflicting evidence regarding the impact of economic liberalization and GATT on food security; hunger in development education, and changing hunger scenarios in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in the past, the Briefing will offer an extensive exhibit of books and other publications and will be held in conjunction with the annual awards ceremony for the Alan Shawn Feinstein World Hunger Awards. More than 175 individuals from government and academic institutions and private voluntary organizations around the world typically attend the Briefing.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historic Summit is being convened and chaired by Reverend Sullivan and will focus on finding practical ways to assist in the improvement of the quality of life in Sub-Saharan African countries in areas such as economic development, debt relief, industrialization, educaton, agriculture, medicine and others.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">November 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Calvert Group</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1982 the Calvert Group launched the Calvert Social Investment Fund, the &quot;first mutual fund in the U.S. to oppose apartheid by deliberately refusing to invest in companies doing business in South Africa.&quot; Shortly after Nelson Mandela made his historic call for new international investment in South Africa, Calvert reversed its longstanding policy. One year after Mr. Mandela's call, they released this report, commenting: &quot;We feel strongly that the eyes of the world should remain focused on South Africa.&quot; Calvert has also invested in several community development projects in South Africa. Presented here are excerpts from Calvert's report. For more information or a complete copy of the report, contact: Calvert Group, 4550 Montgomery Ave., Bethesda, MD 20814; (301) 951-4800 &quot;The new South Africa is open for business.&quot;-Wall Street Journal, May 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How has the world responded to the calls made one year ago by Nelson Mandela for new investment in South Africa? While new investments have started to flow into post-apartheid South Africa, considerably more outside capital and non-equity infusions (licensing deals, technology transfers, etc.) will have to reach the nation if it is to achieve President Mandela's broad agenda for change and redress.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Investment Edges Up.&quot; The ranks of U.S. companies with employees or investments in South Africa has increased almost 20 percent (26 firms) since September 1993, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRCC). Up from 119 U.S.-controlled companies present in 1991 to 165 companies at the end of August 1994, it is clear that U.S. investors are beginning to respond to Mandela's call. (Growth in new investment by non-U.S.  companies is also being registered, though at somewhat more modest levels.) The expansion in U.S. companies doing business in South Africa are taken into consideration, the interest in the nation is even more evident, with the number of these non-equity ties surging from 184 to 475, according to IRRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Interest builds in South African stocks.&quot; The demise of apartheid has provided a major boost to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). The JSE has performed strongly over most of the past eighteen months, providing attractive returns to international investors.

Of more direct significance to change in South Africa is the flowering of &quot;homegrown&quot; socially responsible investments. Calvert Group, a U.S. leader in the social investment category, is now making a committment to emerging South Africa-based enterprises, such as the trade-union run Community Growth Fund (CGF), South Africa's only socially screened unit investment trust (the South African version of an open-end mutual fund), and the South Africa Private Investment Fund, which is working to create jobs through the promotion of black middle class entrepreneurship. CGF was launched in 1992 by a collection of South African trade unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to these initial efforts to nurture the fledgling socially responsible investment in South Africa, Calvert encourages multinational corporations doing business in South Africa to adopt socially responsible business practices. In particular, companies present in South Africa to adopt socially responsible business practices.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Jacques Magliolo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black business cannot bid for the Anglo-controlled JCI if proposed changes to present Johannesburg Stock Exchange regulations relating to pyramids go ahead this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New Africa Investment Limited's chairman, Dr Nthato Motlana, one of South Africa's most prominent black businessmen, says: &quot;We will oppose the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's forthcoming changes to regulations, particularly those affecting pyramid structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now that we are becoming more established in big business, the JSE and white conglomerates want to change the rules,&quot; he says, asserting that &quot;we want, we desire and it is necessary for conglomerates stay in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; It would be unfair for blacks to follow different rules, when the old ones have proven to be successful for the Oppenheimers, the Ackermans and the Wieses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says another black businessman: &quot;We want to be part of conglomerates and, if rules regulating these companies have been good enough for whites, surely its good enough for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motlana believes that &quot;to change the playing fields now would be race discrimination&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One stockbroker, head of research, says: &quot;All new black businesses are pyramids, but it is only in being a part of such a conglomerate that they can get access to massive funds to take on the Anglos or bid for the restructured JCI.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motlana agrees: &quot;Pyramids enable companies with small shareholder stakes to control larger companies. If this type of structure is abolished it will make it impossible for blacks to own companies or to help transfer wealth to the disadvantaged people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this manner, Motlana confirms that his group will be making a bid for &quot;a stake in JCI's industrial division&quot;. Although a number of &quot;informal meetings have taken place with Anglo and JCI, no firm plan will be formulated before April&quot;, says Motlana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JSE proposals will prohibit second tiered pyramids by the end of this year, which means a holding company which is listed can have only one listed subsidiary. In turn, that holding company cannot have a major shareholder that is listed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nail fits the description of a multi-tiered structure. While it controls listed institution Metlife, its shareholder is recently listed Corporate Africa. In addition, another of its shareholders, Sanlam, may seek a listing in the future, which would force them to sell their shares in Nail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say that it is doubtful whether Nail would be able to acquire Sanlam's shareholding. Although Nail's pre- listing statement indicates that it bought 30 percent of Metlife from Sanlam, Nail actually controls only 10 percent. The company wishes to acquire an additional 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like a number of black businesses, Nail finds itself in a predicament.  While it intends to continue to grow by taking advantage of a breakup of white pyramid structures, it wants to be in control of its own conglomerates which would contravene new pyramid requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a complete contradiction,&quot; says the head of research. &quot;You cannot have it both ways; either you are for a breakup of all pyramid structures, or against it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a corporate financier: &quot;Most businessmen don't understand or even know that changes are in the pipeline. If they did, they wouldn't be listing companies in pyramid form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To highlight his point, he mentions the quick succession of listings of Nail and its major shareholder Corporate Africa. &quot;Despite having a host of corporate experts, stockbrokers and merchant banks involved in these listings, the directors of Nail did not seem to know that the JSE changes would take place in 1995,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Motlana is determined that his group and other black organisations will continue to grow in pyramid form. He believes that this will enable them to turn Metlife's two million policyholders into shareholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our plan is to take annual actuarial surplus (profit made on policy funds which are paid out to policyholders only on maturity) and to buy shares in the company,&quot; says Motlana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would do this only at the policyholders' request.&quot; While plans are in progress to obtain a share in JCI, Motlana intimates that the group is in the process of conducting negotiations for other takeovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you don't grow, you die,&quot; says Motlana.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Wale Akin Aina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How was $571.78 million (N12.58 billion) additional revenue from crude oil sales during the nine month Gulf war/ crisis spent? Last week sources told Newswatch that unraveling the details of how the money was spent is &quot;like peeling an onion. Tears well up in your eyes but you don't want to stop.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The windfall was as a result of a surge in prices of crude oil (an average of $23 per barrel during the crisis) following the scarcity of supplies in the international market (a shortfall of four million barrels per day). The money was also part of the $12.4 billion (N272.8 billion) which the country earned in oil sales between September 1988 and June 1994 and which was placed in special accounts. Most of it was earned during the administration of Ibrahim Babangida, former president and a retired general.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1991, William Keeling, the Lagos correspondent for the London Financial Times, was deported for reporting that Nigeria had spent more than half of an estimated $3 billion it earned during the crisis. Government said then that the report was false. Alex Akinyele, former information minister in the Babangida administration, said the money was used to create a foreign currency stabilisation account. He added that as at the end of June 1991, $1.7 billion remained as balance in the account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last October, Pius Okigbo, an economist, who headed a panel to reorganise the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, revealed that $12.2 billion of the $12.4 billion has been spent. He said that only $206 million was left but added that most of the money was &quot;spent on what could neither be adjudged genuine high priority projects or truly regenerative investment.&quot; In simple English, the money was squandered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weeks of investigations in Abuja and Lagos by Newswatch confirmed the observations of the Okigbo panel and revealed questionable and often unexplained expenses by the Babangida administration, Records available to the magazine indicated that the Nigerian High Commission in London was allocated $18.2 million or 3.2 percent of the $571.78 million of the oil windfall. Other embassies also benefited from the former president's largesse, although there were no papers to show how they spent the money.  Among the beneficiaries are the Nigerian Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which collected $14.99 million; Nigerian embassies in Teheran, Iran; Niamey, Niger; And Islamabad, Pakistan, which got $2.76 million, $3.80 million and $3.80 million, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Nigerian Embassy in Israel got $13.07 million. Newswatch also found out that $1 million and $0.50 million were given to Liberia and Ghana respectively as gifts. The former president's travels abroad gulped $8.95 million from the windfall money, while those of his wife, Maryam Babangida, cost $0.99 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is not all. Newswatch sources have confirmed that welfare expenses at Dodan Barracks, Lagos, and Aso Rock, Abuja, cost $23.98 million, while $18.30 million was expended on television and video equipment for the presidency. A documentary film on Nigeria titled: Nigeria: Journey to Nationhood, detailing the country's history from the colonial times to the administration of Babangida was produced in 1991 for $2.92 million. Sources also disclosed that television and video equipment for the Ahmadu Bello University, ABU, cost $17.90 million, while medical equipment for Aso Rock Clinic cost $27.25 million. The Army, the sources added received $3.85 million for ceremonial uniforms, while another $323.35 million was given the ministry of defence. Money from the windfalls that was spent on security was $59.72 million, while defence attaches in the embassies of Nigeria abroad got $25.49 million. Newswatch also learnt that $1.04 million was spent on the General Staff Headquarters, GHQ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How the money was used by the different government agencies were at best not specific and at worst, obscure. A presidency source said that the defence ministry which got 56.55 percent of the money did not state any specific project it used it for, although it was speculated that part of the money was used for the car gift to military officers. Also, it was not clear why the embassies normally funded by the ministry of foreign affairs, needed a total of $56.64 million or why defence attaches got $25.49 million. All the money - $12.4 billion - was kept in dedication, stabilisation or other special accounts which were hardly applied for the purpose for which they were originally designed. The dedication and other special accounts in particular, were applied beyond their original scope, clearly undermining their fiscal objectives. For example, the dedication account was extended to a lot of non-priority projects and the stabilisation account was used to cover up expenditure of excess revenues which surpassed projected earnings.  Newswatch was told that funds in special accounts were spent as fast they were accumulated. Okigbo while presenting his report to General Sani Abacha, last year, said &quot;these disbursements were clandestinely undertaken while the country was openly reeling with crushing external debt overhang - these represent, no matter the initial justification for creating the accounts, a gross abuse of public trust.&quot; (Newswatch October 24,1994.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dedication account was created in 1986 by former President Babangida with 20,000 barrels per day to fund the Liquefied Natural Gas, LNG, project. Earnings from the allocation were paid into a special account with the Midland Bank of London. In 1988 other special accounts were created to fund specific developmental projects. According to CBN sources the receipts for the dedication account between 1988 and June 30 1994, totaled $6.195 billion but $6.109 billion was disbursed leaving a balance of about $85.9 million. Sales of mining rights by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, which was also placed in a special account recorded $1.745 billion was spent leaving a balance of $1.66 million. The Signature Bonus account had $101.06 million. Only $1.06 million was kept after $99 million was disbursed. Similarly, only $117.3 million was left in the Stabilisation account which had $4.398 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the whole, receipts from the various accounts were $12.441 billion out of which $12.235 billion was disbursed. That left a balance of only $206.03 million. Sources at the CBN also gave a breakdown of the expenditure from the dedication account on projects between 1988 and 1994. These are the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja which got $1.518 billion and the Ajaokuta Steel Plant which received $1.473. The Aluminium Smelter Plant in Ikot Abasi, Akwa Ibom State, also received $765.45 million; Itakpe Iron Ore project got $804.81 million; Shiroro Electricity project received $91 million while other projects received $651 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the dedication accounts alone, the projects received a total of $5.304 billion between 1988 and 1994. The presidency got $262 million, Defence received $401.2 million, while $130.7 million was disbursed on security. Other projects which CBN sources were not specific about $10.5 million. Many of the projects, however, especially Ajaokuta and the Aluminium Smelter, plant are either of doubtful viability or misplaced priority. World Bank reports on the two projects have described them as expensive and unviable. The dedication and special accounts were indeed, according to the sources, parallel budgets for the presidency and the decision of what projects to be financed was by Babangida alone, depending on pressures brought to bear on him by sponsors of specific items.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How were the accounts operated? According to sources in Lagos and Abuja, request for money from the accounts were, in the instance of security and defense matters, made by the then director-general of the National Intelligence Agency, NIA, Halilu Akilu, a retired brigadier-general or by the former governor of the CBN, Abdulkadir Ahmed. In some cases, the governor may approve money from the accounts and simultaneously send a request to the former President Babangida for approval. At other times Akilu would go directly to the director of foreign operations without his request which is later referred to Ahmed for approval. At no time, according to CBN sources, was there any document in which Babangida directed the way the accounts should be operated. In fact, the sources added, at no time were the accounts operated when Ahmed was away. He was the only one who, as governor, had the authority to effect payment on the authority of the president. Payment was made when Ahmed sent a minute to the bank's director of foreign operations through the deputy governor, international relations. But both officials, according to the resources, only acted on the authority of the governor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidency sources told Newswatch that if money from the dedicated account was needed for any undertaking, a note was sent by Ahmed to the CBN's director of foreign operations stating that he should release so many million dollars for such project. It would then be stated that the note should stand as a directive and a receipt for such money. In all cases, the accounts were debited accordingly. CBN sources said that the bank did not request, demand or was it given any documentary evidence of the services or projects paid for because these were deemed classified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of payment of contractors, only certificate of performances were lodged with the bank and at no time were the original contract documents made available to the CBN. Ahmed, the sources say, would from time to time review the performance certificates and as governor of the bank direct that money from any one of the special accounts be used to pay the contractors. It was, therefore, not possible, the bank sources complained to check requests for payment against the total value of the contract so as to guard against double payment or inaccurate claims. The bank only effected payment once it confirmed that signatures were genuine. It had no authority to verify the authenticity of any claim. Newswatch learnt that in a number of cases there were variations between amounts approved for payments and the actual amount disbursed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the way the accounts were operated and the manner in which money was withdrawn from them made it unclear which particular account should be debited for a particular project - whether Dedication, Sale of Mining Rights, Signature Bonus or Stabilisation accounts. Said a source, &quot;it was like the governor (Ahmed) had a buffet. You could pick from any dish you liked.&quot; The sources said further that at no time did the former governor recommend and try to utilise the monies in the special accounts to build up the country's external reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was to be one of the sorry effects of the manner in which the special accounts were operated. Okigbo last October said: &quot;Had these resources of $12.4 billion, or even a significant portion been paid into the external reserves, the impact on the naira/ dollar exchange rate today; on the attitude of our external creditors; on the credibility of Nigeria and on the environment for foreign investment, etc. would have been incalculable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A CBN source explained last week that if the money had been used to build up the external reserves, the impact on the exchange rate would had been so strong that by last year, N1 would have exchanged for $1.004 or even less. More importantly, at $4 billion in debt servicing payment per annum, the country would have been able to clear its interest for three years and would have received generous reschedualing arrangements from the London and Paris Clubs. Both held 7.16 percent and 63.24 percent respectively of the country debts by 1993. But in the period between 1988 and 1993, Nigeria's external debt continued to grow. In 1988 it was $30.69 billion. It rose to $33.99 billion in 1990, but dropped slightly to $28.718 billion in 1993. In 1988, the external debt was $17.34 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank had long criticised the operation of the special accounts by the Nigerian government. Last October, at its annual general meeting in Washington, the bank said that Nigeria should close down the accounts as they were drain pipes and conduits for corruption. The bank observed that with the operation of dedication and other special accounts, actual revenue figures earned by Nigeria is difficult to ascertain and therefore it was difficult for it to assist in reschedualing the nation's external debts or granting it concessionary arrangements with major creditors. The World Bank observed that through Nigeria for instance, said it earned N63.55 billion in 1992, its actual revenue from oil was more than that. It also said government should stop extra- budgetary spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CBN officials think the World Bank is right. According to them the receipts of earnings into the dedication and other special accounts were never reflected in the budget. Also, the receipts and balances in these accounts, they said, were not included in the federation account. The implication is that by not placing receipts in the federation account, the federal government had forcibly acquired what would have legitimately gone to the state and local governments, thereby disrespecting the revenue allocation formula.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all these, the NNPC cannot be completely absolved. It is the NNPC which directs crude oil buyers on which of the accounts to make payments, although the monies in the special accounts do not form part of the corporation's oil sales. Last October, Emmanuel Abisoye, a retired major-general, who headed a panel that looked into the activities of the corporation, discovered that N71.39 billion the country earned in oil revenue and lodged in several accounts of the NNPC between 1991 and 1993 had been misappropriated. The money was said to have been paid out by the corporation on the orders of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last December 15, the National Economic Intelligence Committee, NEIC, lamented the fact that the NNPC and CBN budgets, which together amount to 70 percent of the federal government budget are a threat to fiscal stability and monetary management. The NEIC observed: &quot;Added to this is the fact that dedicated accounts which are projected at about 40 percent of federal government budget are controlled by the two vital and seemingly independent agents of government.&quot; Abisoye found the manner in which NNPC managed its accounts distressing. He observed in his report to government: &quot;NNPC does not respect its own budget. NNPC does not respect its own plans. NNPC does not respect constituted authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appears reflected in the events following the change of pump head prices of petrol from 70 kobo to N3.25 in November 1993. In canvassing for the hike, the NNPC promised to pay the government N20 billion, pointing out that out of the amount, government would be able to ameliorate the consequences of the increase on workers and the cost of living. But as at last December 15, the NNPC had only paid government N1.8 billion leaving a debt balance of N18.2 billion. Even then the payment of N1.8 billion was made after great pressures from the federal ministry of finance and NEIC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the presidency told Newswatch that it was because NNPC didn't pay that government decided all payments for the purchase of fuel from NNPC depots should be made to government's account in the CBN. From this, an agreed ratio of sharing would be reached between government and NNPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, however, NNPC officials offered an explanation on why they were unable to pay the arrears. According to them, government has not paid the corporation a kobo since the prices were raised to N11 per litre. They told Newswatch that NNPC was to get N1.75 out of the N11. That explanation did not clear the confusion or answer the question why the corporation is still unable to keep its own side of the original bargain. According to sources, the problem facing the NNPC is one of executive interference.  Although government withdraws money from the corporation by fiat, it sometimes struggles to pay its joint -venture partners. This is why the NNPC struggles for increment in domestic petroleum products, the last was the 339 percent increase in fuel prices last October. This is exactly why the Abisoye panel recommended that the NNPC be freed from the ministry of petroleum resources and be allowed to operate as a purely commercial organisation. The Abisoye panel was also said to have advised government to withdraw from the oil industry and allow NNPC a free hand. This was the same recommendation that had been made much earlier by the defunct Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation, TCPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch learnt that the Okigbo panel recommended that all further disbursements from the CBN special accounts, including the dedication account, be discontinued while the remaining funds in them be transferred to the external reserves. The Okigbo panel also directed that receipts from sales of dedicated crude oil be paid into the external reserves. From the beginning of this year, it said, there should be no more dedication of crude oil. And that if there is to be a dedication account, a full disclosure of both expected revenue and projects of expenditure should be announced in the budget. The Okigbo panel, according to sources, also said that the GHQ special account should be transferred to the Federal budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the Abacha administration in responding to international pressure, pledged to discontinue the dedication of crude oil. It said specific projects would be funded through direct budgetary allocation. In fact, it allocated $279 million as special treasury allocation to finance certain projects. Only the dedication of oil from the funding of the LNG project was to continue. Curiously, however, the government increased the amount of dedicated oil from 105,000 barrels per day to 150,000 per day by last June, It is not clear whether government will continue with this pattern when it announces its 1995 budget.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Utibe Ukim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria made significant progress on the road to economic recovery in the six years of the Structural Adjustment Programme, SAP. However, distortions in implementing the reform package, and the final repudiation of the programme by the Abacha government have combined to push the country further down the road to that recovery, says a report by the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the report which catalogued the performance in Nigeria and other sub-Saharan countries, the World Bank said SAP made it possible for Nigeria to reverse its economic decline and achieve reasonable growth. But it said these would have been more impressive and sustainable if the progress of the reforms were consistent and uniform. It gave the major gains of SAP as the reversal of the negative growth rate of gross domestic product, GDP, which averaged - two percent in 1980-86. Between 1986-92, the bank said Nigeria's GDP growth averaged 5.8 percent with the real sector - agriculture and manufacturing - recording significant growth in output. &quot;Nigeria's adjustment programme, however incomplete, has produced clear positive results,&quot; the report said. It noted further: &quot;The decline in GDP growth has been reversed: from - two percent annually during the 1980-86 to more than five percent during 1986-91. The ratio of investment to GDP, although, still lower than 1981-83, has improved since the crisis years. Non-oil export grew in the early years of the adjustment programme. Agricultural production responded more than manufacturing.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growth in agricultural output averaged four percent for the first five years of SAP. Before then, output remained stagnate, the report said. The bank said both food and export crop production, rose sharply following the introduction of SAP. For instance, between 1986 and 1990, production of export crops went up by nearly 45 percent while food crops productions grew by 60 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the manufacturing sector, output increased by 5.1 percent in 1987 and 12.9 percent in 1988 against a decline of 3.9 percent in 1986. Although , these growth rates declined subsequently, the report noted that subsectors such as textiles, rubber, minerals, wood furniture and certain food products which depended on domestic sources for a large percentage of input continued to record impressive growths, both in output and capacity utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 'Adjustments in Africa: Lessons from Country Case Studies', the bank attributed the overall growth in the GDP to three factors. &quot;First, oil production and exports are not effected by public sector inefficiency and other policy distortions,&quot; said the report. The other reasons are that the private sector, especially the agricultural sector, performed well partly because of some improvements in the incentive structure brought about by the reforms and the efficiency in the deployment of capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite these growths, the report said that overall, the economic reform package produced largely unsatisfactory results. Matched against the objectives, it noted that the reforms left much to be desired as it failed to meet the laudable goals of the programme. However, it conceded that even the haphazard implementation was better than the total abandonment of the programme. This view is supported by Christopher Ezeh, managing director of John Holt Plc. He told Newswatch that &quot;even the half-hearted prosecution of the structural adjustment programme was a lot better than what we are doing now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ezeh said that SAP effectively abolished economic regulation. &quot;It became easier for people to trade, the naira was a bit stable for sometime.  It was easier to get foreign exchange if you wanted it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that did not last for long. The political will, needed to effectively execute the programme was lacking. &quot;The growth in money supply was too high. Budget deficit was still there too,&quot; Ezeh said. These combined to render the reform programme ineffective after the second year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the Babangida administration introduced SAP in 19486 as the cornerstone of its economic reforms programme, the objectives were to reform the exchange rate mechanism, liberalise trade, abolish commodity boards, and put in place a market-oriented economy where government would concentrate efforts in creating a conducive environment for private enterprise to flourish. The main elements of SAP were the adoption of tight fiscal and monetary policies to reduce inflation and cut down on government expenditures and bring deficits to four percent of GDP. Others were the dismantling of exchange control to pave way for the emergence of a market- determined exchange rate policy, the liberalisation of trade through review, of customs tariffs and excise duties and the abolition of price controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme also included the reform of the financial sector which was hitherto heavily regulated, as well as the privitisation and commercialisation of public enterprises and abolition of commodity boards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These objectives were designed to tackle the problems which the government inherited on assumption of office. The Buhari/Idiagbon regime had rejected a loan facility from the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and instead opted for policies such as import licensing, counter-trade and the allocation of 34 percent of export earnings for debt servicing. These policies were rejected by both the IMF and the World Bank and credit lines to Nigeria from international lending institutions were withdrawn. By 1984, inflation stood at 40 percent. Imports declined by 22.7 percent in 1984 against the 1983 level. Non-oil exports also declined by 44.2 percent, disrupting government's plan to develop reliable alternative revenue source to oil. With the drop in earnings from oil sales, the Babangida government needed to win the confidence of international creditors to secure debt reschedualing reliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the regime opened discussions with the IMF, it initiated a national debate on whether Nigeria should accept or reject the IMF loan and its conditions. Nigeria opted to reject the loan. In its place, the government drew up the reform package of SAP largely with inputs from the IMF. SAP was introduced in July 1986 and planned to last two years. The take-off of the programme coincided with the introduction of similar programme in many sub-Saharan African countries, desperately in need of economic recovery and injection of new capital. The countries included Burundi, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Senegal and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report noted that in Nigeria and nearly all the countries that adopted reforms - Cote d'Ivoire is an exception- GDP grew. But these gains were directly linked with the effectiveness of implementation. The report noted that while the objectives for reforms in Nigeria was &quot;comprehensive&quot;, the implementation left rooms for distortions. &quot;Although, implementation started well, it soon slackened, and even regressed.&quot; It blamed this on &quot;political factors, interacting with fluctuating oil revenue.&quot; It noted that it was only during the first fifteen months of the programme, July 1986 - December 1987, that the implementation was effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the initial period, crucial reforms were implemented fairly effectively. In one stroke, the naira was devalued, the import licensing system was eliminated, and the commodity boards were abolished,&quot; it said.  Thereafter, distortions were introduced into the programme as the government began to yield to political interests. This greatly marred the effectiveness of the entire programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The derailment of SAP began with the 1988, N27.102 billion reflationary budget of the government. Said the report: &quot;In January 1988, the programme stalled and in some areas, such as controls on the budget deficit and the growth of money supply, it even regressed.&quot; It blamed this on the policy thrust of the budget which Babangida said would put the country &quot;on the threshold of a new era of a healthier, sustained development process.&quot; That budget adopted moderate inflation as a way of stimulating growth in the economy, and providing the human face and milk of human kindness, which Olusegun Obasanjo, a general and former head of state, said it lacked. The report said this sowed the seed for the abandonment of the programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report listed other factors as the growing unrest in the labour and students circles, rising food prices, fiscal and monetary in discipline, lowering of interest rates and the failure of government to adjust petroleum prices upwards. &quot;Not only was the reflationary budget of 1988, the first major policy backslide, but it also undermined progress in other areas of reforms,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the momentum was lost, the bank said government was largely unable to steady the reforms on course. Political considerations gave way to sound economic reasoning. Extra-budgetary spending increased the budgetary deficit. This in turn affected the value of the local currency and raised the level of inflation in the economy. Once it deviated from the path of the reform, the gains began to diminish. By mid-1989, the report said government had shifted attention from economic to political reforms, which resulted in a decline in &quot;the quality and consistency of economic policy making.&quot; The windfall from oil earnings during the Gulf War only accelerated the pace of abandonment of the reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between mid 1989 and 1992, the report noted that &quot;government totally yielded to political pressures, and despite repeated official pronouncements that it would continue with reforms, it could not sustain the original objectives of the structural adjustment programme and instead, implemented ad-hoc policies to meet short-term expenditures. The most serious issues were unrestrained public spending and irresponsible fiscal behaviour.&quot; Since 1990, the World Bank noted that &quot;the government has fallen even further behind in implementing the reform programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report in a way admitted the failure of its standardised prescriptions to effectively tackle the economic ills of a society. In the Nigerian example, the bank admitted its failure to appreciate the complexity of implementing structural reforms alongside fundamental political reforms as well as the need for a consistent political will that will see the reforms through. &quot;This political context of reforms in Nigeria,&quot; the report noted, &quot;proved to be more complex than either the World Bank or the government expected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It noted for instance, that in the design and implementation of the programme, the government &quot;had a short-run outlook that foreclosed thinking about benefits in the medium and long run.&quot; The effect of this is that policies and programmes were adopted and implemented more as interim strategies than permanent solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The absence of transparency, especially in the administration of oil revenue and the emphasis placed on expensive capital projects such as the Aluminium Smelter projects at Ikot Abasi, the Ajaokuta Steel Complex and the petrochemical project phase two projects, which the bank described as unviable projects, were seen as major pitfalls in the implementations process. Whereas the government had anticipated the SAP would encourage large inflow of new investment, the report said new investment in the economy remained low. It blamed this on the lack of accountability and poorly informed investments by government. Manufacturing investments by the private sector too remains low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Achievements in such other areas as fiscal and monetary controls were unspectacular. Inflation was on the rise, from 5.7 percent in 1986 to 11.4 percent in 1987 and nearly 54.5 percent by 1988. It fell to 50.4 percent in 1989 and by 1991, stood at 13 percent. It blamed this on the huge budget deficit. Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, figures released recently, however, differ slightly. It said that inflation between 1986 and 1987 averaged 7.8 percent, a year. It went up to 30.8 percent between 1988-92 and by November 1993, stood at 56.2 percent. Fiscal deficits also grew during the period, the CBN said. Between 1988-91, it was 10.5 percent of GDP, moving up to 12.4 percent in 1992 and may have exceeded 15 percent by the end of 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank said SAP made the greatest gain in the area of exchange rate reforms. &quot;What has been most remarkable is the sustained devaluation of the naira's external value between 1985 and 1992, from 1988 to 1992, the quarterly average of the naira exchange rate per US dollar depreciated by 27 percent, 58 percent, 61 percent, 67 percent and 83 percent over the 1987 period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Paul Ogwuma, governor of CBN, this depreciation still left the country without a realistic exchange rate. Said he: &quot;The objective of reasonable exchange rate stability was not achieved. Although the relatively large depreciation of the naira exchange rate in 1986 and 19487 were to some extent expected, (given the evident overvaluation of the currency before then), the subsequent sizeable downward movements could not be attributed to pre-SAP overvaluation but largely to increased demand relative to supply of foreign exchange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the CBN notes that the central rate depreciated by 12.6 and 38 percents in 1988 and 1989 but was much less unstable in 1990 and 1991.  It dropped by 48 and 20.6 percent in 1992 and 1993. The goals of devaluation were to discourage imports by making them more expensive, encourage domestic production and the in-flow of foreign capital. The bank's position has remained that devaluation will create new wealth for the Nigerian economy.  However, this has not been the case. Devaluation, according to experts, does not often create the prosperity its proponents claim. Recently, Bill Clinton, the United States president had declared that no &quot;country can devalue its way to prosperity,&quot; nor can they systematic devaluation of the naira which SAP brought about help to strengthen the local currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogwuma, said this much when he reviewed the performance of the monetary sector under SAP. &quot;Despite the reforms so far, the naira exchange rate has remained unstable and, therefore, not conducive to planning.&quot; The World Bank did not, however, say whether the depreciation resulted in a realistic value of the naira. Rather, it said that excess money in the system fueled demand for foreign exchange, thus widening the gap between demand and supply, &quot;from a mere $360 million in the first 10 months of the second-tier foreign exchange market to $15 billion in 1987 and $17.5 billion in 1990.&quot; it noted that what could have been a great success for the reform programme was again stunted by inconsistencies in implementation as well as contradictory movement in related policies like fiscal deficits and interest rate regulation. &quot;Overall, progress in foreign exchange reform was good, but lack of reforms in fiscal policies and monetary control nullified the progress to some extent. Excess liquidity, weak implementation capacity and interest group pressure were cases of the government's failure to stabalise the exchange rate and domestic inflation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CBN agrees largely with the verdict of the World Bank on the performance of SAP. Said Ogwuma late last year. &quot;In spite of some gains made through CBN's role in Nigeria's recent economic reforms, the designed objectives, such as stability and rapid growth with minimal unemployment, are still elusive.&quot; It said that the successes, especially in the critical reform areas such as monetary as fiscal reforms have been constrained by a number of factors. This, it said, included the rapid growth in liquidity with attendant effect on the naira exchange rate and domestic price levels, high interest rates, government deficit financing through direct borrowing from the CBN, inadequate inflow of foreign exchange and exchange rate depreciation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lessons from the Nigerian experience, the report said, are quite instructive. The implementation of SAP created a lot of pains and severe deterioration in the quality of social services. For instance, it noted that drugs could no longer be imported for hospitals. Fees were introduced in schools and hospitals while school enrollment doubled. It noted that while SAP was designed to increase the share of public expenditure on the social sector. This led to deductions in government allocations to these sectors and accelerated the level of deterioration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bank noted that the real food prices declined during the adjustment years and the position of the poor improved during the SAP period.  However, increases in prices of petroleum products resulted in increase in transportation costs and cost of other services. Although, the government introduced some palliatives, they were inadequate to ameliorate the pains.  Under SAP, the objective was to increase the share of public expenditure for human resources, but this proved difficult. For instance, allocation to the sector declined by 21 percent in 1981 to 13 percent in 1988. The report dismissed government's SAP relief packages such as transport subsidies, public employment programmes through the National Directorate of Employment, NDE, and allowances for government workers as &quot;wasteful,&quot; because they were ad hoc and not well-designed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAP betrayed the hope of Nigerians for a glorious future. In supporting the programme, the bank said Nigerians wanted to endure the &quot;interim hardship from the austerity programme, in the hope that broadly based political reforms would create a more equitable distribution of growth benefits at the end of the interim austerity.&quot; Instead, Nigerians now have to live with that, hope betrayed. The lesson from Nigerian and other countries covered in the study is &quot;that whenever adjustment programmes have been pursued vigourously, results have been clearly positive with respect to both growth and alleviation of poverty... Too frequent, abrupt and unpredictable changes and reversals of policies erode the credibility of the programmes, intensify uncertainties and weaken investors confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stability, continuity and predictability of policies play an important role in the success of reforms,&quot; said the report. These, Nigeria lacked. And they helped to render the reforms ineffective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Christine Sellin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crowning Achievements: African Arts of Dressing the Head&quot; features traditional and contemporary hats, headdresses and hairstyles from Africa, exploring their aesthetic richness, keen artistry and symbolic ingenuity. In recognition of Black History Month, &quot;Crowning Achievements&quot; opens Feb. 5 and continues through July 16, 1995 at UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Composed of a staggering array of shapes and an enormous range of materials, the exhibition represents a cross-cultural survey of Africa's dynamic arts of personal adornment. Dating from the early 1800s to present-day, more than 150 objects examine the significance of headwear across Africa and the African Diaspora.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These works of art illustrate how people use hats to construct social identities, and to enhance and transform their lives,&quot; said Mary Jo Arnoldi, curator of African ethnology at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, who served as the project's visiting co-curator with colleague Christine Mullen Kreamer, visiting curator at the Museum of Natural History. &quot;Headwear is one of the most inventive art forms to come out of Africa, or any other part of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa, as in many cultures, hats and hair can define social status, age or gender and transmit important messages about the attitudes, values and beliefs that shape the human experience. The exhibition interprets headwear with an emphasis on individual identity, exploring the material artistry, spiritual value, historical origins and stylistic influences of the objects. Related clothing and appurtenances, lively, painted African headressing signs and photographic blow-ups embellish the presentation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an introductory section, the exhibition commences with an in-depth view of 12 provocative hats that represent a wide geographic range of cultural styles, employ a diversity of materials and exhibit spectacular technical expertise. These include a Yoruba beaded crown, a Gola fiber hat, a Sudanese chain mail helmet, an Ethiopian silver crown and a Herero women's leather headdress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like hats, hairstyles are excellent vehicles for visual expression as examined in the next section, &quot;Head and Hair.&quot; Some 55 distinctive objects, including elaborate wigs, hairpieces, hairpins, combs, headrests and painted barber shop and salon signs, comprise this portion of the exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fourth and fifth sections present two groupings of headwear: informal or everyday wear and special- occasion wear. Aesthetically and regionally diverse, these hats speak to issues of style and symbolism, purpose and personhood. Though beautiful in form and technique, everyday wear tends toward durable, affordable solutions, such as hats made from calabashes incised with curvilinear designs; or those miraculously transformed from reeds, grasses and tree fibers, such as the tightly-woven basketry cap from Madagascar. Conversely, dress for special occasions involves the use of precious or exotic materials, with a high degree of decorative embellishment that convey power, wealth and prestige. Whether intended for kings, brides or diviners, hats may fulfill a multitude of social and religious functions. For example, headwear can serve as a visual metaphor for political power associated with leadership, such as the exuberantly beaded bicorn chief's headdress made by the Pende people of Zaire. Alluding to the strength of the buffalo, the headdress has horns on each side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sculptural art of wrapping the head, featuring men's and women's head ties and turbans that highlight the elegant, volumnic expressions of this widespread custom in Africa, comprises the sixth section of the exhibition. The Yoruba of southern Nigeria are recognized throughout West Africa for the beautiful head ties worn included in the exhibition illustrate the artistic splendor of this custom and reflect how the practice of wrapping the head relates to Yoruba philosophical notions about the sacredness of the head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headwear can serve as important material symbols of rank and title.  Issues of status are investigated in the seventh segment of the exhibition, which compares the full range of headgear used by two societies in Zaire, the Kuba and the Lega. Among the Kuba, title-taking is central to social life. An initiated adult man has the right to wear a small conical cap, laket, but more elaborated versions of this cap are reserved for those with additional titles. For example, the version of the laket worn by titled soldiers is embellished with large tufts of raffia fiber. Among the Lega, high-ranking men and women in the Bwami association-- a social organization of which nearly all Lega adults are members--wear distinctive hats as markers of their elevated status. Men who have achieved the highest level of status call themselves &quot;Elephant Tail Folks,&quot; and wear an elaborate hat made of fiber, shells and cowries surmounted by an elephant tail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition concludes with a look at the significant impact that African styles have had on the Western fashion world, tracing contemporary trans-Atlantic connections between Africa and America. Hats made of Ghanaian kente cloth or Bamana mud-cloth from Mali, and the Islamic-inspired cloth skullcap have hit the urban fashion scene both within and outside the continent. A selection of hats from the African marketplace in Los Angeles offers an excellent case study of the range of African-influenced headwear available for sale in a major American city. These hats reveal affinities with Egypt, African Islam, Senegal and Jamaican Rastafarianism, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accompanied by a 185-page catalogue, the exhibition was organized by the Fowler Museum and includes objects selected from the museum's holdings as well as from several private collections. &quot;Crowning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Achievements&quot; is held in conjunction with its companion presentation,&quot;Coiffure Moderne: A Gallery of African Hairstyles, 1970-1990&quot; which features hand-painted, African headressing signs from Gabon, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire. &quot;Coiffure Moderne&quot; opens on March 5 and continues through July 16, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fowler Museum's hours are Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 5 p.m.; Thursday until 8 p.m. Admission is free. For general information call (310) 825-4361.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">December 8, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Suelle Nachif</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All art can be said to have two sweeping characteristics; it embodies a message within an idiom of communication, and it appears to the intellect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good&quot; art is that which, no matter what its cultural origins or uses, can arouse the sense of mystery in many persons, from many cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa has an extensive &quot;good&quot; art; its ineffable quality can be widely perceived, and it has taken its place in museums and in collections of many art lovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art bears a &quot;message&quot; from artist to viewer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The message is carried out within an idiom that, like language, can be broken down into a sort of grammar- the parts of a sculpture, or the parts of music, analogous to the parts of speech. Art then may be valued either as a message-bearing comment or as a mystery. It may in fact be valued for both of these things at once.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mystery of good art cuts across cultural barriers, the message probably does not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to appreciate the art fully, something of the cultural background must be known to make the message clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art is of essence in analysing culture, because it supplies the media in which some of the most perceptive and original thinkers in any society communicate their experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Art includes communication, comments, and criticism. The critics translate for the people who may have less perceptive vision, what it is that the artist is saying- the postulate that lies behind his message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African art can be understood on three levels: it can be studied as form and technique. In the second place, the purpose and the meaning-the aesthetics. And thirdly, African art can be evaluated for its impact on western (or some other) art, an impact on western (or some other) art, an impact that was, earliest and strongest, that of the mystery rather than that of message.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forms of African Art-The main forms of African art that have been widely known are limited to sculpture and music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African music is coming into its own and has several specific contributions to make.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most dramatic of the special attributes is its polyrhythmic structure. Polyrhythms are complex combinations of fairly simple but different rhythms, all played concurrently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African dancing has been for a long time one of the favourite sights of the tourist in Africa, for its quality and artistic achievement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each part of the dancer's body accompanying one of the rhythms in the orchestra is reproduced by the dancer's body.  The head moves in one rhythm; the shoulders in another; the arms in the third; the trunk in another; and the feet still in another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the viewers learn to see and feel the polyrhythms in the dance as it reflects the music, they can appreciate that African dancing demands both precision and allows freedom of expression to the dancers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African painting has a very long history. The earliest cave paintings go back several thousand years, but have not been dated with any great precision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the earliest are huge representations of human beings; 11 feet high and animals as much as 26 feet lone. Rock paintings are still done today, but the figures are miniature rather than the gigantic murals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;African Sculpture&quot; The best known of African arts is its sculpture.  Most African sculpture, except that done in Terra Cotta, is produced by a subtractive process material taken away from a core instead of added to a core.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soap stone carvings are found in areas of Sierre Leone, iron sculpture in several places in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory was a favourite medium in Benin and the Congo. However the major media for African sculptures are wood and various alloys of copper, tin, zinc, bronze and brass. Wood working is done with an adze and is finished with a knife. Bronzes are all cast by the lost wax method. In this method, the technique is fundamentally additive, rather than subtractive, as it is in a carving. The earliest sculpture that we know to be unequivocally African comes from the Nok culture. The distribution of Nok is a fairly narrow area between Katsina and Katsina Ala in northern Nigeria. Nok art as it is known, is almost entirely pottery or Terra Cotta art. Origins and histories of individual art styles and forms can, of course, be usefully made; but &quot;the origin&quot; is too amorphous a question, as art is a form of communication, and therefore grows with culture and develops; it has always been so and it will always be so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Various Expressions-African art is interwoven with daily life, religious beliefs and cultural ideals which are expressed, and created artistical figures primarily for ceremonial purposes, and also in the practical objects of day- to-day existence, and in the role of art as an agent for social and economic development. A historical examination of traditional art, a recognition that it is more dynamic than we formerly thought and a close look at the changes of recent decades, lead us to recast our image of traditional art in a less romantic and idealised light, and to see it as perhaps more profoundly different from recent art of the West than we have thus far recognised. Viewing the traditional arts of African historical perspective throws into relief certain qualities that are not usually emphasised, in so far as one can generalise about so vast a field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A consistent and important feature of seems always to have appreciated and rewarded unusual new interpretations of their inherited art forms whether on the level of relatively minor innovations in form and in iconography or occasionally in the wholesale exportation of new art forms from neighbouring people often substantially adapted. It now appears that many entertainment masquerade- the characters, names, songs and dance were invented by young men and women to comment upon current events. They remained in use as long as their generation performed them and then were replaced by the next generation's inventions in a similar mode. When successor generations decline to produce a new version, the genre becomes extinct. The National Council for Arts and Culture demonstrates that traditional art continues to be re-created, thanks to its capacity to change, and to absorb new ideas and situations- the flexibility apparent in traditional art today sheds new light on the traditional artists of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Council for Arts and Culture proposes that the traditional arts and cultural activities past, present and near future be defined as those in which the community views the artists essentially as transmitters of received forms; and that though those artists are and were rarely anonymous in the true sense, their identity is and was usually of little interest. Their personal contribution to the creation of a work art was seen as subordinate to the role played by the commissioner of the work or by subsequent owners. The traditional artists often collaborate with clients and others, including other artists in the production of art works, therefore it is the role of the National Council for Arts and Culture to make sure the preservation, promotions and developments are well implemented and monitored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uncorrupted African Art-African art today cannot be seen as corrupted, for it was never pure, never homogeneous and never isolated, rather in The Gambia as elsewhere in time of change, individuals and societies have taken charge of their artistic expressions- they have selected artistic forms and ideas from the multitude available to them and have changed and changed their artistic repertoire. As the twentieth century reaches a close, African artists like forebears before us, have chosen to renew useful old forms to take on new ones and to cast off others in an ongoing (process of organic decay and renewal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">December 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Alfred Logune Taban</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;peace from within&quot; option is a consequence of the absence of a peace agreement with the SPLA on the one hand, and the military successes scored by government forces in the field on the other. Many of the Sudanese displaced by fighting in Southern Kordofan, the Blue Nile region and southern states have become convinced that if they are to wait until an agreement is signed before returning to their homes, they may stay displaced indefinitely.  Besides, life hasn't been at all easy in the area where most of them have been displaced. Those in Khartoum, for example, have complained of among other things a lack of employment, transport difficulties, poor housing and the high cost of living.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has resulted in an influx of the displaced back to their areas of origin. Their return has been made easier by the relative state of law and order which has been restored to several parts of Southern Sudan and Southern Kordofan. Since March 1992, government forces have recaptured about 16 towns and villages from the SPLA, and although fighting is still going on, it is confined to much fewer areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In cooperation with the Commission for the Displaced (COD), the Sudan Council of Churches (SCC) has repatriated over 20,000 Southern Sudanese since 1990. It has sent 4,000 persons to Juba alone since the middle of last year, and was planning in late October to organise at least four more trips to repatriate at least another 2,000. Besides Juba, destinations of the displaced include Renk, Bentiu, Wad-Dakona, Meriam, Abyei and Safa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SCC normally provides each returnee with 2 pots, plates and water cups, one washbasin, five pieces of soap and a number of food items.  Additionally, a sum of Ls. 3,000 is given to each of them on arrival.  Initially there was fear that some of the displaced would quickly rush back to Khartoum on discovering that life is not that much easier in their areas of origin. SCC officials say however that no-one has returned, and almost all those repatriated went straight back to their villages and homes or joined relatives and friends, and are not dependent upon relief. Some are now busily engaged in reconstruction work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late October, President Al-Bashir described the repatriation as a success, telling senior figures in the national media that some of those who had returned to Wad-Dakona in Northern Upper Nile State have been earning yearly incomes averaging Ls. 600,000 for the cultivation and collection of gum arabic. The president added that those who returned to Bahr Al-Jebel have also been positively engaged in cultivation and rehabilitation of their villages, but stressed that the government has now to provide the returnees with essential services such as schools and medical centres in order to bring stability, development and trade-internal and cross-border-to areas that were once the scene of fierce fighting. Peace villages have been established in parts of Southern Sudan and Southern Kordofan- those in Southern Kordofan in particular have been provided with almost al essential services and can even boast tractors. It is hoped that services such as these will attract those still resident in rebel-held areas to the peace villages, where they can expect to live a life of near-normality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another component of the &quot;peace from within&quot; option, say government officials, is the negotiations with SPLA commanders in the field with the aim of striking regional peace agreements that would also help to bring stability to parts, if not all, of Southern Sudan. For this reason, all ten southern states have an additional minister for peace and reconstruction. Part of the brief of these ministers is establishing the contacts necessary to initiate this internal dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consolidation of federal rule is also seen by many as being crucial for the realisation of &quot;peace from within&quot;. Since 1947, southerners have been calling for a federal system of government to enable them to rule themselves. This has now been granted to them. The argument goes that if southerners living inside Sudan are content, then peace is guaranteed; if not, stability cannot be assured, even if a settlement were reached with the SPLA. The success of federal rule and the popular desire for the return of stability to rebuild broken lives is also expected to put pressure on the SPLA to make amends at the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formation in late September of a 88-member Select Council for Peace, under the tutelage of President Al-Bashir, is also being seen as another measure to support the &quot;peace from within&quot; option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While appealing to many people inside the country, the &quot;peace from within&quot; option is however unlikely to bring lasting peace to the country. The SPLA is still armed, and has the capacity to create instability in many parts of Southern Sudan and Southern Kordofan. What's more, it still takes orders for the most part from leaders who are based outside the country. Therefore, the &quot;peace from within&quot; option must go hand-in-hand with negotiations with the SPLA until such time as a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement is reached.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan Democratic Gazette</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Bona Malwal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what must be regarded as a milestone achievement, the SPLA and the Umma Party signed a formal agreement on 12 December, committing themselves to political cooperation, working for the restoration of freedom and democracy, and recognising the right of the South to Self-determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the most important agreement for many years concerning relations between the North and the South in Sudan. It has come at an opportune moment when the debate over Self-determination is at the forefront of any political discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without doubt, the Umma Party has shown great courage in breaking away from the more traditional view held by Northern political parties. The agreement confirms that the party is committed to finding a peaceful solution to the conflict in Sudan, and is no longer prepared to use force to maintain the unity of the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Gazette&quot; strongly endorses this agreement and urges all those who wish Sudan well to do likewise. However, we hasten to add that the agreement on its own will not cure all of the country's ills. The problems are both chronic and complex. The agreement is a highly significant first step towards getting to the root cause of the problems, which is why it is important to rally the support of other political groupings to the basic text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the agreement has been criticised by groupings in both North and South. The Umma Party has been attacked by traditional and conservative elements in the North who have always viewed southern Sudanese as a people to be controlled rather than won as partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the SPLA and the Umma Party have called on the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) to join them in the agreement and to show leadership at this crucial time. Although the NDA has not in the past shown a great deal of leadership for the opposition in the struggle to overthrow the Khartoum regime, it should now respond positively to bring all the opposition groupings behind the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations behind the agreement were never easy because there are a number of areas on which the two parties disagree. Foremost among these is the question of Self-determination for the Ngok Dinka people of Abyei, the Nuba Mountains and the Ingessina Hills. Colonial administrators placed these areas in the geographical North of Sudan, and so the Umma Party is reluctant to grant them such a right. The SPLA argues that these areas have become so marginalised in the North that they have earned the right by taking up arms against their oppressors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disagreement on this point is understandable, yet the &quot;Gazette&quot; must add its weight to the SPLA position. The North has done very little over the past forty years to merit the continuing attachment of these areas to it without first giving the people a say in their own future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties have set up a technical committee to work out the details of future constitutional and administrative arrangements on which they disagree. Much work has already been carried out on these matters but much more remains to be worked out, to avoid controversy at a later date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It now remains for the Southerners outside of the SPLA to endorse the agreement. The sooner this is done then the sooner the debate over separation or the confederation of the South with the North can begin in earnest.  Without such a healthy debate, it will be difficult to arrive at a correct decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the individual level, it has to be noted that the agreement would not have been possible without the personal courage displayed by the two Umma Party leaders, Dr. Omer Nur El Dayem and Mubarak El Fadil El Mahdi. Both men broke the Northern establishment mould by traveling to Southern Sudan to finalise and sign the agreement there with the SPLA leaders. They not only put their reputations on the line but also their lives when they entered the war zone. They have greatly contributed to the search for a just solution to Sudan's problems by showing the way forward to others in the Northern political establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally I wish to thank the leadership of the SPLA for granting Aldo Adjou Deng and myself the honour and privilege of participating in their team during the negotiation process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 4-6, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Yoweri Museveni has announced a major overhead of the organisation and procedures for divestiture of parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A press release issued by State House yesterday says the new measures, among others, shall see greater transparency, line ministries ceding authority over parastatals under them, the scrapping of the Public Enterprises Reform and Divestiture Secretariat (PERD) and, a new target of full transfer to the private sector of at least 85 percent of all parastatals by 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes take immediate effect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State House release says that the measure aim at increasing investment in key sectors and reducing the burden of inefficient public enterprises on the economy. It says there is a need to streamline the procedures for divestiture which are unnecessarily cumbersome and are a deterrent to potential investors. They also aim at &quot;imposing financial controls on parastatals, which still represent a substantial drain on the budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of State for Finance &amp; Economic Planning Matthew Rukikaire, will now be in charge of the divestiture and privatisation programme, in addition to performing other duties already assigned to him in the Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Presidential also directed that the Divestiture Reform Implementation Committee (DRIC) will not be involved in any negotiations with investors or bid review, for which the Minister of State will be responsible.  DRIC will, however, continue to approve the final transfer of an enterprise or shares to bidders as required by the Statue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister of Finance and Economic Planning has also been directed to transfer to the Ministry of Finance all shares of parastatals slated for divestiture, with the temporary exception of statutory corporations for which amendment of Acts of Parliament is needed. Line ministries, therefore, will cease to have any authority with respect to those parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Enterprise Reform and Divestiture Secretariat (PERD) and the Policy Review Working Group (PRWG) will be dismantled and replaced by a Parastatal Monitoring Unit headed by the Secretary to the Treasury to monitor financial policy with respect to parastatals, and a Privatisation Unit will handle all matters relating to divestiture, with transparent criteria for bid evaluation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President has further directed the Minister of Finance and Economic Planning to increase transparency and objectivity in all divestiture procedures. All parastatals shall be submitted to a full legal and financial audit conducted by independent auditors and lawyers before they are advertised for sale. The current level of debt and the cost of possible retrenchment should be estimated in addition to the value of the company as a going concern. The information will then be used to determine the divestiture method to be followed (i.e. liquidation when debts are larger than assets; sale of shares through the outright sale; pre-emption rights etc.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements shall follow a standard format.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The release concludes by stating that the target of the divestiture programme has been revised to achieve full transfer to the private sector of at least 85 percent of all parastatals by the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi Chief Magistrate's court will start hearing preliminary objections in the Sh18 billion Goldenburg case filed by the Law Society of Kenya against former CBK Governor Eric Kotut and five others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move followed consensus yesterday by all counsel, who included Deputy Public Prosecutor Bernard Chunga, appearing for the Attorney-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Paul Muite, leading the prosecution team applied for the adjournment in the suit against Mr. Kotut former Treasury Permanent Secretary C.S. Mbindyo and W.K. Koinanga, Commissioner for Mines, C.O. Owayu, Commissioner for Customs A.K. Cheruiyot and businessman Kamlesh Pattni .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said counsel wanted to get out of the way preliminary issues before embarking on full hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six accused were present during the brief morning session. The court was packed to capacity by relatives, friends and sympathisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LSK is seeking to institute criminal proceedings against the six men in connection with a Sh18 billion theft from the Central Bank of Kenya on different dates between October 1990 and December 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldenberg International Limited has also been enjoined in the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, Mr. Ishan Kapila, for Mr. Owayo, has filed an affidavit notifying the LSK that his client would oppose the society's application for permission to conduct the private prosecution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kapila joins the Attorney General in questioning the LSK's legal right to institute the private criminal prosecution. He filed the notice on Monday citing three (reasons) for the objection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer says the LSK has not established that the AG has expertly, or by conduct, declined, neglected or refused to institute criminal proceedings against the suspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also not established that it has &quot;locus standi&quot; (right to sue) in that the scope of its functions are provided in the LSK Act (Cap 18 Laws of Kenya) does not include the institution and conduct of criminal proceedings on behalf of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dr. Willy Mutunga, the LSK chairman, has filed an affidavit maintaining the society has a &quot;locus standi&quot; in the matter on behalf of Kenyans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The LSK, adds Dr. Mutunga, has the right to prosecute because it's a major taxpayer, having remitted S10 million to the public offers between 19991 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kapila, in his notice, claims that the LSK has not established that it has suffered any injury or damage or it has sufficient (funds) to enable it to institute the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The matter is being heard by Chief Magistrate Uniter Panella Kidullah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence team includes Mr. Salim Dhanji, Mr. A.R. Kapila, Mr.  Mohamed Nyaoga, Mr.Byron Georgiadis, Mr. M.G. Sharna and Mr. Moses Kurgat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Muite is teaming up with Mr. Pheroze Mowrojee, Mr. Mbuthi Gathanji and Mr. Muangi Mbuthia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chunga is assisted by Principal State Counsel Horace Olumu.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All military rulers are grandly devoid of political ambition. But they find, poor people, the burden of political leadership forced on them by politicians who have problems with getting their acts right. As military men, sworn to the defence of the fatherland and its constitution, they can't shirk this great responsibility in their nation's hours of need. So, they accept the challenge and take on the burden. Patriotism demands nothing less from the patriotic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one can objectively accuse a military ruler of plans to stay in power indefinitely. In case anyone is so inclined, military rulers make it a point of honour, if not duty, to reassure the people they (the rulers, that is) do not intend to stay in office a day longer than necessary. Meaning, they appreciate that people on a rescue mission don't like to hang around when the mission has been accomplished. That requires some explanation. Days are necessary to right the wrongs, to solve the mountain of problems left by the politicians and chart a new course for the nation. One of these days is accepted as the last day necessary to accomplish the aforesaid task. If a military ruler stays beyond it, then those who accuse him of ambition to do what comes to politicians by right of being politicians, are right. In our national experience, no military ruler in this country has breached this code of honour. They all strove to stay within the days necessary. Those who came after them still do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, how come there are problems with the days necessary? Part of the problem arises from the fact that there is no constitutional provision stipulating the tenure of a military ruler. How long he stays in power is, to reiterate, dictated by the problems he met and which he must, for love of country, tackle. As you very well know (at least, you should) problems of a country come in various sizes. Small problems as such as fixing the value of the naira, take only a few days. Medium-sized problems such as writing a new constitution (the social contract no modern country, except Britain, wants to be without) take many more days. A ginormous (gigantic and enormous) problem such as returning a country to democratic rule, takes the largest number of days. That is why there is always a dress rehearsal on the way to those final days. Now, if you add all these days together, you will see what a Herculean task it is to find the days necessary days within which every military ruler wants to meet the enormous challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some help from external sources does become both inevitable and desirable. The fact that the late General Murtala Muhammed worked out his own tenure and his successor, General Olusegun Obasanjo, stuck to it, does not invalidate this fact. It only means that some military men are better at working out necessary days than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ibrahim Babangida, whose regime was not an offshoot of the Murtala/Obsanjo regime, needed external assistance. He set up a political bureau to lend him such a hand. The bureau, in the course of finding an untried and untested political system suitable for a country whose political peculiarities made both the Westminster and the American-type executive presidential system unsuitable, was asked to attach to its finding just how many days were necessary for the military to stay in power. Ambivalence over military rule divided members of the bureau. And the majority did not carry the vote. The minority report of the political bureau stretched the necessary days by a couple of years. Government went along with the wisdom inherent in that recommendation. The rest, as they say, is now history. Indeed so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sani Abacha, a general, stepped in November 17 last year, he too appreciated the enormity of the challenges he had to face and the burden he had to carry. It was, therefore, wise of him to decide, as he did, that he needed a little help from our representatives in the constitutional conference to tell him how many days are necessary for him to accomplish this task. He took some flak for this. Critics, as uninformed as they usually are, did not appreciate the rationale for his action. They said how could the constitutional conference which was not a party to the decision to take over be the right and appropriate organ to determine the number of days necessary for the general to fix the problems of the country. They said the general was merely passing the buck. The general said they were wrong. He said fixing the problems of the nations was the challenge he had accepted but that how long it would take him to do that can best be determined through, well, a 'vox populi', as in constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, a committee of the constitutional conference which studied the enormity of our economic, political and other problems, carefully calculated that Abacha needs the days stretching between November 17, 1993 and December 31, 1997 to fix our national problems. Any days after those would be days longer than necessary. But in this case, the majority refused to accord the minority the right of being right. So it was that the recommendation was thrown out. In their collective wisdom, the delegates to the conference determined that the days necessary for the general should be between November 17, 1993 and December 31, 1995. Any more days would be days unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Have the people spoken? The next few days will tell what the government makes of it. But you must remember that politics is not about being right or wrong. It is about being knowing what to make of the question at any given point in time. As someone said, the answer to two plus two depends on either what you are calculating or the circumstances of your calculation. In other words, who you agree with on how long or short necessary days should be for military rule, may depend as much on how many hours make one day as in what you make of the ends of power - that ultimate desire of all men and women.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 9, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Ray Ekpu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, better known as M.K.O., is the stuff of which heroes are made. His life is a study in perseverance and that is why a man born and bred in poverty was able to scale the daunting hurdles that separate rags from riches and to get to the very pinnacle of prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born August 24, 1937, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, to a man who had (almost) lost faith in life, having lost twenty-one (21) children to the icy hands of death, and a woman who had (almost) lost faith in marriage, having lost two husbands earlier, Abiola went through the tough school of life with a single-minded dedication to a reversal of his indigent status. He hewed and sold firewood to raise money for his school fees and when this didn't take him far he formed a brass band.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you'd expect, the Kashimambo Orchestra didn't always receive a standing ovation for you did not expect a stammerer to be a great musician.  But Abiola, croaky voice or not, managed to rake up a few coins as a captain of this rag-tag orchestra. The orchestra, you need not be told, did not put out any chartbuster. And Abiola's mother died December 10, 1956, &quot;because the family was too poor to afford fifty-five (55) kobo that the doctor demanded for her treatment.&quot; If the lady had waited a few years longer, and witnessed her son's phenomenal wealth, her ailment, whatever it was, would have been treated by the best doctors in the best hospitals in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man who had a good head for figures got a government scholarship to study Accountancy at the University of Glasglow, Scotland, and returned home to work at LUTH and Pfizer before destiny wheeled him to ITT in 1968, where with the deft deployment of blackmail, bravado and business acumen he made a stupendous fortune. It was then that he struck a lucrative symbiotic relationship with the military establishment. It is a cruel irony that that institution has made and unmade him. In the last two decades, Abiola has served as a useful ally to military big-wigs in their inordinate power seizures and manipulations. They made him rich. He made them powerful. And rich too. Abiola's bastion of strength, namely the military, has paradoxically become his Achilles heel, the pin-point source of his vulnerability. They knew him at close range to be a man of ambition. But men of power are usually suspicious of men of ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Second Republic, the NPN, the party to which Abiola belonged, admired his electrifying energy at campaigns, his wise-cracks, his willingness to throw money around like confetti, his ability to break the bones of the party's enemies in his newspapers but there's one thing they did not admire in him; his political ambition. They'd be happy to grant him more contracts if he wanted, or add to his paraphernalia of titles or grant him other indulgences provided he'd amputate his political ambition. When in 1980 he desired to overthrow Adisa Akinloye, the NPN chairman, the campaign slogan was that they didn't want to have two presidents in one country so Abiola had to lose. A few years later when Abiola wanted to challenge Shehu Shagari for the NPN presidential nomination, Umara Dikko was to tell Abiola that the presidency was not for sale to the highest bidder, so Abiola had to lose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If civilians bruised him out of the power orbit, he had reason to believe that his friends, the military, may thrust him into it, particularly since he had in times past done a few dirty jobs for them. But power is a charming maiden. No man surrenders it to another except he has to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That lesson, Abiola had to learn June 12, 1993, as he was coasting home victorious in the presidential election and the talking drums were talking, then the military brought the march past of jubilating voters to a stop by wiping off the election. Nigerians may have thought they had found their hero, albeit an imperfect hero, a man full of the milk of human kindness. They reasoned: if he gave out his private wealth to the poor and the needy, he would do much more with Nigeria's wealth. A Santa Claus was about to come to power and all the year round it would be Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Abiola became an amputated hero the moment he fled the land in the night, the moment he came up with the fatalistic lamentation that Allah gives power to those He wants to, the moment he hid under the Fabian philosophy of avoiding the battle. He forgot the other philosophy, &quot;Who dares wins,&quot; or its companion, &quot;Nothing venture, nothing win.&quot; A year later, he throws his lethargy aside, he wears the toga of a bull-fighter, he challenges the lion to a duel, he says he wants his due, the presidency, and they say to themselves: &quot;Hei, this guy is a loose cannon.&quot; So, they put him away in prison, put the key somewhere and play cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola is a desperate man. Desperate men are products of confusion.  Juxtapose these: Abiola writes love letters to Ibrahim Babangida, the architect of his predicament. Abiola lavishes praise on Sani Abacha and tells the man to take over the government; he tells his compatriots they could serve the military government that is sitting where he should have been sitting. Then he swings round; he fights for his freedom; he'd accept no conditions for bail, he'd rather die in prison, a striving to regain his lost heroism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abiola is not Nelson Mandela. He cannot be, his is too rich, too cowardly, too fickle, to be a Mandela. But he is, in a sense, a hero, a hero of Nigeria's political revolution, albeit a tragic, reluctant hero.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honorable Delegates,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would like to address these themes in my remarks: 1. The domestic challenges to bring about peace and security at home, 2. The challenges for bringing about peace and security in the region, 3. The way to development, 4. International cooperation 5. Marginalization Domestic Peace and Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges that a new country face to lay the foundations for enduring peace and security and the prospects for achieving them cannot, I believe, be addressed and gauged in isolation. Inexorable trends towards regional and continental integration that pervade contemporary thinking and the underlying international setting towards increased global interdependence militate against such conventional, linear approaches. A cursory view of the causes, incidence and intensity of conflicts at the continental level will thus be necessary in order to provide a broader picture of the challenges that have been surmounted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's past and present record in this regard is however perplexing.  Africa has witnessed no less than 47 intensive and low intensity conflicts over the past thirty years after the first wave of political independence from European colonial rule in the 1960s. A disproportionate number of them, 89%, happen to be civil conflicts within the post-colonial independent African state. And, so as not to have a lapse in our collective memories, we also have the Rwandan, Somali, Liberian and Angolan tragedies that are still raging at this very hour. What are the causes of these conflicts?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deep-rooted historical factors, legacies of colonialism, underdevelopment and political mismanagement have all contributed with varying degrees and intensity, to over heat Africa's political caldron and breed a situation of perennial tension and civil strife. Modern African states have not been allowed to evolve in accordance with the internal dynamics of nation-building. In the Berlin Conference's scramble for Africa, the powers that drew arbitrary borders, sometimes dispersing ethnic units across several contiguous new states, thereby sowing the seeds of future conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The colonial powers often pursued divisive policies of uneven development both for reasons of short- term economic exploitation and with the willful desire to keep their subjects divided and at loggerheads with each other. The local elite who acceded to power after independence were less interested in addressing these imbalances, wedded as they were to the values, aspirations and perceptions of their colonial mentors. As it happened, internal cleavages along ethnic lines, nepotism ands exclusiveness became more pronounced in independent Africa. Moreover, post-colonial Africa almost invariably suffered from the malaise of poor governance. For many leaders and their close ethnic associates, political power was the short-cut for amassing wealth. As the national pie grew smaller and smaller due to Africa's failure to compete in the international market, those in power took the lion's share of dwindling natural resources through corruption and outright official theft. Public dissension could only be silenced by repression and brute force. At the other extreme, coup d'etat became the accepted norms for those who could wield a measure of support in the army but to whom the system appeared impregnable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cold War realities and geopolitical considerations compounded this state of affairs as the major Western powers and the former Soviet Union supported and abetted notorious tyrants to promote broader strategic interests. How can we reverse these realities to ensure continued peace and security?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cardinal principle that we have to respect is, it seems to me, commitment to participatory politics and the cultivation of democratic traditions in all their variations. Participatory politics may lend itself to different interpretations. There are those who equate participatory politics with Western democratic values and institutions and who advocate for their wholesale and immediate transplantation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This approach is fundamentally flawed. Nor will it offer the panacea to Africa's profound problem of bad governance. Indeed, while we should acknowledge the barriers to development, stability and social well-being that tyrannies and autocracies pose, we must be flexible and imaginative in the solutions we seek to redress them. After all, we must bear in mind that Western democracies have matured through a prolonged process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was often amused by the simplicity and equanimity of knowledgeable friends and partners who were probing us about our democratization process after the referendum and the formal independence of Eritrea. A constitution-drafting process of two years and a transition period of four years to prepare the ground for parliamentary democracy seemed unduly long for many of them, including seasoned politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many also felt that regulating party politics within the confines of our realities was tantamount to tampering with universal rights. And yet, this is precisely the most reliable and viable approach that we have to follow if we perceive, indeed as we should, the democratization process as a long-term engagement that must be realized over time without violent reversals and hiccups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must realize that we are starting with fragile and fragmented societies. The democratic process must therefore pass through pass through a controlled phase if these societies are not to break apart at the seams in mid-stream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pluralism must be gauged against its centrifugal potential of fragmentation along ethnic, clan and religious lines. Thus, while we should cultivate serious political differences on tangible, contentious economic and social programmes, we cannot and should not tolerate party politics that revolve around and aim to appeal to primordial sentiments of ethnic and/or religious exclusiveness. At the end of the day, this can only degenerate into the politics of hatred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To emphasize this point, for societies such as ours, the buzzword must be democratization and pluralism through a controlled process. With this caveat, however the government must be constitutional, elected and accountable. Codes of conduct to ensure transparency and stamp out corruption have to be strictly adhered to and rigorously enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the economic field, the government must pursue sound economic policies and management practices in as much as it continues to play a supplementary and catalytic role to the private sector. Institution and capacity building must be given top priority both in order to cultivate democratic values and traditions and reasons of administrative efficiency.  Human resource development, through wide access to primary and secondary education and improved health services, must be vigorously sought. These will not only ensure social mobility but concretely demonstrate to the population that they have a stake in maintaining peace and security. Participatory politics as interpreted by constructive pluralism, regional balance and human resource development is, I believe, the path we have to refine and pursue to create a conducive climate for continued economic progress and political peace and security. Regional Peace and Security</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier I touched on the indivisibility of peace and security. Indeed, it would be unrealistic to speak of an Island or oasis of peace if turmoil and mayhem abound everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Growing ,militarization, barriers to increased trade, refugee outflows, etc. will sooner or later disturb relative peace in a neighboring country if civil strife is raging across its borders. Traditional concepts of non-interference in internal conflicts are accordingly becoming increasingly tenuous, requiring timely and appropriate qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional peace and stability is moreover threatened by ambitious tyrants who crave territorial conquest under suitable labels. Irredentism, historical myths and legends, and fundamentalism have in fact been invoked at various times and by different tyrants to ignite and fuel expansionist wars in our region in the last forty years alone. External influence and prodding - Cold War exigencies, its hangover, subtle manipulation by major powers - have again played a significant part in exacerbating these wars. How can we contain and prevent future regional wars?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gradual regional economic cooperation leading to full integration is perhaps one of the realistic goals that we can pursue to create a stable regional climate. This is not a mere political imperative. Indeed, current global economic trends are rendering regional cooperation a matter of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One glaring problem that needs quick remedy is that factors such as low complimentary, weak regional and continental trade, and the virtual absence of infrastructural networks connecting different countries and regions have resulted in attributing a political rather than an economic tinge to the whole concept of economic cooperation. We thus sometimes end up with unrealistic goals such as continental economic unity - the Abuja Treaty - within the life span of this generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is essential that we pursue approaches that are both modest and realistic. At this stage, I do not think we can envisage economic cooperation other than through a modular approach. The constituent parts of these building blocks for eventual continental unity cannot follow similar or stereotyped patterns. Issues of harmonization and uniformity of pace are, I believe, secondary matters that can be addressed in due time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, such regional and sub-regional blocs can be easily formed and regrouped. IGADD, the Greater Horn of Africa Region, and COMESA can be cited in our region. They can work on concrete economic cooperation programmes which can be expanded with time. Above all, they can serve as a vehicle for political consultation and as forums for regional conflict prevention and resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter function is particularly vital. The tragedies in Somalia and Rwanda have demonstrated the inadequacy of reactive conflict resolution by the United Nations, the OAU or other international organizations physically removed from the scene. What is needed is a reliable mechanism for proactive conflict prevention and resolution. This task will require some form of early warning system to identify in advance hotbeds of potential conflict and astute diplomacy to defuse potential time bombs. (IGADD's role in seeking a solution to the problem of South Sudan is a fitting example.) Forceful intervention should only be the last recourse. There are compelling reasons to establish that most of these tasks are better carried out by regional actors and partners. &quot;The Way to Development&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy here is not on variants of market economy: whether Third World countries at the lowest rung should focus on import substitution, aim towards an export led economy or a combination of both to be able to compete in an increasingly tough global market. I believe that these are issues of detail which may obtain satisfactory answers for specific realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key parameters that have common relevance to our realities can, it seems to me, be summed up by the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii) The first prerequisite for all-rounded development is peace and security both in its domestic sense and in its regional dimension.  I have tried to elaborate this theme with sufficient detail previously.  Hence, I shall spare you extra boredom by unnecessary repetition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii) The second factor is reliance on correct and rational management of domestic resources. This factor is important for several reasons: it helps societies to live within their national means; it reduces dependency; and, more importantly, it fosters local ingenuity and industriousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iii) The third factor is effective use of foreign aid. There is much that can be said in this regard. Perhaps in absolute terms, the amount of external finance-- in the form of grants and soft loans-- that has been injected into Africa has not been negligible.  Whether it has been used effectively or not is, of course, another matter.  But this is a double-edged sword. There are indeed serious errors that must be remedied on the part of donors which I shall try to briefly deal with in the section on international cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iv) The fourth and last factor is a broader regional and international approach to development. This involves increased regional cooperation to widen economic complimentarity, better exploitation of comparative advantage, and a bigger market for economies of scale as well as wide scope for joint ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;International Cooperation&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the risk of over repetition, I wish to emphasize that international cooperation is indispensable in an interdependent world which is getting smaller every day under the pervasive power of communications. The weak and powerful, the small and the big, the poor and the rich have to interact, willy nilly, as none of them can go it alone. The main issues in the post Cold War period and the 21st century-- environment, population growth, international terrorism, etc.-- are in fact global in nature and will require increased international consensus and cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of relevance and controversy will thus be the nature of this cooperation, particularly as it relates to the weak and small.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For us, symmetry should be the linchpin of this relationship.  International cooperation will be essential and catalytic to our development in forms of the transfer of technology: external finance in the form of aid, trade and investment; technical assistance for capacity building; as well as meaningful cooperation to ward off threats to peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this will only be true if international cooperation is perceived as and upgraded to evolve into true partnership. Donor-recipient relationships based on prescription and dictation of unsuitable antidotes will not do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our independence of decision should not be encroached by conditionalities of aid. Recipient countries are better place to determine and identify the policies, priorities and objectives they wish to pursue.  Moreover, this is a fundamental question of dignity which cannot be compromised by temporary necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New concepts in the donors lexicon such as programme ownership and national execution need to be expanded and familiarized to help cement this desired symmetry. We must be cautious about programmes of technical assistance and donor intervention that perpetuate themselves replacing the original purpose of grooming local experts, and activities that increasingly tend to substitute local actors and governments. On the other hand, donors should insist on mechanisms of transparency and rigorous monitoring of end use of funds to ensure that they are not abused or pocketed by unscrupulous bureaucrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A word regarding the international organizations might also be in place here. There is a growing consensus among Third World countries that representation in the major international-- bodies the Security Council, the Bretton Woods institutions, etc.-- needs radical reviewing in order to reflect a more democratic presence of the constituencies. I believe that this issue will have to be addressed in greater detail in the years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Marginalization of Africa&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is marginalized as manifested by its failure to close the gap-- which is actually widening--with the developed and newly industrializing countries: by its huge indebtedness, by its failure to attract foreign investment; by the poor status and impoverishment of its inhabitants; and by other conventional economic indicators. Apart from unfair terms of trade and related international economic interactions which have worded to the disadvantage of Africa, the main reasons for its miserable performance in the post-colonial era are those which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech: namely, perennial conflicts and civil strife, bad governance, corruption and nepotism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, although the colonial legacy has contributed to arrest Africa's expected progress, it has not been the major cause. On the other hand, we cannot downplay the continued and subtle manipulation of Africa's politics and economy by external actors who do not always have Africa's welfare as their priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet Africa has the inner potential to break from this cycle of despair and marginalization. It has abundant natural resources, a population of around 600 million, vibrant economies which can spring to life if correct policies are embarked on even at this late hour, and a sizable educated class. This decisive leap can be made if the anomalies cited earlier are corrected and Africans take their future into their own hands. Above all, the resigned attitude, the lack of confidence perhaps inculcated by decades of dehumanizing experience must be shattered and Africa encouraged to look inwards with a sense of purpose and pride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution to Africa's myriad problems, the answer to its marginalization will thus depend on Africans themselves. Naturally, support from the international community will be vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honorable Delegates</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For us, the precepts that I have described with some detail do not constitute mere platitudes or long-term ideals. The political will and requisite commitment to translate them into concrete tangible programs must indeed be in place in order to engender hope, confidence and collective action by all those concerned. This is, in fact, the only yardstick for measuring the seriousness and validity of these values and ideals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, Eritrea did not opt for a unilateral declaration of independence when it won the war in 1991 after thirty years of bitter armed struggle that exacted heavy sacrifices. Committed as it was to secure, lasting regional and internal peace, it chose instead to assert its independence through international legality and the consultation of its population. Thus, it conducted an internationally supervised referendum, keeping on hold its hard-won sovereignty for an interim period of two years.  It declared formal independence only when the Eritrean people gave their verdict with a resounding yes vote of 99.9%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea has further managed to cultivate and forge an exemplary relationship of solid cooperation with Ethiopia, its arch-enemy for the last half century. The warm ties of friendship that characterize the fledgling cooperation between both countries, unblighted by feelings of vindictiveness and bitterness, must offer reassuring relief for many of us, especially when we see the havoc wrought and the cycles of violence engendered by these attitudes in many problem areas-- Somalia, Rwanda, Liberia, etc.-- in our continent and elsewhere in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean government has not, moreover, been complacent in sparing efforts to consolidate the prevailing peace and stability. To ensure the rule of law and to build as well as strengthen the institutions of democracy, it is vigorously pursuing a measured and prudent democratic path. It has thus formed a Commission to draft a constitution that will be ratified through a constituent assembly within the coming two years. This will pave the way for democratic elections and the formation of a constitutional government with the interim period of four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here again, the government has been careful to ensure and encourage grassroots participation and involvement in the constitution drafting process. Gender issues, cultural diversity and multiplicity, and traditional values of the society were taken into account when the commission was formed.  The fifty member Commission brings together legal experts, elders and other eminent personalities from a cross-section of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As mentioned before, peace and security will be sustainable only when they are accompanied by sound economic policies that lead towards a tangible progress. Aware of this truth, the government has done its homeward in the past three years and has now formulated a clear macro-policy and sectoral strategies of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The efforts that the government has exerted with its partners to promote regional peace and security are perhaps too well-known to merit repetition here. Eritrea has, moreover, been able to foster bilateral relationships as a sovereign state within the wider community of nations.  These ties are proving useful in promoting the collective interests and aspirations of our region in its interactions with the wider world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, I wish to underline that although we have no illusions on the complexity and intensity of the burdens we are shouldering to promote regional peace and security and the well-being of our people, we are confident that we shall be able to realize these aims through patience, hard word and the indispensable assistance of friends and partners who share with us these common ideals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Daily Observer - (Editorial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">December 12, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By Sir Alieu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, the continent that abounds in rich natural resources, continues to amaze the world with its incapacity to provide for itself. We Africans seem to have lost our way and we are not even sure whether to produce for ourselves or continue to rely heavily on western foreign aid for our development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the modern panoply of official aid institutions grew up after the Second World War, the intention was not to relieve poverty as such but to promote economic growth in poor countries. Aid was seen as a transitional device to help countries reach a point from which their economies would take off of their own accord. Its use was to remove shortages of capital and foreign exchange, boosting investment to a point at which growth could become self sustaining.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1960, about $1.4 trillion has been transferred in aid from rich countries to poor ones. Yet little is known about what the process has achieved. Has it relieved poverty? Has it stimulated growth in the recipient countries including The Gambia? Has it helped the donor countries to achieve their official goals by using aid to buy third world adherence to their pet ideas? &quot;The Gambian Case&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such questions become more pertinent as we start to stand on our own feet in light of the decision to spend aid from our traditional aid providers. Proponents of aid will argue that the abrupt cessation of aid to The Gambia will cause severe economic dislocation and diminish the supply of much needed foreign capital and investments, which will adversely affect the standard of living of the majority in our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics, on the other hand, argue that with dwindling aid budgets around the world and the ominous reluctance of taxpayers in rich countries, who view aid as an unnecessary evil and want their money to be spent on the growing number of poor and homeless people in their backyards, ponder on the effectiveness of aid to alleviate poverty whether directly or indirectly, and believe that recipient countries like The Gambia, failed to make the most out of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The belief that aid is a critical factor in our country's development and that some have even rated it above foreign trade is a popular fallacy that requires careful analysis. Killing the goose that lays the golden egg is one way of depriving us the continuous supply of the egg. The other way is for the goose of its own volition, to cease producing the golden egg. This is an unfortunate characteristic of aid. Unlike other forms of foreign finance, aid does not carry with it the notion of &quot;shared commitment&quot;, an important factor if aid is to be referred to as &quot;an engine of growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid in the 1980s was frequently used as a prod to encourage African countries to begin &quot;structural adjustment&quot; programmes in support of the World Bank's recommendations, and since that time many donors have come to believe that the quality of a country's economic management will do most to determine whether aid will do some good. This is inconsistent with the original goals of giving out aid to alleviate poverty and foster economic growth in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Uneven Growth&quot;Some third-world countries have enjoyed fast economic growth with relatively little aid per head. In particular, China and Vietnam had little or no aid at a time when donors were pouring money into Africa with strings of SAP conditions. If some countries can achieve economic growth with little aid, while other countries can get a great deal of aid do not grow at all, what is aid good for?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a recent World Bank report, the richest 40 of the developing countries get about twice as much as the poorest as the poorest 40 percent, and that 50 percent of the available aid for third world counties goes to big military spenders like Egypt and Israel instead of the less belligerent countries who need it most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study of America's aid programme conducted by the Overseas Development Council (ODC) based in Washington, D.C., found that more than $250 per person went to relatively big-income countries like Egypt and El Salvador, but less than $1 per person to very low-income countries such as The Gambia and Bangladesh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report further disclosed that roughly 25 per cent of the United States $21 billion foreign-aid budget takes the form of military assistance, and roughly a quarter of the total budget goes to Israel and Egypt alone.  &quot;The United States has spent more money on advancing political and military goals in the third world than on development says John Sewell of the ODC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidently, this statement partly conflicts with some of the reasons given for the cessation of crucial US development assistance to the people of The Gambia. If neighbouring countries in the region continue to receive US military assistance in the form of &quot;national security&quot;, why is it that the development assistance meant to benefit the majority of the Gambian people is to cease for the simple reason that the law in the US with regards to military regimes will be violated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Security&quot; The pursuit of national security is also now being used as an argument for giving more weight to all sorts of other goals in the drawing-up of aid budgets in the rich countries. Not surprisingly the motives in giving out aid to poor countries often override the goal of poverty relief, where on earth do we want peace to prevail?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within poor countries aid is rarely concentrated on the services that benefit the poorest, at a time when aid budgets around the world are ceasing to frow at all and most countries are attaching strings of conditions to their deveilopment assistance. Hapan's aid goes mainly to countries that are most likely to become its future customers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All DAC (OECD's Development Assistance Committee) countries tie soemaid to the purchase of thier own gods and services. Some kinds of ODA are given in the sure knowledge that the money will be spent mainly in the donor country, but without explicitly tying the kind of aid given.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is estimated that about 90 per cent of the ODA which goes each year to buy advice, training and project design, is spent on foreign consultants.  Half of all technical assistance goes to Africa which, observes an UNDP expert, &quot;has received more bad advice per capital than any other continent&quot;.  Most thoughtful people in the aid business regard technical assistnce as one of the lest effective ways to foster develoment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, there have been significant improvements in our standard of living that can be related to the foreign we received. Nobody will deny the importance of aid, but the real issue now is that a lot of real economists have picked holes int he original idea that aid will boost investment; why should it, some ask, when governments may simply use income from aid as an excuse to spend tax revenues in other, less productive ways?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others worry about the tendency of aid to compensate for failure rather than to reward success. Bilateral donors have increasingly found that much of the aid they give to some countries goes towards paying back borrowed money from international financial institutions that were unwisely spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the various transfers that count as &quot;aid&quot; the many conditions that donors attach, the differing importance of aid to different countries and the complexity of economic growht, there are simply too many variables to say that aid is useful and that we cannot do without it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign trade, especially the re-export trade, has been the mainstay of our economy that overly relies on aid for economic growht will surely fail one day. We should be in total control of the variables that will help our economy grow. Aid should be seen as something beyond our control and not a factor of production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old jibe about aid-poor people in rich countries helping rich people in poor countries to grow- has plenty of truth in it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by M. Garlinda Burton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As families, friends, professors and other supporters cheered, the 27 young men and women of Africa University's first graduating class also heard a charge to the weighty task of &quot;shining like stars&quot; as leaders of a &quot;new Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's first private university, founded by the United Methodist Church, marked its first graduation exercises Dec. 17 with dancing, singing, prayers, and tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excitement ran high among the 19 agriculture students and eight theological students who now return to communities around Africa to use their skills for the betterment of the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attending the exercises were more than 900 persons, including retired United Methodist Bishop Leotine T.C. Kelly of San Mateo, Calif., who led the opening procession, and United Methodist Bishops Emilio deCarvalho of Angola and Arthur Kulah of Liberia, who received honorary degrees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two African bishops issued the first challenge in 1980 that the United Methodist Church open a university in Africa. Both the trustees of the school, deCarvalho is also chancellor (chairman of the board).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotions of the graduates ranged from elation to reluctance to say goodbye to the close-knit university community. Tsitsi Moyo, a mother of four from Zimbabwe who received a bachelor of divinity degree, admitted her pride and joy were mixed with sorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know I'm ready to go, but it is hard to leave,&quot; said Moyo, now an ordained United Methodist minister who will work as co-pastor with he husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commencement speaker was the Rev. Randolph Nugent, mission executive for the 9 million-member, global United Methodist Church. Nugent compared the nurture and &quot;birthing&quot; of Africa University's graduates to the birth of Christ, expressing hope that the young leaders will bring a &quot;great light&quot; to an often troubled continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vice Chancellor John Kurewa lauded the graduates as brave visionaries, who came to the university when it was little more than renovated farm houses and a dream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thanks to the faith and outstanding performance by students and supporters, the graduates' continued high performance, the United Methodist Church, and private donors, Kurewa said, Africa University's influence on the continent will be far-reaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa University opened in March 1992 with 40 students in two colleges--theology and agriculture, and natural resources. More than 6,000 people from around the world attended the formal opening of the university held in April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With continuing support of the denomination the school has grown to 85 students, and a school management and administration (business) will open in March 1995 . Future plans call for schools of education, medicine, science and social sciences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Mark Gevisser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo is a poet and writer and the new minister of housing, succeeding the late Joe Slovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Comrade Wife,&quot; wrote ANC poet and diplomat Zinjiva Nkondo to his wife, Sankie, during their years of separation in exile, &quot;I know you are not afraid/ of spears/ your thighs and breasts of humanhood/ have outgrown these pests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are divorced now, and he lives in Zambia. But they were, in the 1980s, one of the ANC's preWhile working in Lusaka, she wrote a story under her nom de guerre, Rebecca Matlou, entitled One Never Knows, eminent literary couples: both had volumes of poetry published by the Congress of South African Writers in 1990. which won special mention in a contentinental women's writing competition and was published in a Swedish anthology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like her protagonist in this story, who becomes unwittingly involved in the ANC underground in the 1970s, Mthembi- Nkondo gives the impression of being rock-solid, a pillar of the struggle, &quot;not afraid of spears&quot;. But the story, as its title suggests, is about the impossibility of understanding the present and determining the future. This, up against the formidable revolutionary rationalism of the ANC. There's a subtext to Mthembiaround her, the reader understands her alienation and insecurity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkondo's genial strength, one which is found in her fiction: while her female hero radiates silent courage to those</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview this week, she returned repeatedly to the difficulties of exile and separation; and to the refuge that the movement provided. There is something quite incongruous about her willingness to spool randomly through her consciousness: &quot;When I began to receive multiparty South African delegations in Bonn (where she was ANC chief representative until late 1993), I began to understand that it was possible to return home, really to return home. And my mind wandered back to my childhood, to my friends and school and family, and I began to imagine how we all would function as a liberated people.&quot; This is a poet's way of being, one thinks.  Not a politician's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet she likes to portray herself as tough: &quot;You must remember,&quot; she twinkles, &quot;that I come from Soweto. The ghetto, the jungle. You learn to survive there. If you allow yourself to be bullied, you'll spend the rest of your days paying off protection fees. And so you toughen up; you become a product of your environment.&quot; One of the things she learnt in other parts of Africa, she says, &quot;is that you don't have to fight. You can disagree with someone, and argue for hours, like the Nigerians do. You don't have to pull a knife out.&quot;Poet-intellectual she might be. But she must have the instincts of a politician to have become one of the very few women to have made it to the upper echelons of ANC power. Early on in her exile, as a journalist on Radio Freedom, she came to the attention of Thabo Mbeki, then head of ANC information. She later worked under him in the international affairs department -- first in Lagos and then in Bonn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several sources in the ANC believe her appointment to be a direct result of her relationship with Mbeki: after her return to South Africa in 1993, she ran the department of international affairs for him. Others counter, however, that Mbeki frequently overlooked her -- placing Aziz Pahad above her in the transitional executive committee's foreign affairs subcommittee, for example. And that she caught Nelson Mandela's eye in Bonn where she took over a particularly difficult and troublesome terrain -- relations between the ANC and the German government were not good -- and transformed it into one of the more effective missions of the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, Mandela -- along with Mbeki and Jacob Zuma -- is believed to have supported her in the election for deputy secretary general at last month's ANC congress, a battle she lost decisively to the far higher profile --and more leftwing -- Cheryl Carolus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet insiders suggest that her appointment was a combination of two key factors: Mandela's desire to keep the housing ministry powered by Joe Slovo's legacy -- which would require a lower-profile minister both efficient and humble -- and his wish to develop new, and particularly female, political leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel terribly uncomfortable here,&quot; she says, on her second day in an office whose generic Pretoria drabness allows for no remembrance of its former occupant. &quot;I kept on moving about this afternoon, looking for a different chair. I didn't want to sit where Comrade Joe sat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is of the 1976 generation -- her classmates at Turfloop included Cyril Ramaphosa and Matthews Phosa, and she was to begin teaching in Soweto in the very year of the uprising. For her, Slovo was of the generation that &quot;took responsibility for bringing us up, both politically and literally, for we were little more than children when we left the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be &quot;dishonest&quot;, she says, &quot;to attempt to imitate him&quot;. But running the ministry will be about &quot;upholding his principles and making sure that what he has created is not destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something radically new she will bring to the housing sector: the sheer fact that she is a woman. She has a characteristically lyrical response to the suggestion that she has moved from the female realm of welfare to the male realm of housing: &quot;It might be macho to see people building houses, putting brick on top of brick. But there's another way of looking at it. Let's look at households rather than empty houses. More than two thirds of all South African households are headed by women and the strength and the power of those households are dependent on women. The household is central to the sanity and harmony of society, and there's a woman at the centre of that household.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mthembi-Nkondo did feel particularly judged as a woman in her last post, as deputy minister of welfare: &quot;If you're a woman, you're expected to deliver, sometimes unfairly, in a very short space of time.&quot; Her record as deputy minister of welfare was not wildly impressive: according to those in the welfare sector, very little happened at the ministry, but they blame this on the fact that the minister, Abe Williams, is a National Party appointment, who had little interest in transforming the department and who allowed his deputy very little room to maneuver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the fact that she was trained as a diplomat, she feels very comfortable in the field of service provision; welfare or housing. She articulates a dedication that is utterly credible. Listen, for example, to a story she relates, off the cuff:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I first started coming back to South Africa, whenever I'd go home to Meadowlands, I'd ask someone to come with me, because I couldn't take the face of suffering that would confront me. There were twins across the road from us, who were born when I was about 12, and I used to look after them, I brought them up. Now, when I see them, I look at faces that look older than me, because of poverty, because of drink. When I first went home, I tried to find out what had happened to Ma Julia, to Ntati Simon, to Cookies. And the tape would unwind: he was stabbed when crossing from Dube station, she got shot outside the hostel, he's a hobo now. I might be a cabinet minister now, but because the rest of them in Meadowlands didn't have my opportunities, my achievement belongs to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her poetry, like her fiction, deals with the themes of commitment and trust. While she lionises the heroes of the struggle --from Ruth First, an early mentor, to Oliver Tambo-- she agonises over the work expected of her as a &quot;soldier-poet&quot;: On the one hand, &quot;I do not have the leisure/to wander along aimless paths/ to wallow in literary art creations&quot;; on the other, &quot;I cannot shelve my creative instincts/until peace time ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her anthology, Flames of Fury, has both the compelling rhythms and the overwrought imagery of South African struggle poetry, influenced in equal measure by the black consciousness movement of the 1970s and the Lusophone poet- revolutionaries; lines like &quot;Flames fume fury and vengeance/ the falcon souls burn in haste&quot; and &quot;I know who I am/ I die in detention everyday/.../ I am my people/ my country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is evidence in her verse of serious talent: she implores a mother, for example, to &quot;show scorn ... with the swoop of your backside&quot;.  Perhaps, in another place and another time, Mthembi-Nkondo might have gone down in history as a competent and respected poet; a minor literary celebrity on the world beat. But she is, so quintessentially, a product of this place and this time: out of the country in 1977; into power in 1994. She might yet go down in history as a major political figure: the woman who filled Joe Slovo's shoes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 27, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Gaye Davis in Parliament</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The huge task of writing the country's new constitution began in earnest this week as political parties squared up against each other in sometimes acrimonious debate, spelling out their vision for the document which will become the supreme law of the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy President Thabo Mbeki rejected the notion of continued power-sharing entrenched in the constitution, saying the party which won the majority of votes in 1999 should form the government. Support for the ANC's position that coalitions be voluntary came from the Pan Africanist Congress' Richard Sizani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party member Andre Fourie accused Mbeki of &quot;closing the door on negotiations&quot;. In addition to entrenched power-sharing, the NP wants enshrined the principles of subsidiarity -- power devolving to the lowest level of government capable of carrying it out -- and asymmetry, where not every province gets the same powers and functions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC wants regional and local powers subjected to what Mbeki described as &quot;the need for national uniformity&quot;. While traditional leadership would be recognised and protected, in a democracy their demands could not take precedence. He warned against &quot;the Balkanisation and fragmentation of the country when we discuss the devolution of powers to lower levels of government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer said continued multiparty participation at all levels and in all structures of government would prevent any abuse of power and serve the best interests of the nation as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing the NP of hypocrisy, the PAC's Patricia de Lille said: &quot;They are the very same people who used a unitary state very effectively to oppress us all these years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC wants proportional representation maintained, but has left the door open for constituencies to help close the gap between people and elected representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Freedom Front's Corne Mulder argued for Afrikaner self-determination within an area or areas where they formed the majority -- what FF leader General Constand Viljoen has called &quot;an engine room&quot; of Afrikaner culture with its own radio stations, schools and universities and where Afrikaans is the official language. Members of &quot;other nations&quot; could also live there if they chose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attempt by the IFP to insist that international mediation settle its regional demands -- promised to it in terms of a pre-election agreement -- and take place as part of the constitution-making process was given short shrift by the ANC's Johnny de Lange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A committee comprising Meyer, his deputy and senior ANC negotiator, Valli Moosa, and Correctional Services Minister Sipho Mzimela has been appointed to negotiate with the IFP. De Lange said on reaching agreement they would report back to parliament, but &quot;under no circumstances&quot; would this process be allowed to hold up parliament or the constitutional assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Christian Democratic Party leader the Reverend Kenneth Meshoe said the constitutional principle forbidding discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation should be scrapped as it promoted homosexuality and was against family values, African culture and biblical teachings. &quot;To build a family, Adam needed Eve, not Steve,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the parties skirmished, a huge campaign to involve the public in the process geared up. Constitutional assembly chairman Cyril Ramaphosa told the plenary session that tentative agreement had been reached with banks on printing information on bank-machine slips and supermarkets had agreed to do the same on till slips. Weekends will see constitutional assembly members addressing forums in townships, villages, informal settlements and farms.  Internet surfers will also be able to dip into the constitutional debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six 30-member theme committees started work this week and will hear submissions on the character of the democratic state, the structure of government, the relationship between levels of government, fundamental rights, the judiciary and specialised structures of government. Members were this week already doubting that they would meet their deadlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new constitution has to be written by May 1996. Any extension would need all seven parties in the constitutional assembly agreeing to amend the interim constitution, which lays down two years for creating a new one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 27, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former superspy Craig Williamson -- the one former agent that knows more than most about the &quot;dirty tricks&quot; of his apartheid bosses -- this week was at loggerheads with Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha and other National Party politicians over their handling of the police indemnities saga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williams warned NP politicians &quot;not to think we have forgotten who gave us the orders&quot;. It drew a sharp response from Botha, who said Williamson was a &quot;clown you have to be careful of&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former spy accused NP politicians, and in particular Botha, of betraying the security forces &quot;which kept the Nats in power for so long&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson said he was ready to take his own &quot;sins&quot; to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He said he had rebuffed an approach by a police brigadier to join the 3500 policemen who applied for indemnity before April's elections as &quot;I thought it would do more harm than good&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said both sides to the conflict had committed crimes but charged that the difference, as illustrated by the NP's &quot;incompetent&quot; handling of the indemnities issue, was that the ANC &quot;stood by its people&quot; while NP politicians did not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson said Botha's statement before last week's cabinet meeting that no amnesty had been granted to the 3500 had left him confused. &quot;If anybody who is in cabinet now knew what was happening then (in the apartheid years), it is Pik.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha said his statement had been misinterpreted; that he had never said the amnesties were invalid -- only that the courts would have to decide, which was the accepted legal &quot;consensus&quot; anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to Williamson's charge that he had known of &quot;dirty tricks&quot;, Botha shot back: &quot;He is talking nonsense.&quot; He said he had been a member of the State Security Council -- the body which co-ordinated the apartheid government's response to the &quot;total onslaught&quot; -- but he had &quot;tried to stop wrong things from happening so that we would not get further sanctions against us&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if that did not imply he knew about &quot;dirty tricks&quot;, Botha said: &quot;I did not know of 'dirty tricks'. I knew what was on the agenda of the State Security Council, but I never served on the sub-committees which had to put broad directives into action ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sue de Villiers, publicity officer for Justice Minister Dullah Omar, said this week that high-ranking delegations from the army and police had met Amnesty Office officials before the April elections to discuss whether their applications would be successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amnesty Office officials told them their formula, which asked for indemnity for &quot;all actions&quot; rather than specifying the individual applicant's offence, would not lead to automatic indemnity. De Villiers said the Defence Force delegation then announced it would not submit indemnity applications en masse.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 27, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa will not be part of the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Angola because Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos won't play host to countries previously involved in his country's war. Zimbabwe Defence Minister Moven Mahachi this week attacked South Africa for its apparent failure to respond to requests for troops to participate in an envisaged 7 500-strong UN force to monitor Angola's tenuous peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a regional peacekeeping seminar in Harare, attended by army officers of 19 African states including South Africa, Mahachi said that if South Africa failed to respond to UN requests for troops, it would cast &quot;serious doubt on its commitment to peace&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe -- whose President Robert Mugabe is reportedly keen to regain the initiative as top regional peacemaker from President Nelson Mandela -- has already promised a battalion of troops to join the UN Angola Verification Mission (Unavem) force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has indeed been churlish, to an extent, in responding to the UN request for assistance, made by the world body when Dos Santos' Frelimo government and Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebels agreed to a ceasefire in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African position, decided by the cabinet in early December, boiled down to an agreement to be part of Unavem, but without troops in a combat role. South Africa would provide only logistic support, such as air transport and engineers, the cabinet decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explained Defence Ministry publicity officer Major Muff Andersson: &quot;It would have led to tensions in the new integrated force ... People in the South African National Defence Force used to be on different sides in Angola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even the engineers and the aviators, it seems, will now have to stay at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andersson said: &quot;The cabinet accepted that we cannot turn our backs on Angola. But when we got as far as drawing up plans on when we could send people and where, that's when we heard we would be unwelcome.&quot; Despite Zimbabwe's criticism, South Africa could do nothing but wait, she said. &quot;The guests want us to go but the hosts are ambivalent. If Angola decides we are an important country to have there, we will be there. But for now, we will just stand and wait politely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Department of Foreign Affairs official this week said Dos Santos' stance, contained in a letter dated December 5 to UN secretary general Boutros Boutros-Gali, came to South Africa's attention only about a week later, after the cabinet had approved the limited involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said he interpreted the letter -- which stated that countries which previously were &quot;directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in Angola&quot; would not be welcome as part of the Unavem force -- as meaning that a country such as Zaire, whose President Mobutu Sese Seko has backed Unita, would also not be welcome. Other countries affected by Dos Santos' exclusion may be the United States, Cuba and Russia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Search for Common Ground</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by John Marks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summary--Sometimes a situation -- such as the prospect of genocide -- is so compelling that it demands action. In our view, this is the case in Burundi, where thousands of people have been massacred but where the killing has not reached the scale of neighboring Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the terms of this program, Search for Common Ground (SCG) will work under the direction of the Bujumbura Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General (UNSRSG) and in collaboration with the Council on Foreign Relations, the African American Institute, and Refugees International to carry out an integrated, multi-faceted initiative to try to prevent ethnic warfare from escalating in Burundi and to promote the process of reconciliation. The overall aim will be to work with Burundian partners in establishing a culture of negotiation and peaceful conflict resolution in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basic premise of the proposal is that: If Burundi cannot develop ways to resolve conflict without violence, democracy cannot possibly take hold.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This initiative, which is similar conceptually to a comprehensive prevention project which Search for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Common Ground is currently carrying out in Macedonia, will include the following package of preventive measures: 1. Radio Reconciliation; 2.  Negotiation training for high level political leaders; 3. Conflict resolution training for parliamentary leaders; 4. Conflict resolution training for the clergy; 5. Joint Hutu-Tutsi Leadership Trips to South Africa; 6. Conflict Resolution in the Schools; 7. Support for University Conflict Resolution Center; 8. Support for a Buyoya Foundation conference on reconciliation ; 9.  Burundi Policy Forum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background--Burundi is a country which has a long history of ethnic enmity and warfare between Hutus (about 85% of the population) and the long dominant Tutsis (roughly 15%). The cycle of violence persists, and numerous members of both ethnic groups have considerable blood on their hands. In the last year, tens of thousands of Burundians are estimated to have been slaughtered by members of the other ethnic group. However, despite the fact that the killing continues, the country has managed to avoid the outright holocaust that has taken place in neighboring Rwanda, a country with similar ethnic make-up, history, and geography.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November a delegation co-sponsored by Refugees International (RI) and Search for Common Ground (SCG) visited Burundi to explore opportunities for conflict resolution and reconciliation. RI initiated the trip in order to catalyze concrete steps to help prevent future ethnic warfare -- in effect, a preventive campaign similar to SCG's current initiative in Macedonia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delegation members included RI President Lionel Rosenblatt, RI European representative Yvette Pierpaoli, Conflict Resolution Consultant Susan Collin Marks, a veteran of the South African peace process and presently a Fellow at the US Institute of Peace, and SCG President John Marks. Superb support for the trip was provided by the Bujumbura Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation met with a former President, a former Prime Minister, the widow of an assassinated President, four Cabinet ministers, Parliamentary leaders, heads of Burundian and expatriate NGOs, the US Ambassador and key members of the embassy staff, USAID, USIA, OAU, National Democratic Institute (NDI) personnel, the Papal Nuncio, clergy, academics, and the two principal representatives of the UN Secretary General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation listened carefully to suggestions from Burundians and expatriates on how to advance the prospects for reconciliation and peaceful resolution of conflict and looked at each suggestion in view of experience gained in other countries. The idea was to assess which initiatives were feasible and for SCG to determine which were within its capacity to implement. The delegation made every effort to coordinate its inquiry with other NGOs, governments, and international organizations so as to avoid duplication of existing efforts. Indeed, it found that there were already in place a series of reconciliation programs with the support of the UN Secretary-General's Office, UNDP, UNESCO, UNHCR, USAID, USIA, and NDI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, a series of requests for assistance were made by Burundian and expatriate groups in areas that SCG felt it could make a unique contribution. This will require sending at least one representative to Bujumbura and bringing in Francophone conflict resolution trainers and other relevant specialists as appropriate. The office of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative has tentatively agreed to work in collaboration with the SCG project. In addition, the Center for Preventive Diplomacy of the Council on Foreign Relations and the African American Institutes will be partners in the work. Together, there will be developed a program for policy advocacy, which will include a Burundi Policy Forum which will meet monthly in Washington for NGO representatives, government officials, and international organization officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SCG has decided to move forward with full awareness of the tremendous complexity involved in carrying out conflict resolution and reconciliation work in Burundi. As a high international official said, &quot;Everyone is afraid&quot; - of domination and extermination. &quot;I've never been in a place where fear is so rampant,&quot; added a top US official, &quot;where people tend to blame others, and where no one takes personal responsibility.&quot; Said a Western aid worker, &quot;There has been so much pain and suffering, they just don't deal with it.  People keep it all inside and suppressed.&quot; He noted that the &quot;conflict resolution process is foreign.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Hutu human rights activist said that he felt the violence was abating, but &quot;first we need justice.&quot; He stressed that individuals cannot mete out justice; &quot;otherwise it's the law of the jungle.&quot; He noted that the legal structure was controlled by Tutsis and that there was no system for punishing the military (95% Tutsi). In the same vein, a Tutsi Cabinet Minister talked of how Hutus had in the last months murdered several close family members, and he also called for justice. It was not difficult to see how one side's justice could be the other's retribution and how there is tension between justice and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what needed to be done to promote reconciliation, an international official said, in all seriousness, that Burundi needed &quot;continuous brainwashing over three years through communications and media.&quot; In answer to the same question, a Burundian professor called for a strategy that convened Tutsis and Hutus for meetings and &quot;especially doing things together.&quot; He advocated starting slowly, concentrating on the education system, and encouraging self-reliance and self-sufficiency. A Burundian woman replied that what was needed was for Burundians to learn to accept each other with all their differences. The way to do this, she said, is to push people to meet. She and several other people stressed working particularly with women because they are &quot;sick of the fighting,&quot; they are much less likely to have participated in the fighting, and they have much less resistance to reconciliation than men. The widow of an assassinated president said that at a certain point people must say this is enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former Prime Minister called for &quot;changing the mentality&quot; of Burundi's military so that &quot;it is seen by the population that they play a necessary role.&quot; To help do this, she called for bringing in foreign military to share their experiences with the Burundian military. A Parliamentarian noted that &quot;even people of good faith do not have the tools to negotiate.&quot; He noted that a role of foreigners could be &quot;to help us to meet each other.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation left Burundi with the belief that while activities aimed at promoting conflict resolution and reconciliation are important and necessary, they are only one component in a larger mosaic of measures that need to be taken to assure peace in Burundi. Burundians called for economic development, implementation of the rule of law to create a working justice system, military reform, and increased international and domestic support for the fledgling government coalition. Project Objectives--to reduce the level of ethnic tensions in Burundi and thereby reduce the likelihood of violent conflict; to build a culture of negotiation and peaceful conflict resolution in Burundi; to create and provide support to mechanisms and institutions that contribute to reconciliation and the building of democracy in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project Activities--1. Radio Reconciliation -- Burundi National Radio, the Minister of Communications, the UN office, and USIA offered to cooperate in producing a regular radio program -- probably an hour per day -- dedicated to promoting peace and reconciliation. The broadcasts will aim to counter &quot;hate radios&quot; and will be structured along the lines of South Africa's Peace Radio 2000, which SCG co-produced and which promoted values of peace, reconciliation, and an end to violence. Burundi radio will provide facilities, personnel, and broadcast time. USIS has expressed interest in making available technical assistance and programming and in organizing seminars to train rural Burundians to prepare taped reports on events in the countryside. SCG will furnish an American co-producer and experience in program content and project management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Negotiation training for high level political leaders. The Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General asked SCG to design and lead a three- day training program in negotiation skills for 30 Burundian political and civic leaders selected from the major political and ethnic groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Conflict Resolution Training for Parliamentary leaders. Leaders of the two parliamentary parties, the predominantly Tutsi UPRONA and the Hutu FRODEBU, in separate meetings, asked for training in conflict resolution skills. Both agreed that they will share in joint training programs with the other. Indeed, one parliamentarian noted that the skill-building sessions will provide a &quot;pretext&quot; for coming together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Conflict Resolution Training for Clergy. The International Bible Society requested mediation training for Protestant, Catholic, and Evangelical clergy. The purpose will be to provide these natural peace-makers with hands-on, conflict resolution skills that could be applied at the grassroots, parish level. Clergy will also be trained as trainers, so that they could further extend the outreach of the program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Joint Hutu-Tutsi Leadership Trips to South Africa. The parliamentary leaders expressed interest in being able to travel to South Africa in a delegation with their opposite numbers in order to explore the South African success in transcending racial and ethnic divisions. The Office of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General expressed interest in supporting this program and suggested that it also include military leaders. (Note: Virtually every Burundian with whom the delegation spoke expressed great interest in the South African model and provided support for the working assumption that South Africa's experience in conflict resolution and reconciliation is probably the one most applicable to Burundi.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Conflict Resolution in the School. A Burundian educator requested through USIS support for curriculum development and training that will make possible the introduction of conflict resolution and peace education in Burundian schools. The UN would be interested in providing and distributing materials in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Support for a University Conflict Resolution Center. A professor at Burundi University requested support for the development of a Center for Conflict Resolution which would be under joint Hutu-Tutsi leadership. Such a center would provide an academic base for training and research in conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Support for a Buyoya Foundation Conference on Reconciliation.  Former President Pierre Buyoya and NDI requested assistance in designing and facilitating a conference early in 1995 entitled &quot;The Process of Reconciliation.&quot; SCG will also assist in identifying appropriate southern African participants who will be asked to communicate their experiences in conciliation and nation-building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Burundi Policy Forum. Under the direction of Barnett Rubin, Director of the Council on Foreign Relations' Center for Preventive Diplomacy, the Burundi Policy Forum will be convened once a month in Washington. Present will be representatives of government agencies, international organizations, and NGOs working on Burundi. The purpose will be to exchange information, promote cooperation, coordinate programs, and catalyze policy initiatives which might contribute to conflict resolution and reconciliation in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evaluation Plan--The project's impact on Burundi will be felt through increased dialogue and cooperation between the country's ethnic communities and gradual resolution of the controversies that divide them. SCG staff and partner organizations will regularly confer with their local partners to gauge the efficacy of our methods and approaches. Specific means of evaluation will include: participants in all workshops and training sessions will be requested to complete a questionnaire designed to assess the relevance of the materials presented and the effectiveness of the presentation. The responses will be analyzed and used to improve future programs. Follow- up interviews of selected workshop participants will be conducted to identify specific examples in which the skills learned were successfully applied to conflict situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organizational Background--Search for Common Ground is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to finding workable solutions to divisive national and international problems. Established in 1982, SCG applies the most advanced techniques of conflict resolution, negotiation, facilitation, and collaborative problemThe Initiative for Peace and Cooperation in the Middle East, initiated in 1991 to encourage comprehensive solving to a broad range of disputes. The organization's current international programs include: approaches to Middle East peace and security; Search for Common Ground in Macedonia, a comprehensive project to help prevent ethnic warfare in Macedonia; Common Ground Productions, SCG's television division, Common Ground Productions, whose series and programs have been broadcast in Russia, South Africa, Macedonia and the United States Search for Common Ground in Russia, which works to adapt Western experiences in conflict management and collaborative problem-solving to Russian society, especially labor- management relations. John Marks, who is President of Search for Common Ground, will provide overall direction to the project.  Bryan Rich, who has worked for Common Ground Productions for the last two years in Russia and Macedonia, will direct SCG operations in Burundi. David Shorr, Washington Director of SCG's Ethnic Conflict Resolution Project, will oversee the project's Washington activities. Susan Collin Marks, currently a Peace Fellow at the US Institute of Peace and a veteran of five years in the South African Peace Process, will serve as an unpaid consultant. Dr. Barnett Rubin, Director of Center for Preventive Diplomacy of the Council on Foreign Relations, will direct his organization's</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">** On the Africa Subcommittee in the last Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Note and Request: A high proportion of the Subcommitee members, in both the Senate and the House, are new to African issues. Many, particularly on the Republican side in the House, are also new to Congress this year. In addition, all members of Congress face serious time pressures to deal with a multitude of issues. How much attention the Subcommittee members devote to Africa, and what views they advocate, will be highly influenced not only by their personal sympathies and ideological perspectives, but also by what they are hearing from relevant constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priority states for building constituencies to educate Africa Subcommitee members and pressure them to take African concerns seriously are thus Kansas (1 Senator, 1 Representative), Wisconsin (1 Senator, 1 Representative), Florida (3 Representatives), New York (2 Representatives) and Maine, Missouri, and California (1 Senator each). Priority Congressional districts are indicated above for each Representative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among actions that would be appropriate for anyone concerned about a U.S. Africa policy responsive to African concerns:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(1) Pass on this update, particularly to Africa- concerned individuals and groups in the relevant states and Congressional districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(2) If you know of individuals or groups, again particularly in the relevant states and Congressional districts, who would be interested in receiving occasional short material on Africa policy and advocacy via email, please send, or ask them to send, their email addresses to woa@igc.apc.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by The Joint Ministry in Africa of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 10, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are sending you this memorandum as concerned citizens and people of faith. The reason for our correspondence is to request that you reconsider the current direction of your administration's foreign policy toward Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago you became the first post Cold War President of the United States. We congratulated you on your election. For millions of people, 1992 represented a time of hope and anticipation, a chance to break out of the shackles of history and a bi-polar world. Your election to the highest and most powerful public office in the United States represented a grand historic moment- one which offered an opportunity to transform US foreign aid programs, human rights policy, the United Nations and international economic priorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in this context, a time of genuine excitement about a new beginning, that the Joint Ministry in Africa sent you a twelve page memorandum on November 20, 1992 (SEE attached addendum).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Joint Ministry in Africa represents the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the United Church of Christ to more than 40 African partner churches, secular bodies of Christian councils. Our two denominations have a combined membership of over 2.5 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992 you &quot;called for a new strategy of American engagement to encourage the spread and consolidation of democracy abroad.&quot; You said that this meant &quot;opposing political oppression across Africa as firmly as we oppose political oppression in Asia and the Middle East. And it means providing support to the victims of war in Liberia and Somalia...In Africa, as elsewhere, the Bush administration has been tepid- when it should have been decisive- in ending aid to dictators, such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.&quot; You also proposed that &quot;Our top priority must be to foster democracy...ensure that the assistance we provide truly benefits Africans...(and) support measures to strengthen UN peacekeeping capabilities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our partner churches and friends in Africa your encouraging words promised a break from a past of &quot;politics as usual&quot; and gave a breath of fresh air to democrats and proponents of justice throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared that the future of Africa lies &quot;not with corrupt dictators like Mobutu, but with courageous democrats&quot;, our hopes, and those of many others, seemed to be moving toward reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our 1992 memorandum urged your new administration to vigorously pursue a democratic and human rights agenda across Africa. Surveying the past two years, we acknowledge that your administration has taken some positive steps. We commend you for; recognizing the elected government of Angola; supporting democratization in Mozambique and South Africa; signing into law the Conflict Resolution Act; providing humanitarian assistance to African nations; sending a high level diplomat to investigate the human rights situation in Sudan; criticizing the Nigerian dictatorship; and holding the first ever Presidential conference on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are many areas where we are frustrated and disappointed.  Your administration seems to be operating without a coherent Africa policy and, perhaps worse, without any convictions of creativity. The U.S. currently seems to meander from one crisis to another; neither learning from the past, nor seeking out new fresh voices that look to the future. With embassies, consulates and AID offices closing in several places, development funds subject to severe cuts, and diminished concerns about human rights, malign neglect seems to be the U.S.'s main policy toward the poorest continent in the world. This policy appears, from our standpoint, to be motivated by a desire to ensure commercial and political interests over human ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zaire, we are distressed that, against the wishes of the democratic Sovereign National Conference, you applauded the appointment of long-time Mobutu ally Kengo wa Dondo as Prime Minister. In Rwanda, although he U.S. has been supplying important humanitarian aid, it was a policy of omission by your administration and others that allowed ethnic tensions to escalate to genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Western Sahara, the democratic aspirations of the Sahrawi people have been ignored. Instead, the U.S. continues to work with the occupying Moroccan state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, it is not only in specific countries that a historic opportunity for reform has been lost. Africa continues to suffer from the effects of structural adjustment programs (SAPs), which, according to UNICEF, OXFAM, UK, the UN Africa Recovery, African churches and grassroots organizations are gutting social services, stagnating economies, and worsening the debt burden of the poor. These programs, designed in part to secure debt payments, are implemented under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank- two institutions that the U.S. has great influence over. SAPs are leading, according to friends, churches and people of faith on the ground, to declining school attendance and health care, malnutrition and unemployment. What we most often hear is that average people have little say in the policies that are so terribly affecting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, many people ask: what validity do elections have if the platforms many governments are elected on are subject to vetoes by the IMF and World Bank?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's debt now stands at almost $300 billion a year, more than its gross domestic product (GDP). Every year, according to the United Nations(UN), billions of dollars flow out of the continent in debt payments.  This money could, if redirected, go to infrastructure, health care, education, eradication of diseases, and jobs. Since the U.S. remains the major actor in the United Nations, the IMF and World Bank, there is much constructive leadership that could still be provided on your part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believed that your election opened the door to this kink of leadership and to the possibility of significant reforms in the U.S.  government, and international bodies, less secretive and dependent on Cold War legacies and ideologies, and more committed to grassroots organizations, participation, and public input. Given your many campaign statements on TV about remaking government and its institutions, we expected that you might advocate for the transformation of the IMF and the World Bank into democratic and accountable institutions. We also hoped that similar reforms might take place in the U.S.'s various foreign aid programs (particularly within the U.S. Agency for International Development)- beset by many of the same problems regarding accountability and lack of participation found in the large international multi-lateral institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead your administration appears to be operating in a vacuum- providing almost no creative, innovative or new ideas on how to deal with Africa's challenges or general foreign policy direction. Consequently, the hopes of millions of people for working with the U.S. and other countries on positive alternatives to debt and structural adjustment have turned to despair. Many Africans say that their world is worse than it was two years ago, on the eve of your inauguration. This situation is partially a result of the U.S.'s abdication from providing practical and moral international leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial hemorrhage that is afflicting Africa leads to unemployment, disaffection and eventually to conflict. It will be much more costly to deal with these problems later (e.g. Rwanda) rather than if the U.S., the UN, and others play a preventive role that deals with the root causes of problems. One of your top aides recently acknowledged this thesis when he said, &quot;Nations are being challenged to look beyond crises to the underlying causes of (problems). Unemployed, sick and angry populations can, and often do, lead to conflict, dictators and demagogues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992, one of the strongest premises of your campaign was to focus on jobs and growth. Many factors could obviously go into making this happen.  However, weak foreign markets (diminished by debt and declining standards of living brought on by SAPs), such as Africa's, work against jobs for Americans. One study estimates that 20,000 US jobs are being lost yearly as a result of IMF and World Bank loans and SAPs. We are reminded by what another one of your key policy advisors said in 1992: &quot;foreign policy and domestic policy can no longer be divorced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related matter, we recall that during your campaign you repeatedly said that you would seek fair trade agreements that would benefit labor and the environment. Yet, by your administration's support for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT), without significant changes from your predecessor, Africans, labor and environmentalists will have little say in the new and secretive World Trade Organization (WTO). In economic terms, the Organization for Economic Cooperation(OECD) estimates that by the year 2002 Africa will be losing $2.6 billion a year as a result of GATT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A trade agreement that included at least a minimum base of environmental, social and economic standards might help everyone. Such an agreement could begin with the European Community's Social Charter as a possible model. Your election represented an opportunity to mold a bold new vision, together with citizen movements around the world, for fair and just trade. With Congress just beginning it's work on implementing GATT, your administration still has time to reconsider how the treaty is carried out or, even under its current guise, whether it is implemented at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign aid is another area where positive reform seemed within reach in 1992. Unfortunately, what you started now appears mired in special interest politics, far away from the lofty goals you once professed for moving foreign aid toward sustainable, participatory development- and for remaking government in the interests of greater popular participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What disappoints us most about your administration to date is its lack of vision and ideas. Without these there can be no hope, and certainly little reform. By failing in these areas, a leadership vacuum has been created which is increasingly being filled by conservative and anti-aid, anti-democratic, and anti-international actors. What concerns us even more is that in place of convictions we are witnessing political expediency-whereby human rights, democracy and economic justice are sacrificed on the alter of compromise with the very forces who opposed much of what you stood for in your campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than two years into your administration, we hear human rights people telling us that things were better under President Bush. In Kenya, where the U.S. embassy played a constructive role in 1990 and 1991, an opposition party member recently said that our embassy is now irrelevant to the democratization struggle here.&quot; Grassroots people and church folk inform us that for them they see little difference, in economic or political terms, now than during the Cold War- even that things may have gotten worse. We regularly speak with Africanists and Africans who tell us that all they see today from the U.S. is continuity and Cold War holdovers in the State Department. Instead of global economic opportunity, participation and new directions, we see in Africa declining living standards, more debt and SAPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously the U.S. cannot solve all the world's problems by itself but as the major global superpower it can play a critical role in mobilizing resources, providing programmatic leadership and supporting a positive moral climate. Unfortunately, today many people say that with your administration hope for these things has been lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question for us is: what distinguishes your administration from its predecessors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we sent you our memorandum in 1992, we did so because you were elected on a broad platform of change, one that appeared to separate you from the past and laid out a positive, democratic vision for the future. The United States, we thought, help might bring in a new era for a new time. Your platform talked of jobs, democracy, reform, and human rights. It is these basic, decent things that you stood for that we are now challenging you to return to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We imagine that you might use your good offices as an educational pulpit where you can take stands for:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-equitable, sustainable and democratic multi-lateral institutions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-foreign aid that is participatory, supportive of people at the base, democratic and de-linked from Cold War legacies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-debt write-offs for low income nations (especially in Africa where bilateral and multi-lateral loans prevail);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-a GATT that involves fair trade practices and that seeks to raise environmental standards and working and living conditions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-a stronger UN that is able to better respond to international humanitarian/conflict crises;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-moral and financial support for African peacekeeping initiatives; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-a human rights policy that is consistent, and that places democracy and justice above commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, we would like to encourage you to seek out non-official and alternative voices and sources for information on Africa. There are a lot of creative, democratic people in the world who are hot heard but who offer many ideas for the challenges we have raised here. It would be our pleasure to facilitate any such contacts or to send you resources. We pray that in these next months, you will see that there is still time to act on behalf of Africa, and regain the foreign policy initiative that you so promisingly began two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">January 11, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following is a prepared statement by the new chairwoman of the Africa subcommittee of the International Relations Committee in the U.S.  House of Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. The Republican Congresswoman from Florida assumed the post from Harry Johnston, a Florida Democract, following the Republican takeover of Congress which gives that party all committee and subcommittee chairmanships.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Cuba in 1951, Ros-Lehtinen came to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro took power. A former school administrator, she she won her seat representing Miami in Congress in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We plan to determine what are the U.S. priorities in Africa as they relate to the U.S. national interest, and to monitor to what extent the Clinton Administration and U.S. agencies are pursuing them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The subcommittee will also review the role of U.S. intervention in internal domestic conflicts, and their resolution, as well as review what role if any, the U.S. should play in relief operations. Moreover, the subcommittee will look at U.S. trade and investment opportunities in Africa by working with the different agencies and business organisations both in the U.S. and Africa.Africa, like much of the world, is undergoing great changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. must do all it can to assure that these changes lead to the expansion of democracy and free markets in the region. Human rights has been a long-standing concern for me and we hope to focus on problem areas in order to improve the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are some shining lights in Africa -- countries that are firmly on the road to democratic reform, human rights, and free markets -- but many countries, unfortunately, are still far from getting on that road.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African acappella singers, are on a winter tour of the United States before beginning rehearsals for an original play by the group's lead singer, Joseph Shabalala, that will open in Chicago this spring. Ladysmith is a friends and family group, which includes brothers and cousins and fathers and sons performing and traveling together. Africa News Service caught up with them at the beginning of the tour in Washington, D.C., where they appeared on National Public Radio's call-in show &quot;Talk of the Nation.&quot; Tamela Hultman of Africa News spoke with Joseph Shabalala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Being on tour sounds to many people as though it would be a glamorous affair, but I know it is extremely hard work. How do you cope with the pressures?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Because we are a group, we are always together and we practice together; it's not as tough as for other people because we are full time in music -- we always practice. But it is different than home, you miss home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: You travel a lot, though, so you're missing home much of the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: You do but you feel like you must go (perform), because you are just like a preacher, like a teacher. You must go, because we have something for the people that we call our gift from God. That's why we love people to come and see us!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: So you're saying your music is a kind of mission?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Exactly. A mission. In fact, this type of music -- the nature of this group Lady Smith Black Mambazo -- is to spread our culture and its tradition, to encourage our musicians and composers that their music should remain as close as possible to their roots. Many times they think maybe they must be imitating other people instead of sharing their own gifts.  Ladysmith Black Mambazo are like teachers, to share this culture that is our gift all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How much time do you spend performing at home in South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Since 1986, the time when we started to tour with Paul Simon, it looks like the demand in other places was more than at home. At that time people at home were angry and they have no time to do things to promote this type of music. Working together with Paul Simon we met a lot of people who love our harmony, and it means that now we work more outside than home. Now everything is settling at home; we can go back home and spend more time with our people there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How do you answer the people who say Paul Simon took your music and exploited it for his own benefit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Paul Simon used our music, yes. This kind of music is meant to be used by many people. Paul Simon used our music, but he helped us in so many ways, he became our friend. Because of him our music is known in this country, all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Many people see Africa as a continent where everyone is hopeless and everything is hopeless, because so much of the news coming from Africa seems to be bad. Yet many Africans feel that this is a very hopeful time. How do you feel about the future in South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Everybody has to have hope. I'm a person who has hope all the time. Even from the beginning, people were asking me questions about South Africa and I told them that South Africa would be an example to the world. As the leader of my group, I had to show my trust. If I am angry or if I hate, I will spread anger and hate. But if I love, the group will spread love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened to South Africa was unbelievable. It was just like a miracle. Now it is easier than before to have hope. We know we must come together and work together and conquer difficulties together. We forget about hate. That is why we have a song mentioning all the South African (political) organizations, to tell them that the way to conqueror is to come together, especially when you are a leader of a group. If the leaders are angry, everything will be destroyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Can music be a healing force?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Exactly! That's exactly what my people used to say. They said we have a healing voice. And I agree with them because, from the beginning, I feel like God was asking me to send this harmony to the people to heal them. It healed me first, and then I went to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: I know that in Natal, your home area in South Africa, everybody sings for every occasion -- or for no occasion! So it's not unusual for a person like yourself to sing. But did you know very early in your life that you had a special musical gift, even among a people who are always singing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: No. Because, you see, according to our tradition, when you sing, you are just singing for the people, just to entertain yourselves. You are not thinking about singing all over the world. We used to have song competitions, and maybe you would be standing for your region, or maybe for your father and mother, to make them proud. But finally we know that this is something different than tradition, that this is a voice of healing for all the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: And you say that now you see opportunities growing for you within South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Yes, exactly, you are exactly right. This is the time to go back home and talk to my people with my music. We have so many dreams. I feel like we must establish something, we must build something to keep the music alive, to preserve the music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: You mentioned before we began the interview that you dream of establishing an academy to preserve South African music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: I think this is my last dream! I was thinking that my dream is over now, because I've taken this music all over the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then it came to me that we need a school. That's why we found somebody to be a fund raiser for us here in America. There are trustees at home. We are trying to raise funds to build this academy to teach traditional music, not only for Zulus, not only for Xhosas or Ndebeles but for every tradition, for every culture in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is the only way to conquer this hatred: to be proud to follow the footsteps of your ancestors and the wisdom of the ancient cultures. Instead of fighting each other, we will learn from each other!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: As South Africa has become more urban, has some of the tradition of inter-weaving music through daily life been lost? Is that already happening?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Exactly. People used to say we have the music called &quot;township jive,&quot; that this is our music. But that type of music is influenced by the western music, and we have many things like that. This is why people in South Africa are happy about Ladysmith Black Mambazo, happy we have young guys in the group, because we go deep down to water the roots of the indigenous music. Otherwise the music of our tradition will vanish, and eventually we will end up in a vacuum. It's better to build the school and make our children to be proud of what they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: How have black South Africans been able to maintain such a strong culture through all the years of difficulty?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: It's because South Africans respect traditional wisdom; it's a pillar of life. To respect it doesn't mean that you are stupid, that you always do things in old ways. But South African people keep the culture, because they respect their grandmother, mother, father, uncle, who have preserved the culture. Otherwise it would be something gone long time ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: So the strong family structure is a part of the source of the culture's strength?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Exactly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Talk a little bit about your own family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: My father was a herbalist and my mother was a diviner.  Those are the people who are working with spirits all the time. They depend on and trust their dreams. And from that time up until now, I dreamed of music. I was very happy when my children grew up and finished at school and they liked to come and join the group. From their childhood I was teaching them the music, but I knew that I was just teaching them because they are young. So I was very happy when they decide to come and join Black Mambazo.  Even myself, with the music I was respecting my father, working with him when he was grinding his medicine and singing there. Because that is the way he believed, that when he sings beautiful songs and he is grinding that medicine, that medicine would do what he wants it to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: So you don't just grind the medicine; you have to do it in the proper spirit?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shabalala: Yes, exactly, you're right. I'm afraid of medicine -- it's a little bit bitter -- but my music is sweet.<BR></SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is Chris Stals about to scrap the financial rand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weekly Mail and Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 24, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Jacques Magliolo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement by Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals this week fuelled rumours that the financial rand would be scrapped within weeks. However, according to a number of economists and analysts, the speculation seems optimistic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The finrand was introduced by the Reserve Bank to discourage foreigners from removing funds from South Africa. In effect, a company wanting to operate here would obtain finrands at a better rate than commerical rands for their currency. But if they wanted to disinvest the exchange rate used would be at the less favourable commercial rand rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals was reported as saying the Reserve Bank had secured foreign credit of close to R12-billion to support the exchange rate once the dual currency system was abolished. He added that the underlying conditions for the scrapping of the finrand were improving all the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pre-conditions are: the discount rate, which is the percentage difference between the commercial and financial rands, has to remain at 10 percent for a reasonable period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Massive buying by foreign banks of finrands in anticipation of the scrapping of the unit (before Stal's speech) is driving down the discount rate,&quot; says Southern Life economist Sandra Gordon. The discount rate fell to 10 percent last week and had maintained this level by Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says another economist: &quot;The low discount rate has, in turn, fueled these rumours. However, the rate is merely one of three pre-conditions which has to be fulfilled before Stals can recommend to the cabinet that the units be unified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gordon adds: &quot;Stals has said that the discount rate has to remain at a rate of at most 10 percent for a reasonable period of time.What that time is, is anyone's guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-resident holders of South African assets should not dispose of these assets after the two currencies have been combined. In other words, the pool of finrands must decrease over time. But no time frame has been provided by the Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would be best achieved by a continuing increase in foreign investor confidence in the country. This should, in turn, be reflected in a sustained reduction in the finrand discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, political turbulence such as the Inkatha Freedom Party's walkout from parliament is likely to decrease foreign investor confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actual pool of finrand deposits (on an annual basis) increased at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the end of 1994 to R6,4-billion from 1993's R4,4-billion. Speculation of the scrapping was further supported by Stals revealing this week that finrand balances had fallen to about R5,5-billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Unanswered Questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 30, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Utibe Ukim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anthony Ani, acting finance minister, was mid-way into the budget briefing session January 17, when a note arrived his desk from the presidency. Government was reversing its decision to remove rice from the list of prohibited goods and impose a duty of 150 percent on its importation.  For 1995, rice will stay banned. Ani was asked to reflect this change in his budget breakdown. He did. Later, he told the audience at the Abuja Sheraton Hotel and Towers that the decision by the head of state to continue with the outright ban of the commodity was a way to encourage its local production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government's explanation failed to impress many. Rather, it added to the unanswered questions that have greeted Sani Abacha's budget of renewal announced January 14. In business circles the decision was seen as a pointer to the lack of political will within the government to implement some tough policy measures in the budget that may be unpopular with certain interest groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rice importers constitute one such interest groups. Their operation is very profitable when the commodity comes into the country illegally. Sources say that rice destined for Nigeria account forms at least 75 percent of the total cargo handled by the seaport at Cotonou, Benin Republic. NEWSWATCH sources say that over the years, the rice lobby has successfully convinced government on the need to ban the commodity outrightly ostensibly to encourage local production. As a result of the ban, rice arrives the country at a more expensive rate than it would have been if it came in legally and a high duty was imposed on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, importers said that with a duty of 150 percent, it would still have been possible for the Nigerians to buy a 50 kilogramme bag of rice for about N900. Whether this is true or not, the sudden reversal has not helped the image of the government which like all previous governments appears voluble on goals but short on their execution. Nor has its decision to crerate two new minitstries- those of solid mineral development and women and social wielfare when there are ministries of mines and power and petroleum and mineral resources to take care of solid mineral developments and health and human resources and the National Women Commission to take care of women affairs. Last week, analyst saw this as a sign of unseriousness from a government that talks of downsizing and rationalising government operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1995 budget is part of the 1995-97 national rolling plan. For 1995, government expects a total revenue of N350.66 billion. Out of this, earnings from crude oil sales are expected to account for N200.64 billion, showing an increase of N7.04 billion over the N193.6 billion project for 1994. Government's revenue projection is based on the sales of 2.04 million barrels of oil per day including 175 million barrels of condensate from the Oso Condensate plan in Eket, Akwa Ibom State. Non-oil sources will account for N150.02 billion, an increase of 218.85 percent over the N47.05 billion earned in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increase in oil revenues is accounted for largely by government's decision to discontinue the operation of dedicated accounts and pay all oil receipts into the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. Out of this amount, N185.08 billion will finance the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC,join venture cash calls, national priority projects like the liquefied natural gas project and other capital projects in the oil sector, external debt servicing and the projects to be undertaken by the newoly created petroleum trust fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government says it expects to stimulate the non-oil sector to become a key revenue source for it as part of efforts to break the overdependence on oil. Duties are expected to yield N34.4 billion, while N15 billion is expected from the value added tax. Also, government expects to earn N97.618 billion from the adjustment of prices of petroleum products effected in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Federal government's expenditure of profile shows a total expenditure of N155.02 billion. Out of this N53.7 billion will go for recurrent expenditure against the N38 billion spent in 1994. ani said the increase of 41.32 percent is attributed to recent revisions in personal allowances.  Capital projects will gulp N44.5 up from N19.38 billion provided for in 1994, while another N57 billion has been set aside for the servicing of public debt. Government said the sharp increase in the allocation for capital projects was because of government's decision to incorportate all capital projects previously funded from dedicated accounts into the budget process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government says the budget is intended to restore the dignity of the naira, stimulate growth in the productive sectors of agriculture and manufacturing, create new jobs, boost exports and reduce inflation within the economy. It appears as an attempt by government to satisfy the demands for a drastic review of the policies introduced with the 1994 budget. The creation of an autonomous market for foreign exchange, suspension of the official foreign exchange, suspension of the official foreign exchange market and the abrogation of the foreign exchange act of 1962 were seen as moves towards deregulation. Abacha, said in his budget broadcast january 14 that the economic strategy of this administration &quot;draws inspiration from the recognition that free enterprise is the bedrock of a democratic political system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To achieve these goals, the government announced the introduction of guided deregulation for interest and exchange rates. Under the new interest policy will induce growth in the productive sector as it will serve as incentive for the investment in this critical area. It said that government will use a number of policy instruments, especially &quot;fiscal and monetary austerity and supply side initiatives to drastically reduce thte rate of inflation.&quot; It directed anks not to demand more than N50 initial deposits for opening new saving accounts in rural areas and N100 in urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most significant changes are in the foreign exchange area.  Although the government said it was maintaining the official exchange rate of N22 to $1, it officially devalued the naira in a process which many Nigerians are yet to fully appreciate. Government announced the re-introduction of the autonomous market for foreign exchange and said individual can now open and maintain domiciliary accounts. The official foreign exchange market, FEM has been scrapped and henceforth, all foreign exchange users will be reuired to source their foreign exchange independently. However, government will continue to but the foreign exchane earning from official sources at the official rate and keep same for its own needs and for the occasional intervention in the autonomous market that it has empowered the CBN to establish in order to stabilise the market. The government further strenghtened the national Economic Intelligence Committee Decree Number 17 when it said that in the foreign exchange guidelines that the parallel market remains illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government also abrogated the 1962 exchange control act which restricted the flow of foreign exchage into and out of the country, a move which Gbenga Akinnawo, managing director of African Paints, praised as a key to opening up the economy to outside investments. It also cancelled the Nigerian Enterprise Promotions Decree which restricted foreigners to certain areas and announced the establishmentof a consumer protection council to check unwholesome practices by manufacturers, middlemen and traders' regulation by another name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's budget of renewal and incentives, is another experiment which he hopes will return Nigeria to economic prosperity. He said that the budget is premised on government's belief that the country must not be afraid of experimenting. &quot;This budget of renewal embraces the principle that we should not be afraid to experiment nor should we experience out of fear,&quot; he said in the broadcast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerians are familiar with the various economic experiments which the country has undergone since its economy began its downward spin in the late 1970s. The Obasanjo government introduced economic austerity programme which was abandoned by the Shagari regime. The Buhari government reintroduced austerity measures and strict regulation of the economy but the government was shortlived. The Babangida government introduced the structural adjustment programme in 1986 to champion an economic reconstruction programme based on a free market approach. Under the structural adjustment programme, SAP, the government decided to float the exchange rate of the naira and open it to market forces. It promised other key reforms including the privatisation of key government parastatals, reform of the financial sector and the deregulation of the economy. The programme worked for a while but it suffered from abuse and haphazard implementation while at the same time exacting enormous cost from Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, Abacha's first budget halted the reforms and introduced stringent controls. Interest and exchange rates were fixed in a move which the government said will enhance growht in the productive sector.Abacha admitted last week that his first economic experiment failed. Negative growth within the economy continued throughout 1994. Said Abacha in his broadcast: &quot;The negative growth rate of the preceeding year was not reversed because of the constraint of the unconducive macroeconomic environment.&quot; Ani said that the objectives of 1994 budget were largely unment. &quot;Some of the policy objectives in the 1994 budget, especially stemming the high rate of inflation, stabilising the exchange and interest rates and achieving a higher level of economic growth could not be fully attained.&quot; He said that the national economy did not record any growth in 1994. From 2.3 percent growth rate in the manufacturing sector, Ani said there was a decline of five percent within the sector which the government projected would grow at 3.3 percent. Inflation was put at 70 percent at the end of 1994 against 57.2 percent in 1993 while fiscal deficit stood at N81 billion for 1994. The government had presented a balanced budget which had no built in deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Budget 95 is a marriage of economic liberalisation with government control. Abacha and his officials call it guided deregulation, one in which government plays the role of umpire and frequently intervenes when market forces try to make a mess of its polcy objectives. With the budget, the government has gone back completely on its initial rejection of market forces as the key determinant of the exchange rate of the naira, reflecting perhaps, the victory of the CBN over the National Economic Intelligence Committee, whose chairman, Samuel Aluko, a seasoned economist, has always advocated strict economic regulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH sources say that the budget was packaged with the intention to please most people, especially the international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, which have maintained their opposition to the reintroduction of government controls.  That way, the government hopes to be able to win over the support of the IMF for approval for its Medium Term Economic Programme which Nigeria applied for since 1993 and for which negotiations have been stalled. In its half year report for 1994, the CBN had asked the government to immediately adopt a MTEP as a strategy towards reversing the negative trends within the economy. In October, the CBN followed this up with a memorandum to government which asked for higher rates of exchange for the naira saying that the going rate of N22 to $1 was low and uneconomic and that government was being forced to subsidize the market heavily. It is believed that one of the key contributions of the NEIC to the budget was its advice to government that it was time to end the &quot;festival of foreign exchange&quot; which the official market had been turned into. It was learnt that the committee argued that in most countries where the national currency is convertible, the monetary authority does not announce the rates at which it plans to sell the national currency against a basket of currencies. The committee said asking importers to source for their foreign exchange will reduce the pressure on the government as well as the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH sources said further the move is commendable because the demand for the currency at the official market over time was unrealistic. An industrialist said that for most of 1994, manufacturers demanded more than they need because they &quot;knew that they will never get enough allocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far, reactions to the budget have been mixed. Olusegun Oshunkeye, managing director of Nestle Foods said the principle of the budget was good but the implementation will require a lot of discipline from the monetary authority and government. Akinnawo sees the budget as &quot;the most responsive to the enlightened opinion in recent years.&quot; He said that the budget has ensured complete deregulation of the foreign exchange system, especially with the abrogation of the foreign exchange act of 1962. Gerald Flood, resident representative of the World Bank in Nigeria, said there were encouraging signs in the current budget and pointed to efforts at budget transparency and the move towards deregulation. He doubts, however, how the CBN will intervene in the autonomous market as government has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Flood is not alone. The administration of the new exchange system will demand a lot of discipline and sincerity from the government and the CBN.  Already, there are fears that the government has effectively devalued the naira without saying so. This is not his problem, however. His concern is that while the rate at the autonomous market is bound to exceed N22 to $1, &quot;why is the government keeping the N22 to $1 rate? How will this be handled without abuses as we witnessed during the Babangida days?&quot; He recalled that during the days of SAP, there were at least four different rates of exchange, namely, the first tier rates at about N1 to $1, the second tier rate, the autonomous market rates and the parallel market rates. The first tier rates became a source of government patronage for interest groups and friends. Some airline operators, even those without aircraft, were allocated foreign exchage at the first tier rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH learnt that these fears are genuine. Just as the budget was being read, there was instruction from the presidency for the CBN to sell foreign exchange to some highly placed traditional rulers at N22 to $1. The CBN allegedly saying that the traditional rulers should be asked to pay the autonomous market price.It took some time before the presidency agreed to this, a source said. Once it did, however, the problem was how to arrive at the autonomous market rate. The CBN, the source said, could not figure out the rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Akinnawo: &quot;I have my fears that the foreign proceeds of the feral government may indeed be used as settlement for friends and supporters of government. What this means is that if someone is friendly with government, he may be sold foreign exchange through the back door at the CBN at N22 to $1 while authentic manufactureers and users of foreign exchange will have to go and buy their foreign exchange from the autonomous mardet at perhaps N60 per dollar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second fear which many people have is that the government is likely to earn more than what its budget shows and that such extra earnings has not been provided for in the budget. Budget 95 is based on the official rate of exchange. Government says it would buy off monies from the oil companies, and embassies at the autonomous rates and occasionally inject the money including its official receipts into the market to stabilize the naira exchange rate. CBN will sell to the autonomous market at the prevailing rate.  &quot;What government has not said is how it intends to spend the extra money it will make from this as this is not accounted for in the budget,&quot; a finance industry chief said last week. &quot;Will it sterilize the money to guard against inflation or will it spend it on frivolous projects?&quot; Government, he said, needs to address this question to restore the confidence of Nigerians in the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said another manufacturer in Lagos: &quot;Except government comes out to state clearly what it intends to do with its own foreign exchange earnings, we are back to square one.&quot; But the CBN seems to have prepared for this question. The foreign exchange policy guidelines for the year says that the new policy is to build-up the nation's external reserve. &quot;A major policy goal for 1995 is the deliberate build-up and strengthening of external reserves to enhance confidence in the Nigerian economy, strengthening the naira and pave the way for its ultimate convertibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are not the only complaints against the new policy. The private sector is beginning to look at government as being greedy. That may be true.  Government is the net receiver of most of the foreign exchange that comes into the country. Apart from the official receipt, all oil companies, embassies and parastatals which earn foreign exchange will sell their earnings to the government. With this, there will be only a few sources left for operators of the autonomous market. &quot;What kind of depth will the market have when the government has hijacked the supply side?&quot; asked a banker last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps, this may not be a major problem. Many believe there is plenty of autonomous funds coming into the country and that a well developed market can tap these independent sources. Besides, there is the belief that once the market takes off, the black market will be threatened as banks will compete freely for all available funds. What this means is that foreign exchange will be available at rates higher than N22 and this is with government approval.  On the positive side, it is expected to grant open access to people to do business in Nigeria, knowing that they can easily repatriate their progit.  For instance, government will no longer be under any obligation to provide foreign exchange for foreign airlines to repatriate theri ticket sales revenue. That has been a contentious issue. With the autonomous market, the airlines will be able to buy and remit their profits to their bases with ease. But this means that air fares for instance will go up. The current air fares are dollar based although they are denominated in naira. As the rates at the market fluctuate, the fares would be expected to respond to these changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manufacturers are expecting higher operating cost as the cost of foreign exchange goes up. Some are expecting that with the rates at the autonomous market reaching N80, their production cost will rise significantly and that these additional cost will be passed on to the consumers by way of higher prices. In addition to the above, the plan by government to lease out some of its firms including the four refineries, the petrochemical plants, the Nigeria Airways and the Sugar companies also means that the products of these companies. In the case of the refineries for instance to companies and organisations, both local and foreign, with known expertise in these areas.  Government will share in the profit of these companies. In the case of the refineries for instance, crude oil for refining will be sold to the managers at the commercial rate and in order to recover cost, the pump price of petrol will expectedly go up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tola Mobulurin, managing director of Capital Bancorp, said the decision to lease these firms was not proper. &quot;If you want to privatise.  Leasing is a far more complex thing to look at it is subject to abuses.&quot; He raised the question of effective management of the facility in a wat that depreciation is taken care of. He said a better option would have been a lease purchase arrangement where the managers has the option of buying the plant after a certain period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we want to privatise, we should privatise. Let them (lessors) take commercial risk. Let them take ownership risk. For now, who bears the obsolence risk? We can sell these things off for dollars and we will be better off, he added. He said that no serious entrepreneur will want to lease these strategic plants from a government that is supposed to be on its way out.&quot; Still, as most analysts said last week the succes or failure of the budget depends on how committed government is to its implementation. From past experiences, success is not guaranteed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 06-08, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Rashid Mudin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soccer on the African continent, is riding rough seas despite the fact that FIFA recently recognised its rise, and allotted it two more slots in the final rounds of the 1998 World Cup in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not a single nation on the African continent can say &quot;we are having it smooth&quot;. save for South Africa that is awakening to the demand of international football after 30 years of isolation due to apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cancer eating deep into African football scene is nothing but politics and money. These two factors have had incredible influence on the direction of the game; its success or failure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From Cairo to Cape Town and from Dakar to Mogadishu, the story is the same. It is only a difference in magnitude.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us begin with our eastern neighbor, Kenya. For years Kenya was the envy of neighboring countries. Not that the Kenyans were highly talented but because the KANU government cared and pumped a lot of assistance both morally and financially into soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regular presence of president Daniel arap Moi at matches would motivate the teams to success. For example during the 1987 All Africa Games when president Moi attended virtually every event that involved Kenyans and at the end of the day, Kenya walked away with most of the Gold medals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same year, Moi was at every match that Gor-Mahia played in Nairobi in the Cup Winners Cup. Gor Mahia ended up winning the title after beating Esperance of Tunisia in the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early 90s, Kenyans formed opposition parties to unseat president Moi, and most opposition was from western Kenya which is the country's cradle of soccer. Moi knows that too well, so he also chose to ignore soccer. The result? Soccer in Kenya is now just struggling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenya should have hosted the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations, but because the current leaders in the Kenya Football Federation (KFF) belong to opposition parties, the KANU government felt it would be a political capital for the opposition if KFF succeeded in hosting the biggest soccer tournament on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The KANU government felt it was better for them to forfeit the hosting right and pay a huge fine, than sponsor the Africa Cup of Nations. That is how far politics can destroy the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt is a known soccer force on the continent. The Government pumps in a lot of money, but they too are facing financial problems. Some of the premier division clubs can no longer sustain the foreign coaches and players.  Has anyone ever bothered to find out why Egypt is never represented in the CAF (Abiola) Cup?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One time Arab Contractors of Egypt was a powerful team with players from all over the continent. But because of politics, the club failed to get home support. Ahmed Osman Ahmed, the sponsor of the team, would at times even hire fans, especially soldiers to cheer his team in international matches.  Egyptians disgusted by Osman's schemes, introduced stringent rules against foreigners and Arab Contractors which had no political backing waned into the oblivion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon has as a nation participated at the highest level of football, the World Cup three times. And it was because of their quarter final appearance in Italia '90 World Cup that Africa got a third slot. But just see what has now become of soccer in Cameroon. Because of civil strife in the country, the game has hit its lowest ebb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon is struggling in their Cup of Nations Group One qualifying pool with just three points from four matches. Recently they were in Zimbabwe and lost 4-1. As if that was not bad enough, the team spent two days in transit, starving. The national team players had traveled without any allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1994 Zaire traveled to the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Tunisia with two warring factions of the football federation, supported by the government, and the other by clubs. CAF had to intervene before Zaire could be allowed to participate in the African Cup of Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Tunisia, last year, when the national team lost the first match to Mali there was a national outcry. The coach was immediately sacked when the team failed to qualify altogether, the fans boycotted all the matches. The Tunisian government had to come to the rescue of the tournament. Hmmn! Some fans even asked for the resignation of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does all this leave us? With one conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That in Africa, it is the politics of the day and money that make the game tick. Countries that pay its players well usually get the results. When Nigeria won the Africa Cup, each player was handsomely rewarded by the Abacha government in cash and other awards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Poor countries unable to properly finance their teams in terms of training and winning bonuses, will forever lag behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soccer has turned out to be a big money business, and in soccer success means money. In Uganda the story is well known, the government withdrew financial support three years ago, and what we have on the ground is chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national team is just struggling, the clubs are unsure of participation in the continental competitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Compared to the so called dark days (of Idi Amin)- and it sounds terrible. In the 70s when Uganda was one of the top soccer nations on the continent, the government of the day used to money in sports. And the NRM government cannot continue pretending about this. Money must be found and put in sports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless this cancer is eradicated, African soccer shall never catch up with the advanced nations of the world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 18-20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Hamis Kaheru</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First a man called Bernard Onyango left Makerere and took refuge in a remote place called Nkozi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then in October 1993, the Uganda Martyrs' University, Nkozi, located 80 kms west of Kampala, opened shop with two major courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then, short courses have been introduced. Last Saturday Onyango spent the whole afternoon seeing off a group of students who had just completed a course in &quot;Computerised Human Resources Management.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Co-ordinator of the course, Valerious Bebangamba, explained at the graduation ceremony that the course is the first of its kind in an East African university. Most computer programmes centre on data-based fields like accounting, he said, but as we enter the &quot;age of information&quot; it is necessary to modernise our Human Resource Management (HRM) systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The graduates were not young men and women. They were senior officers in parastatals and multi-nationals who are in charge of human resources in their particular companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ajiku Cyprian, Head of Administration in Uganda Airlines Corporation, who spoke on behalf of the graduates, said that he has never used computers in his twenty years in the field of personnel management. Now, with the skills he has gained from Nkozi, management processes will be easy for him, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Kategaya, Principal Personnel Officer in the Uganda Posts and Telecommunications Corporation, said &quot;We liked the course - except it was short.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The computer programme, &quot;Manage pro 2.0&quot;, took six days and forms the basic level for which the participants were given certificates. They are expected to return to complete their intermediate and advanced levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Saturday graduates whom Mr. Onyango said are among the &quot;pioneers&quot; of the University were given certificates in computer-based human resource management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech read on behalf of Vice Chancellor Prof. Dr. Michel Lejueune, Onyango said the institution intends to develop many courses in institutional management. The general area of management involves managing hotels, schools and hospitals and that all require specialised training. &quot;We hope to go into that soon,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is just over a year since Martyrs University started. Academic Registrar Onyango looks back with more than satisfaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he announced that he was retiring from his post as Makerere University's Academic Registrar in January 1992, a number of the varsity's alumni burst into tears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost everyone who knew Onyango, and even those who had only heard about him, felt it was not the appropriate time to lose the services of one of the country's most dedicated civil servants. They felt that now the university was opening its gates to allow in more students, he ought to postpone his retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What was his reaction towards this general sense of loss among the public? &quot;I was very happy. It means I had done the job,&quot; Onyango told The Monitor over the week-end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I had served for 30 years and others had to come in,&quot; he explained.  Thirty years in the same place-excluding the years I spent there as a student-is not something small.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Academic Registrar, Onyango had impressed almost everybody-particularly for his determination to catch anybody who attempted to sneak into Makerere using forged academic testimonials. He expelled many students in this category - including children of ministers and other &quot;big&quot; people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he left, people feared that the only government-owned University was going to become a haven for those who could afford to buy their way into it. It would be difficult, many thought, to get a good enough replacement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Onyango does not except this idea: &quot;There is nothing like failing to get a replacement.&quot; Any new person will come and see what is in place and start from there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At Uganda Martyrs University, Nkozi, where he has taken on the same job of Academic Registrar, Onyango is as untiring as ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, the University has two academic years, with a total of 120 students, and it hopes to admit the third intake in October this year. It offers two</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">courses: Bachelor of Business Administration &amp;Management (BBA&amp;M) and, Bachelor of Ethics and Development Studies (BE&amp;DS).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major problem Onyango is facing in his new job is lack of room to accommodate staff, students and administration. There are only five student hostels, each with a capacity of 30. If they decide to use double deckers the maximum will be 60 beds each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Academic Registrar says that even when the new buildings (currently under construction) are completed, he will not have more than 1,000 students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We don't want to make it very big,&quot; he explained, from his one-room office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The accommodation problems means that Onyango is mainly using lecturers from Kampala, most of whom come, stay overnight, teach the following day and then return to Kampala. &quot;It is not satisfactory but we are determined to push on,&quot; said Onyango in his usual undaunted tone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2987 words</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As recently as six months ago, any suggestion that a military solution to the war in the South was an impossibility and a mere pipe dream would have been greeted with scorn by the Islamic Fundamentalists military regime. The regime was not the only one to be fooled by its own propaganda barrage against the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA). Even many Southern Sudanese were taken in by the stories of the SPLA's demise, not to speak of would be credible media sources like Africa Confidential. Reports were rife that Colonel John Garang's security could no longer be guaranteed in the South, and that he was going into exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, times change and so do people's perceptions of the war in the South. Today, the supposedly won conflict that Khartoum so often boasted about, has returned to the political agenda amid calls for a political rather than a military solution. The Southern people are far from defeated and the SPLA is still a force to be reckoned with. Khartoum is beginning to take a more sober look at developments in the South.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fronts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main fronts of the past three years have centred around Nimule, Kajokeji, Morobo and the routes from Bahr El Ghazal into Western Equatoria.  The regime has been poised on many an occasion to evict the SPLA from the border areas. Troit and Kapoeta in Eastern Equatoria had become the stablest towns occupied by the regime's forces. All of this has started to change in these areas as the regime's forces have been pressed by a revitalized SPLA.  Some elements controlled by Khartoum have even resorted to banditry because of the lack of official supplies reaching their outposts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In early January, there were several news reports about incidents involving the regime's forces in the Uganda border areas. Apparently, a unit stationed at Kajokeji or Morobo, facing starvation through lack of supplies, slipped through the SPLA siege and regrouped inside Uganda. They brought along some members of the Uganda dissident group, the Lords Resistance Army, to help them negotiate their way through the villages which they intended to plunder for food. Some members of the renegade SPLA commander William Nyuon's forces also went along, presumably to make it seem there these were activities of the SPLA, if anything went wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The alarm was soon raised after the mixed force entered a few villages, and Ugandan army units nearby were sent to investigate. The force was largely destroyed or captured when it attempted to raze one village too many. Then the story of what it was up to finally came out. The Sudanese readily identified themselves, perhaps thinking that this would be a safer option than being labeled Ugandan dissidents. They stated that they had lost their way and crossed into Uganda whilst in hot pursuit of some SPLA rebels.  The members of the Lords Resistance Army appeared to have been forewarned of the ambush and most of them evaded capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the stories told by the captured Sudanese indicate that they had really entered Uganda to scavenge for food. That is somewhat different from the official version now being circulated by Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda's Version of Events</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda Radio broadcast the stories told by members of William Nyuon's group. They said they were being used by both the regime and the Lords Resistance Army to carry arms and ammunition. Their stories were given in full, no doubt in a bid to maximise Khartoum's embarrassment and discomfort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As was to be expected, the leader of the Lords Resistance Army, with prompting from his supporters in the regime, claimed all responsibility for the incident. He said that Khartoum bore no responsibility at all. Through the actions in Uganda his forces had launched in earnest the war against President Yoweri Museveni's government in Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The official Ugandan position blamed Khartoum for infiltrating the border area and accused the Islamic Fundamentalist regime of using the forces of the renegade SPLA commander William Nyuon to supply arms to the Lords Resistance Army. Uncharacteristically, Khartoum did not directly respond to these accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Limitation of the Renegades</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Khartoum's ability to make use of the various renegade factions in the South has seriously diminished in the present dry season. This has limited the regime's ability to launch any offensives, as it has come to rely these groups to harass the mainstream SPLA since the major schism in the movement in August 1991. Except for the cattle rustling raid in the Agar Dinka area of Akot last October, forces loyal to Commander Riek Machar have not recently been active. There are even doubts about whether the commander had any real control over the forces which raided Akot, with some observers suggesting that he claimed their loyalty in order to impress external agencies that he is still in command of a force to be reckoned with. There are signs that his own support among the Nuer tribe is dwindling due to his lack of vision and strong leadership. Conflict and division has escalated among Nuer communities since Riek Machar aspired to leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere, Commander Lam Akol announced last month that he has reorganised his own faction under the SPLA United banner. He has set himself a limited agenda of making peace with the regime in Khartoum. He has accused his rivals of incompetence in the field of leadership. It is not exactly clear what size of force Lam Akol could offer Khartoum as part of any peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inter-reliance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a strange case of inter-reliance and dependency, the renegade commanders have turned to Khartoum for deliverance now that their attempts to destroy the leadership of the mainstream SPLA have failed. In turn, Khartoum has increasingly turned to these commanders for deliverance too, because of the logistical difficulties involved in continuing the war in the South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commander William Nyuon once appeared to be a real catch for Khartoum.  Now he has discovered that the regime is in no position to help him achieve his ambition of defeating Colonel Garang. He is fast realising that his forces are being used as canon fodder by the regime, in order to clear the way for their own forces. This ought not to have been too surprising for Commander Nyuon because ultimately the regime never had any intention of sharing the spoils of victory with him. Khartoum had scores to settle with him from his days as a bona fide nationalist fighter. Commander Nyuon's forces have been reduced to porters for the other groups, in the wake of their defeat by the SPLA outside Troit in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fourth renegade commander, Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, remains marooned outside of Gogrial town in Bahr El Ghazal. He is still waiting for the regime to re supply his forces so that he can establish a firm foothold against the SPLA in the area. He dearly wants some territory that he can lay claim to, but his forces have only succeeded in engendering hostility in the local population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bombing Relief Centres</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In December, just before Christmas, the regime began to bomb Akon, some twenty-nine miles northwest of Gogrial. Akon has been a relief centre for more than four years. It is a United Nations negotiated relief centre in an area under SPLA control. It was established as part of an agreement between the SPLA, the UN and the Khartoum regime whereby the belligerents each provided the UN with an equal number of relief centres. These centres are supposed to be protected and free from military operations. Khartoum has routinely violated these agreements, seemingly with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Targeting Civilians</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective of bombing Akon appears to have been to drive away the civilian population, along with a small SPLA unit stationed there, so that Commander Kuanyin could take control of the village and make it his headquarters. This was also the intention behind the failed attempts to control Mayan Abun, which is equidistant from Abyei to the north and Gogrial to the south. Akon would be a far easier outposts to maintain and supply from Gogrial and also from Aweil, a larger regime garrison town some thirty-four miles to the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For some reason, Commander Kuanyin's forces did not move from Gogrial towards Akon. It later transpired that for the takeover of Akon to succeed, three important steps needed to be carried out. Firstly, the regime's forces in Gogrial would supply Kerubino with arms and ammunition as well as transport vehicles. The regime's troops would follow behind. Secondly, the aerial bombardment would begin on the morning that Kerubino's forces moved out of Gogrial. Thirdly, they would be in place to begin a ground offensive at Akon when the bombardment ceased. In reality, the co- ordinated attack never got started. Whilst the bombers were ready at zero hour, the ground forces were not. Kerubino had received no arms or ammunition. The Gogrial garrison had none to offer, they had expected that the army headquarters in Wau would supply them in good time. Wau itself was short of supplies and so the plans faltered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attack on Kuac</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, in the face of the failure of the Akon plan, the regime's militia, also known as the Popular Defense Force (PDF), attacked the Kuac Dinka population and of southern Gogrial and devastated an entire community.  The force arrived from the north by train on their way to Wau. Half way between Aweil and Wau the train stopped, troops disembarked and spread out to the East. The Kuac Dinka population was taken by complete surprise. Many villages were razed to the ground and more than 8,000 head of cattle were rustled and driven towards the railway line, no doubt to boost food supplies.  Large numbers of the Kuac Dinka were killed and wounded. Women and children are reported to have been carried off into captivity and sold on as slaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The objective behind the militia attack appears to have been to distress the SPLA. Guerrilla soldiers from the area might be tempted to desert and return to defend their tribal homelands when they hear reports of atrocities. This would have a knock on effect on the SPLA's capacity to wage war in the South. So far, the plan appears to have failed, largely due to the SPLA's high level of motivation and discipline amongst its forces. The defense of the local population has to be part of an integrated SPLA strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Western Equatoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main centres for Khartoum's offensives are still the border areas of Eastern and Western Equatoria. The Western Equatoria front is always co-ordinated at Wau in Bahr El Ghazal, with some planning undertaken at Juba for a push from the East. However, the reverses suffered at Troit and Kapoeta in December have concentrated the regime's Juba efforts on maintaining those fronts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since early 1994, the regime has ferried troops into Wau by rail air.  The town is now saturated with soldiers and the logistical problems are immense. The railway stops at Wau and the troops will have to head for Western Equatoria by ground routes. The terrain between Wau and Tomnura is ideal country for waging a guerrilla war and it will be by no means a straightforward process to get these troops beyond Wau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops have been transported to the northern bank of the River Bo, a point where the regime has been repeatedly defeated in the past. The SPLA is in control of the southern bank of river and so a successful crossing will not be easy. The regime has repeatedly attempted to use this direct route towards Western Equatoria over the past four years presumably because the alternatives hold out even less chance of success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alternative Routes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are a number of alternative routes. The first is from Juba through Yei, and the second also from Juba through Rokon and Mundri. The Yei route has been all but abandoned because the manpower is no longer available to push forward, as most of the allocated troops have been re-designated to the battles for Troit and Kapoeta. For the route through Rokon, there is a large force assembled at Tarekeka on the Nile just north of Juba. This force has failed for many months now to advance due to lack of supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other possibility is to make use of French assistance and attack Western Equatoria from inside the central African Republic of Zaire. So far the attempts to infiltrate troops across the border have failed dismally.  Soldiers easily lose their bearings in the thickly forested border areas and those who make it though have been easily dealt with by the SPLA. Khartoum still refuses to acknowledge that it is trying to infiltrate soldiers in from the two neighbouring countries, which is little recompense to the families of any soldiers killed in action. The regime has a policy of not informing families of the details of any details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eastern Equatoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime once believed that if it could defeat the SPLA along the borders with Kenya and Uganda, then it would be sounding the guerrilla army's death knell. Most resources in the South have been deployed in this area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SPLA has defended these areas determinedly because they have been their diplomatic outlet to the outside world. Kenya and Uganda have also acted as hosts to the many Southern Sudanese refugees fleeing the conflict, and have helped the relief agencies to carry out their tasks. Whoever controls the border area also controls the hearts and minds of the local Southern population, who depend upon outside relief. It is for this reason that Khartoum speaks about border villages such as Nimule as though they were some of the world's most strategically important cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troit and Kapoeta</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regime's forces are fighting a real rearguard battle to hold on to both Troit and Kapoeta. For the third month the SPLA occupies and controls half of Kapoeta, with the trench lines being two to three hundred yards apart. The SPLA has the town under siege so its troops are far more mobile and can bring in fresh supplies. On the other hand, the regime's forces are well dug in and have all kinds of heavy artillery at their disposal. They are proving difficult to dislodge, but as long as circumstances stay the same Kapoeta will eventually fall to the SPLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attempts to relieve Kapoeta from Troit failed in December and now Troit itself is under siege. The supply route between Juba and Troit has become almost unusable for the regime, so it has been examining alternative routes for re supplying and reinforcing both Kapoeta and Troit. One suggestion has been to use the route from Pibor on the Ethiopian border, which was originally used to launch a surprise attack on the SPLA at Kapoeta in 1992. Unfortunately, the logistical problems involved in transporting a large force to Pibor are likely to prove insurmountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nineteen ninety-five is already proving to be a difficult year militarily for the regime. If the SPLA can bolster its position in the South, then the chances are that the regime will feel pressured into returning to the IGADD peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional chiefs should not be given automatic ex-officio status on Local Government but should rather contest the coming October elections along with other ordinary candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was said by rural women from all around the country at the speak-out day organised by the National Land Committee (NLC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rural women were mainly speaking about their exclusion from the local government transition process, where they demanded to be centrally involved in decision-making processes around the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will ensure that women have access to land and a role in land management, which we are currently denied,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women, from rural communities in six provinces, reported that nothing had changed with regard to the gender composition of local government and that many traditional authorities were hostile to women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initiatives: They criticised the civic movement by saying that it is mostly controlled by men and tends to block initiatives suggested by women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They further called on the civic structure to be constituted with equal representation for men and women. &quot;Bodies claiming to be progressive should give substance to those claims,&quot; the women said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Over the past months, President Nelson Mandela has indicated his concern about the lack of women representatives in national government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We ask that he take note of the appalling situation in local authorities across the country and take active steps to remedy the problem,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around 20 women delegates reiterated one of the last year's demands in the Land Charter by calling on all Transitional Local Councils (TLCs) to be constituted with equal representation by men and women. The Land Charter was adopted by over 300 rural communities at the Community Land Conference last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A ship loaded with deadly nuclear waste, including weapons-grade plutonium, may sail through South African waters on its way from France to Japan within the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cape Town-base Environment Monitoring Group has urgently appealed to the government to notify the Japanese government of South Africa's formal opposition to these shipments and to support international calls for all such cargoes to be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This follows appeals by Greenpeace International, in conjunction with other environmental organisations, for the governments of France, Japan and the United States to conduct a detailed environmental assessment of the risks and dangers of the shipment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Greenpeace claims the cargo is the most concentrated, radioactive waste ever transported and the release of even a small fraction of this material could result in an environmental and public health disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After receiving a briefing from Greenpeace International, the Cape Town- based Environment Monitoring Group has called on the government to make public information received about the forthcoming shipment, and to describe any contingency plans it has to deal with the impending shipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now the exact route of the ship has been kept secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shipment is the result of an international agreement by the French and British governments to send back to Japan nuclear waste that has been generated by reprocessing Japanese spent nuclear fuel in Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the period between November 1992 to January 1993 a shipment containing hundreds of kilograms of weapons-usable plutonium passed the Cape Coast on board the vessel &quot;Akatsuki Maru&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 24, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE-TIME spy Craig Williamson's revelations about the March 1982 bombing of the ANC offices in London do not go farenough, former police Security Branch colleagues say. They charged this week that former Law and Order Minister Louis le Grange approved the plan after an approach by then security branch head General Johan Coetzee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two top-ranking former members of the Branch pointed out that Le Grange's advance knowledge of the bombing raid, carried out by seven security policemen including Williamson, virtually assured that the State Security Council and other cabinet members would have known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their claims corroborated a statement made this week by outgoing police commissioner General Johan van der Merwe that the Security Branch would not have engaged in operations of the kind without the approval of the State Security Council, the cabinet committee that managed the apartheid state's security interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confessions about the London bomb, as well as two parcel bombs that killed Ruth First, Jeanette Schoon and Schoon's young daughter, Katryn, in Angola and Mozambique, this week drew hefty denials from politicians, who said if the claims were true they had nothing to do with it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a former security police officer -- he asked not to be named but was at the time part of the &quot;Sanhedrin&quot;, the executive management of the security branch -- said he had seen a memo before the raid from General Coetzee (who later became commissioner of police, and is now head of the police academy at Graaff Reinet) to Le Grange, in which the plans for the London raid were discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Le Grange rejected the first version of the plan on the grounds that it was &quot;too risky&quot;; it was likely to be traced back to South Africa. But Coetzee proposed new plans, which included each member of the raid party being issued with more than one false passport to facilitate escape, and gave Le Grange an assurance that the bomb would be detonated at a time when lives were not likely to be lost. Le Grange then approved the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former officer said the correspondence made it clear that diplomatic channels would be used to send the explosives to London, and that the South African embassy there would be used in the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson said in his &quot;confession&quot; to The Observer newspaper in London on Sunday that the parts for the bomb had been transported by diplomatic bag, and that it had been assembled at the South African embassy in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Observer article quoted Williamson as saying the raid, as well as the parcel bombs that killed First and Schoon, had been ordered or commanded by Colonel Piet Goosen, who died some years ago. Williamson disputed assertions independently made to The Observer that Coetzee -- who was his mentor and is still thought to be a good friend -- had given the orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former officer said the extra passports were issued by police Brigadier Andre Beukes, then a captain in the Security Branch, and that the explosives had been stashed in a cake tin in the diplomatic bag, and addressed to an employee of the London embassy who co-operated with the security branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it appeared then-ambassador Marais Steyn had not known about the assembly of the bomb under his nose, but that &quot;it was the way it was&quot; that Le Grange would have cleared the project with the State Security Council and cabinet colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another former top Security Branch officer agreed, saying Goosen -- who was group head of a number of Security Branch units that included the intelligence unit which Williamson commanded -- could not have &quot;started a war on his own&quot;. For a project of that nature, a &quot;commissioner-minister memo&quot; was necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the plan would probably have been thought up by the intelligence section and Williamson, but that it would have had to be approved, in sequence, by Goosen, by Coetzee as Security Branch chief, by the commissioner of police, and by the minister. He said the fact that all seven had been awarded medals for bravery by Le Grange in September that year corroborated other evidence that Le Grange had approved the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both charged that Williamson, by naming Goosen as the most senior person involved, was &quot;protecting&quot; Coetzee. Neither Coetzee nor Williamson could be contacted for comment. Williamson was said to be in Mozambique, while Coetzee was on leave from the police academy this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Goosen, who died about two years ago, first gained notoriety as the man in charge of the interrogation in which black consciousness leader Steve Biko was beaten to death in 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others named by Williamson as having been involved in the London bombing, apart from himself, were Eugene de Kock, the former Vlakplaas unit commander who this week went on trial on 121 Third Force-related and other charges, then-Warrant- Officer Jerry Raven (who now runs a shop in Pretoria and was named by Williamson to have set the London bomb and fitted the parcel bombs), Jimmy Taylor, John Adam and Vic McPherson, a serving police colonel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson first made his &quot;confession&quot; to the ANC intelligence wing late last year, saying the new governing party had &quot;a right to know&quot;. This confession was leaked to The Observer correspondent Phillip van Niekerk, who confronted Williamson with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson then agreed to talk, saying of the London bomb: &quot;Jerry Raven and one of the others actually positioned the bomb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson said there had been a special regional interception unit at Jan Smuts airport that sorted all the mail in Southern Africa, putting aside letters whose addresses included certain names, acronyms or organisations.&quot;Everything went through Jan Smuts,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A parcel from a United Nations agency in Lesotho addressed to Slovo in Maputo was intercepted. It was taken to Wachthuis, the police headquarters in Pretoria, where a small explosive device was fitted. &quot;Some weeks later, a device went off in Maputo and killed her (First). The logical conclusion was that it was that device.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson told The Observer that the killing of activist Schoon and her six- year-old daughter, blown up by a parcel bomb in the Angolan city of Lubango in June 1984, was, like the First killing, aimed at her husband.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said a parcel from Gaborone to Angola, addressed to Marius Schoon, had been brought to his unit. &quot;They said, right, here is this parcel from the ANC in Gaborone to Marius Schoon in Lubango. Doctor it. We doctored it and gave it back to them, and that was that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson said the death of Schoon and her daughter disillusioned him with police work. &quot;That was the end of my career.&quot; He subsequently joined Military Intelligence, where he hoped to do &quot;proper intelligence work&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Williamson said that after the First killing a &quot;stratcom&quot; (a &quot;strategic communication&quot;, or propaganda project) to plant the story that Slovo had killed his wife was devised. It was claimed that First had been &quot;causing all sorts of trouble in the Communist Party central committee&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story was published in the Johannesburg daily The Star in 1984.  Later Slovo successfully sued the newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Former Sunday Times reporter Stephan Terblanche this week confirmed Williamson had told journalists after First's death that Slovo had been responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While not reported in the Observer article, Williamson has said that the First killing was not done by the police alone; a specialist unit of the Defence Force had helped transport the parcel to Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spy Drama II: The web of 'stratcoms'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Stefaans Brummer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE all-pervasive influence of South Africa's securocrat chiefs in the mid- 1980s -- through an intricate web of covert propaganda projects -- has been revealed in a classified State Security Council document released by former spy Craig Williamson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1984 document audits &quot;strategic communication&quot; (stratcom) projects run by the police, the military and the Department of Foreign Affairs under the supervision of the State Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The police oversaw projects such as The Aida Parker Newsletter. The rightwing newsletter was not started by the police, but the document says police &quot;are currently using it and much success is being achieved with propaganda against the ANC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Foreign Affairs ran a number of overseas projects, including a West German news service aimed at &quot;countering ... negative reporting on South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the South African Defence Force projects were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Guano, intended &quot;to build the image of the security services among all population groups&quot;;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Elevate, to give support to Malawi's President Kamuzu Banda;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Santa, which co-ordinated military help to the government of Swaziland;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Seeppot (soap pot), intended to influence the media and create front organisations to boost security aims;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Whale, which tried to build the image of Unita leader Jonas Savimbi;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Drama, to build the image of the Zipra opposition in Zimbabwe;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Balalaika, to harm the morale of Cuban troops in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Lake, to raise suspicion in Zimbabwe about the government of Robert Mugabe and &quot;inculcate dissatisfaction with the system of government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Zodiac, to &quot;use the reverend Ndabaninge Sithole and his party to sow dissatisfaction with the Zimbabwe government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Bisen, to raise suspicion internationally about the Lesotho government of Chief Leabua Jonathan and damage his authority among the people of Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A large number of &quot;church and cultural&quot; projects, aimed at countering the influence of liberation theology, discrediting cultural enemies of the apartheid state or building &quot;moderate&quot; values. &quot;Africa&quot; churches were, for example, &quot;influenced by means of front organisations such as Geopende Deure (Opened Doors)&quot; in an operation called Project Anvil, while &quot;revolutionary theology&quot; in the Catholic Church was countered by a front organisation called Total Family Planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These propaganda projects -- known in security parlance as &quot;stratcoms&quot; -- were aimed to influence attitudes and events in all spheres of South African life, influence international opinion, and damage the &quot;enemies&quot; of South Africa. Almost 2 000 SADF members, in addition to numerous employees of other government departments, were at the time working on stratcom projects, and the budget ran into tens of millions of rands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Front organisations, covert propaganda and the media were extensively used, and years after the &quot;Infogate&quot; scandal, covert support was still being given to publications to influence opinion, the document reveals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Authored by South Africa's top 12 security brokers - including then-chief of the SADF General Constand Viljoen, National Intelligence head Dr Niel Barnard, Foreign Affairs director-general J van Dalsen and police commissioner General Johan Coetzee - the document was the result of a study which aimed to improve inter- departmental co-operation in the implementation of stratcom projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authors call strategic communication &quot;one of the state's mightiest weapons in recent years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document says the police were &quot;currently involved on covert territory in a wide range of stategic communication actions intended to fight the enemies of the RSA on all terrains&quot;. Police projects included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The Security Forces Support Committee: It was started to counter the Detainees' Parents Support Committee and the Black Sash and was &quot;run&quot; by the police in co-operation with the SADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The Aida Parker Newsletter: The document says although the right-wing newsletter was not started by police, police &quot;are currently using it and much success is being achieved with propaganda against the ANC&quot;. The SADF, according to the document, also gave &quot;inputs&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Industry International: This was a newsletter, about to be launched at the time, which would have been run from London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * SABC - Target Terrorism: The document says this was a programme initiated by the police and police played &quot;a leading role in providing information to the SABC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A range of covert projects against the United Democratic Front, the student bodies Nusas and Cosas, the Azanian Peoples' Organisation, the SA Council of Churches, trade unions and community organisations, &quot;mainly with the aim of ... impeding their organisational capacity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Department of Foreign Affairs ran a number of projects to &quot;improve&quot; South Africa's image abroad. They included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Radar: This was a Paris-based organisation headed by one Leon Delbecque, &quot;mainly focused, by means of psychological warfare, to boost South Africa's case in Europe and the European Parliament, and to counter propaganda actions originating from the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A West-German news service, headed by one Jo(umlaut)rg Wilhelmy, aimed at &quot;nautralising or countering the extremely negative reporting on South Africa&quot; in the German-speaking countries of Western Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Projects to invite and sponsor opinion formers, decision makers and experts to South Africa. While Foreign Affairs sponsored the trips, the guests often did not know the true origin of the invitation or sponsorship, as these were chanelled through other organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Three projects on the sponsoring, acquisition and distribution of &quot;expert&quot; publications, locally and overseas, &quot;on subjects that can boost the case of South Africa, without the state being linked&quot; to the publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Agreements with the German PR firm Hennenhoffer to invite top foreigners to South Africa and the French PR firm Aderi to &quot;improve South Africa's image overseas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A yearly contribution to the Institute for Strategic Studies to &quot;boost issues affecting South Africa internationally&quot; by means of conferences and publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Financial help to the Southern African Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SADF made by far the greatest contribution to stratcom projects, and was allocated hard propaganda - &quot;the co-ordinated management of propaganda, counter- propaganda and information supply, aiming to influence opinions, feelings, attitudes and actions of neutrals, allies and enemies&quot; - inside South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Significantly, other government departments and &quot;institutions such as the SABC&quot; could be &quot;tasked to give the necessary support to the SADF in terms of, for example, personnel, technical support, etc&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SADF projects were divided into the categories of &quot;information operations&quot;, &quot;motivation&quot; and &quot;psychological operations&quot;. Information operations included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Projects with codenames like Alborak, Tadpole, Girasol and Becket, all intended to &quot;create climate&quot; for defined purposes such as military co-operation with homeland governments, or to start a Southern African Military Treaty Organisation. Project Guano's - perhaps appropriately-named - aim was &quot;to build the image of the security services among all population groups&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motivational operations included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Overt projects named Harmonic, Dipole, Honey Ant, Weefspoel, Watent and Bates, with the aim of influencing categories of people like school headmasters, youth and womens' groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Elevate, which gave support to Malawi's President H Kamuzu Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Tsafoon, which had to influence whites in the old South West Africa positively as regarded their future there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Canteen, which was aimed at hiding South Africa's involvement in building a military base in Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Santa, which co-ordinated military help to the government of Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Arianne, which used a Moroccan newspaper to build South Africa's image as an African power&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Flask, intended to boost South Africa's image as &quot;reliable negotiator&quot; in Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Layer, which co-ordinated and propagated military co-operation between South Africa and Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Psychological operations included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Seeppot (soap pot), intended to influence the media and create front organisations to boost security aims by means of newsletters, magazines etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Diver, which intended to influence television and film organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Babushka, which used student front organisations to counter Nusas, the Black Students Society and &quot;other radical organisations such as the UDF&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Weiveld, which aimed, nationally and internationally, to &quot;psychologically disrupt&quot; the ANC and organisations including SACOS, the UDF, Cosas and Azapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Breakwater, which aimed to &quot;psychologically disrupt&quot; Swapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Destitute/Yam, which tried to boost the image of Angolan rebel movement Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Whale, which tried to build the image of Unita leader Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Capsize, which aimed to boost the image of the BCP-opposition in Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Drama, to build the image of the ZPRA-opposition in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Detach, to sow dissatisfaction with the MPLA-government in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Balalaika, to harm the morale of Cuban troops in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Lake, to raise suspicion in Zimbabwe about the government of Robert Mugabe and &quot;inculcate dissatisfaction with the system of government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Zodiac, to &quot;use the reverend Ndabaninge Sithole and his party to sow dissatisfaction with the Zimbabwe government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Project Bisen, to raise suspicion internationally about the Lesotho government of Chief Leabua Jonathan and damage his authority among the people of Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A large number of &quot;church and cultural&quot; projects, aimed at countering the influence of liberation theology, discrediting cultural enemies of the apartheid state or building &quot;moderate&quot; values. &quot;Africa&quot; churches were, for example, &quot;influenced by means of front organisations such as Geopende Deure (Opened Doors)&quot; in an operation called Project Anvil, while &quot;revolutionary theology&quot; in the Catholic Church was countered by a front organisation called Total Family Planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Project Serato tried to discredit Bishop Desmond Tutu and Alan Boesak nationally and internationally and &quot;counter their influence&quot;, while Project Wanmeul's aim was &quot;to use the Zion Christian Church for anti-revolutionary activities&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Project Wolga's aim was to &quot;use an inter-denominational organisation&quot; to boost the &quot;moderate theological ethical views that exist in the Reformed Churches&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of &quot;supporting service&quot; projects were also run by the SADF, with aims like training selected members of all government departments in propaganda techniques, to train leaders of resistance movements in neighbouring states and selected politicians and others in &quot;public administration of a state founded on democracy and a free market economic system&quot;, or to &quot;train and place&quot; selected leaders in specifically targeted communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporting services also included the management of high-powered radio transmitters to transmit propaganda and block &quot;enemy propaganda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 12-man committee, in its findings, suggested that greater co-ordination could be achieved by establishing a committee, chaired by the Prime Minister (then PW Botha) and including the ministers of Foreign Affairs, Law and Order and Defence, as well as the head of National Intelligence, the commissioner of police, the director-general of Foreign Affairs, the chief of the SADF and the secretary of the State Security Council, to meet at least twice a year to evaluate terrains of strategic communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A working group, consisting of the security bosses but excluding their political bosses, were to meet more often to evaluate projects and propose new projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scale of Strategic Communication becomes apparent in the large numbers of government employees who were involved in it. It appears from the document that a State Security Council directive of 1980 envisaged a Strategic Communication personnel complement of 2 651, of which the SADF in 1984 was providing 1 931.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A budgetary addendum to the document shows that the costs of a planned expansion of the programme alone would be R53-million.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 17, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Mark Gevisser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela was so &quot;fed up&quot; with the ill- discipline and unaccountability of his estranged wife, Winnie Mandela, that he was resolved to drop her from the cabinet until persuaded otherwise by several ANC leaders, including Thabo Mbeki, the deputy president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At his Sunday meeting with the 11 senior ANC women who resigned their positions on the Women's League national executive committee (NEC) in protest against Winnie Mandela's leadership, the president said that, following her remarks at the funeral of Warrant Officer Jabulani Xaba, he was absolutely firm about firing her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told the women he had consulted with the seven ANC regional premiers, and all but one of them had agreed that the move was long overdue.  He would have relieved her of her duties immediately, he said, were it not for &quot;comrades&quot; having &quot;restrained&quot; him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The result was a meeting, last Thursday, of all ANC ministers and senior officials, and the &quot;retract, resign or be fired&quot; ultimatum that was given to Winnie Mandela the next day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A senior source in the ANC alleges that Deputy- President Thabo Mbeki played a critical behind-the-scenes role in convincing Mandela not to act rashly and to consult more widely before taking any action. Mbeki was then responsible for drafting the letter of apology that Winnie Mandela finally signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki's director of communications, Thami Ntintile, counters, however, that &quot;no such role&quot; was played by Mbeki. The decision to offer Winnie Mandela a choice was &quot;made at a meeting called by President Mandela last Thursday. It was on the basis of the inputs made by several people at that meeting that the president made his decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate over her future cuts to the heart of a core ANC dilemma: how to keep troublesome ANC members in line without alienating vital constituencies and encouraging factionalism. While there are those in the ANC who believe that people like Winnie Mandela, Allan Boesak and Peter Mokaba need to be jettisoned once and for all, &quot;so that they stop coming back to haunt us&quot;, in the words of one NEC member, there are others who believe that unity must be kept at all costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiating between these two seemingly exclusive prerogatives, Mbeki spent his week shuttling between the Mandelas, and attempting to temper both the irascibility of the president and the exasperation of the 11 resigned Women's League NEC members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps his mediatory role was appropriate, given that he is the ANC's political manager. But he too encompasses a dilemma: on the one hand, the shoot- from-the-hip antics of Winnie Mandela, Bantu Holomisa and Mokaba cannot but work against his primary appeal as the man who will bring international capital to South Africa; on the other, he has risen to the position of Mandela's successor in no small part because of the support of the Women's League and the Youth League; support delivered either directly by Winnie Mandela or by her lieutenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the meeting at which the 11 executive members resigned from the Women's League, held last Saturday, Mbeki -- who was called in to troubleshoot -- urged them to consider party unity above all else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said one of the women: &quot;It felt as if we were being rapped over the knuckles; as if we were being condemned for being divisive. He seemed to be saying that we should not cause trouble and just go quietly, by not standing for office. It was as if we were being condemned for being good comrades, and raising important issues ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Mandela met them the next day, the message was altogether different: &quot;He seemed much more willing to listen to our concerns, and gave the impression that the wrong people were leaving the Women's League.&quot; The result is a meeting of the entire league executive, along with the ANC's national leadership, to take place tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What upsets those who have resigned, says another of the women, is that &quot;our battle is being denigrated as a cat fight in the Women's League, and we are being accused of resigning because we are 'anti-Winnie'. It's just not true. We resigned because we felt we needed to make a vital and urgent point about cleanness and accountability in leadership.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rift within the Women's League goes back to 1992, when the then-NEC suspended the entire PWV regional executive, of which Winnie Mandela was chair. This action was taken after it was proved that she had used the league to mount a demonstration against the ANC after being suspended from her post as social welfare head. Shortly thereafter, she resigned all her positions in the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the NEC that suspended her were Baleka Kgositsile, then secretary general, and Nosiviwe Mapisa, current secretary general. Mandela saw them as part of a &quot;cabal&quot; plotting to destroy her. The next year, she had begun her stunning political rehabilitation by winning the presidency of the very Women's League that had suspended her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winnie Mandela opened the very first NEC meeting she chaired, in early 1994, by accusing colleagues of disloyalty, claiming that she had in her possession a report from ANC security &quot;proving&quot; that a group from the previous NEC had met in Welkom to plot her downfall. &quot;It was the first any of us had heard of this,&quot; says one of the women. &quot;But it set the tone of paranoia and back-biting from the start.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the Women's League has turned, under her stewardship, from being a powerful lobby for gender issues to being a moribund and ineffective body that has failed to represent women's issues either in parliament or to the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 1991 to 1993, when Kgositsile was secretary general, the league lobbied successfully for a 30 percent quota of elected female officials and for gender parity in negotiating teams at the World Trade Centre. Two of those who resigned last weekend -- Kgositsile and Mavivi Manzini -- were the ANC's female negotiators. Furthermore, the league generated reams of policy -- on subjects ranging from reproductive rights to land issues -- that assisted the ANC in drafting its gender provisions of the reconstruction and development programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the Women's League launched the National Women's Coalition -- a powerful national non-partisan women's lobby that was disbanded last year, largely due to the fact that the league, under its new political leadership of Winnie Mandela and Thandi Modise, decided to withdraw its support for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the conference at which Mandela was elected in 1993, the NEC was mandated to come up with a programme of action. The work, however, has yet to be done. &quot;The tragedy,&quot; says one of those who resigned, &quot;is that all this strife has rendered us stagnant. Instead of having a positive input on the RDP and being a strong lobby for gender rights in government, what have we been doing? Talking about setting up casinos for foreign tourists!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The woman does not believe that she or any of her colleagues will rejoin the league executive for as long as Mandela is president: &quot;I suppose we have come to see that our work in the league is not the only way to advance the cause of women. We are ministers and MPs; we'll continue to do our work outside the league.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Nation (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A little over 14 months ago, 19 weary leaders at the World Trade Centre ushered South Africa into a new political era with a ceremonial nod, which signaled their acceptance of the interim Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In just three days from now, the Constitutional Assembly (CA), made up of representatives elected in terms of that interim constitution, will initiate yet another process and set in motion the writing of the country's final constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They have less than 18 months to complete their task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, contrary to what many South Africans might believe, the task will be much more formidable than simply effecting a few amendments to the Interim Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost every aspect addressed by the Interim Constitution will be thoroughly interrogated during the next 18 months by the six theme committees set up by the CA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They will for example debate issues related to the character of the state, the structure of the state, the relationship between national, provincial and local government and even fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deputy chairperson on Constitutional Assembly and National Party member, Leon Wessels, says the search for the constitutional formula which will ensure the most representative and workable democracy will no doubt focus the CA's attention most acutely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The challenge is how to ensure proper representation in a democratic state of all its people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wessels pointed to what he describes as the &quot;adversarial nature&quot; of a democratic system in which a party winning 51 percent of the vote exercises 100 percent of the power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These are the rough edges of democracy that we will have to smooth over through debate,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This debate will have a crucial bearing on the concept of power sharing on which the principle of government of national unity (GNU) currently rests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it will, no doubt, be a lively debate because there is clearly no consensus among the country's major parties on whether to continue with the government of national unity or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eastern Transvaal premier and ANC constitutional expert Matthew Phosa agrees that one of the most fundamental debates that will occupy the CA will be around the structure of the executive. &quot;This relates to whether we still continue with the concept of the government of national unity-do we abandon it or do we find a way of accommodating it,&quot; Phosa says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We (the ANC) want to stress that democracy should mean democracy and it should not be stifled by all sorts of frills - government should unambiguously reflect the principle of majority rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he adds that the ANC &quot;would be prepared to make the necessary compromises as dictated by the objective situation in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa says he would favour a situation where minorities are accommodated in the executive but not in the rigid way that it is currently done &quot;because that tends to stifle the democratic process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One possible way to achieve this is to limit the obligation on the part of majority parties to reach consensus at executive level on governance broadly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But we should take them (minorities) on board and be inclusive and consultative in the our practice of governance,&quot; Phosa explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He adds that the majority party, which he is convinced will continue to be the ANC, should be sensitive to the objective fears of other people and therefore be inclusive in its style of governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the National Party has yet to debate the issue formally at its federal congress this week, there is some support within its ranks for a system of coalition government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP's Fanus Schoeman says the NP has not yet taken a final decision on whether the GNU should continue to be a feature of the final constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He reportedly said that it was too early to take a position because the GNU was working well at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Inkatha Freedom Party negotiator Walter Felgate says his party would certainly not want the principle of the GNU to be carried over into the final constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argues that the GNU is a farce and a reflection of a weak democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another debate that will certainly exercise the minds of constitution makers, according to Phosa, will be around finding a way to introduce fundamental transformation at administrative level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The whole question was debated at (the ANC) conference and some of us said that the only way of addressing it is to remove the protection on the civil service and people should be employed on merit,&quot; says Phosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We should also ensure that the civil service unequivocally represents the nation. At the moment, we are having to endure a very painful and unjust distortion in the composition of the civil service,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa adds that the third important issue that will come up for debate is the arrangement of powers and functions between the national government, the provinces and local administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I think we should more or less retain the powers of the provinces as they are but take the issue a step further and create a facilitating or liaison mechanism in provinces to ensure effective governance and implementation of central government policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa says some in central government have recognised the importance of liaison structures in areas where provincial governments do not have powers and have already started forming these structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign minister Alfred Nzo has already initiated the formation of foreign affairs liaison structures at provincial level. His land affairs counterpart Derek Hanekom has initiated a similar process for the formation of land liaison structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa says the constitutional debate will also have to focus on whether the country needs the senate or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the CA decides that the country does in fact need a senate, it will have to define its purpose more clearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The senate in its current role is no more than a structure that rubber stamps decisions of the National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A key question that will have to be answered in the course of this debate is whether senators represent the province or their political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Australian system, senators represent their respective parties.  In South Africa, senators come from the provinces but at a national level they represent political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This seemingly contradictory character of the senate will have to addressed in formulating the final constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NP would certainly favour a situation where senators represent the provinces, rather than their political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the debate on the senate is far from over, a considerable body of opinion believes that the senate should be retained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is important to the extent that all areas of the country should be guaranteed representation in the national legislature. It is improbable that the national legislature would be able to draw representatives from all parts of the country if the senate is abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If however, the senate is retained, its functions will have to be very clearly spelt out if it is to have any relevance in the national legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senators will have to be given specific powers and functions that go beyond rubber stamping decisions of the executive and National Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This does not suggest that senators should have uniform powers across the board. It is possible, for example, that senators could be given less powers in areas of fiscal policy and legislation and more powers on questions of social welfare or science and technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another question that is likely to arise is whether the new constitution should redefine the size of the parliament, currently made up of 400 members of the National Assembly and 90 senators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has in the past been suggested that parliament is far too big.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the issue of fundamental rights, Wessels says that, while the chapter on fundamental rights in the constitution already addresses many issues relating to the rights of individuals, these have yet to be tested in practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, the final constitution will have to accommodate a complete Bill of Rights rather than just a chapter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One example, he says, relates to the question of voluntary association of individuals. The question that will have to be answered is whether this right allows for Afrikaners, for example, to gather themselves into an exclusive group or not and whether such voluntary association would not promote racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An area which will also focus the minds of the constitution makers is defining second and third generation rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second generation rights would include socio-economic rights such as the right to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wessels says if this right is entrenched in the constitution through the Bill of Rights, the question that will have to be answered is: who provides the work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An example of a third generation right is an individual's right to live and work in an unpolluted environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While all of this suggests that the final constitution could differ radically from the interim document, members of the CA will need to conduct their debates within the confines of the constitutional principles finalised by the multi-party talks on November 17, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa says, while this is true, parties should be mature enough to amend principles if the need arises and should not allow their efforts to be hamstrung by limitations that the principles could place on the constitution-making process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But problems may well arise if parties in the CA disagree on amendments to principles they believe are &quot;cast in stone&quot;. However, according to Phosa, the principles are defined in broad enough terms and may not need to be amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wessels agrees, saying the principles are not narrowly defined and will allow considerable scope for debate. Citing the example of the principle which demands that the final constitution allows for democratically elected government at national, provincial and local level, Wessels says it is not prescriptive at all and allows for considerable amount of debate on the relationship between the three levels of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa nevertheless cautions that, in the event there is disagreement on amendments, the constitution-making process could experience serious delays, especially if the issue becomes the subject of court action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, he says, we should not exclude the possibility of differences in the interpretation of the constitutional principles ending up in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the conclusion of these debates, South Africa will emerge with a final constitution. If all goes according to plan, this could happen in 18 months from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is insufficient clarity on whether the new constitution will immediately come into effect or not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of the current consensus, the interim constitution will remain in force for only two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could confront the current government of national unity with a serious constitutional crisis, especially if the new constitution jettisons the principle of power sharing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa agrees, saying if the final constitution is completed before the five year term of he current government expires, it could precipitate problems for the GNU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We could have problems if you cut short the mandate of politicians to less than five years for which they have been elected. It could even create instability and potential for conflict,&quot; Phosa argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ways will have to be found, if the new constitution rejects the principle of government of national unity, to facilitate the co-existence of old and new principles until 1999 when the next round of elections are due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Phosa says that provincial governments could be sacrificed and earlier elections, costs permitting, could be held at a regional level, possibly by 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phosa argues that an early provincial election could also allow national government the opportunity to better prepare for the provinces. &quot;One of the problems after the 1994 April elections was the national government was totally unprepared for the provincial governments and we each had to use our common sense to get the work done. That is why there is uneven development at the moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While it is at the level of the theme committees that much of the debates will take place, constitution makers are determined to give tangible meaning to past rhetoric of public participation in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lack of public participation in the drafting of the Interim Constitution was severely criticised as one of the most important shortcomings of the previous process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University of Cape Town political scientist David Welsh said at the time of the adoption of the Interim Constitution that despite the critical importance of the document, there was no opportunity for wide-ranging public debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What scares me is that this might be a kind of harbinger of the style of government that we can expect in the future. I hope I'm wrong about that.  But I do have an uneasy feeling that this kind of contemptuous attitude towards the public may just become part of our political culture,&quot; he warned at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CA seems to have come up with the perfect answer to Welsh's concerns and have built in to the process its &quot;Public Participation Programme&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is envisaged that every weekend, members of the CA will travel to townships, villages, squatter camps and suburbs to canvass the views of all sectors of the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is through these forums that ordinary people will be able to make their contribution to the constitution making proves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the plan certainly appears noble in character, there are concerns about its practical merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Past experiences have shown that the tendency at leadership level during policy formulating exercises is to move away from popular participation, not because of a lack of commitment to democracy and transparency, but because of the technical nature of the process and time constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A serious obstacle that will confront the CA in the implementation of its programme for popular participation is the lack of adequate mass based structures at almost every level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Organs of civil society will no doubt keep a close watch to see to what extent the concerns of their respective constituencies will find expression in the final constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 22, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council this morning decided that Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, will be the seat of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, subject to the conclusion of appropriate arrangements between the Tanzanian Government and the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council, by unanimously adopting resolution 977 (1995),acted on the recommendation of the Secretary-General, who had based his determination on the criteria of justice and fairness, and administrative efficiency and economy. The Council also noted the willingness of the Government of Rwanda to cooperate with the Tribunal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking before the resolution was adopted, Rwanda's Representative Manzi Bakuramutsa, said that he did not share the view expressed in the Secretary- General's report that the requirements of justice and fairness meant that the Tribunal should be seated outside Rwanda. However, despite its misgivings on the issue, his Government would cooperate with the Tribunal to help ensure that those who had committed genocide in the country were brought to justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Tribunal for Rwanda was established by Security Council resolution 955 of 8 November 1994 to prosecute persons responsible for genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda and Rwandese citizens responsible for such acts in neighbouring States between 1 January 1994 and 31 December 1994. The Tribunal, according to its statute, shall consist of: two Trial Chambers, each made up of three judges elected by the General Assembly to four-year terms, and a five-judge Appeals Chamber appointed by the President of the Tribunal;the Prosecutor, who will be responsible for investigating and prosecuting violations of international humanitarian law; and a Registry which will be responsible for administering and servicing the Tribunal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the Secretary-General's report on the Tribunal's seat, today's action signals the beginning of the second phase in its operations, meaning that the process of electing the six trial judges could begin. The Appeals Chamber, which it shares with the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, is already in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Tribunal's first stage of operations began with last year's creation of the Investigative/Prosecutorial Unit in Kigali. A Deputy Prosecutor, Honore Rakotomanana (Madagascar),has been appointed. The office of the Prosecutor will be filled by the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Richard J. Goldstone.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All Africa Conference of Chruches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One has to look carefully to see signs of the hellish killing fields that were Rwanda six months ago. Kigali's streets are smooth, the bomb-craters nowhere to be seen as speeding aid vehicles, flags and stickers waving their humanitarian greetings, rush madly from one meeting to another.  Buildings pock-marked and windowless once again exude the sleek self-confidence and optimism that once made Kigali the darling of development agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is water and electricity in greater supply than neighbouring countries. Phones work most of the time. Streets are well lit and safe. More than 250,000 people live here now, more than half the population of pre-1994 days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out in the rural areas, the fertile valleys and hills are green, ready for the planting season that is just beginning. Enormous herds of long-horned cattle have returned to clog the undulating hills near Tanzania.  Once-deserted villages and roads are filled with people bartering, smoking their pipes, drinking beer in breaks between renovating their homes. Women, valleys and terraced green hillsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A first-time visitor from America asks &quot;Where was the was? &quot;And so, one points out the shell-shattered roof of the Presbyterian Church, the few unrepaired buildings with windows blown out and the severely damaged former National Assembly buildings. That is the only material evidence. In the hills if one looks closely, rubble-filled gaps in the rows of mudhouses can be seen where once Tutsi peasants eked out a precarious living with their Hutu neighbours in land-hungry Rwanda before the genocide that killed a million people last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are still a few church compounds left where the skeletons of those murdered in Africa's worst genocide in history are evident. Most have been unceremoniously buried in anonymous mass graves, soon to be symbolically buried by churches still in the agony of their own divisions and failures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One church compound at Nyarubuye still has some 600 or more remains of people hacked to death by matches and hoes, their bones slashed and broken in pieces. Grass hides the remains, the stench of death has gone away, flowers push through the corpses. The new government says it will preserve Nyarubuyeas a memorial to the genocide, which traumatized a country half the size of Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is, however, more than one face to Rwanda. Across the borders with Zaire, Tanzania and Burundi in muddy, fetid refugee camps more than a million Hutu refugees live in smoldering rage, unable or unwilling to reclaim the land they would normally be planting. Most of them arrived last year --although a few still trickle in along the porous frontiers --in two convulsive waves convinced they would be slaughtered in revenge by the victorious rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF)which drove the extremist interim government from power and established a Hutu-Tutsi administration in Kigali in July, 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are the &quot;new refugees&quot; in government parlance, those who are innocent victims, those who were implicated in the genocide and those whom the murderous militias and former army and government control through a variety of means including control of food distribution, coercion and outright terrorism. &quot;We cannot go home, we will be killed if we do,&quot; one ragged woman in Eastern Zaire complains, as she rests from carrying a yellow jerry-can filled with dubious water. Another claims he tried to go back to his village from Cyanika, a camp in southwest Rwanda which the UN is trying to empty through Operation Return, and was threatened by soldiers of the Rwanda army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These kinds of unsubstantiated stories are spread through the camps inside and outside Rwanda by the Hutu extremists who control the camps.  UNAMIR (United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda) soldiers, mainly from Africa, offer the refugees and internally displaced a free ride home under military escort, enough rations for a month and some basic farm tools, but few are taking up the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, there are the old refugees, Tutsis, who fled to Burundi and Uganda as far back as 1959 to escape the periodic massacres at the hands of successive Hutu dictatorships. The new government says some 600,000 of these have come home and that another 600,000 Hutus have returned. The UN simply says these figures are vastly inflated, probably more like 300,000. These two faces of Rwanda -- the optimistic, rebuilding, rehabilitating Tutsis and moderate Hutus who escaped the killings and the sullen, potentially explosive residents of the camps -- are both images of Rwanda today. The one has erased most of the surface scars of the brutal genocide and war which lasted for 10 murderous weeks from April to July last year. The other shields the hard core of killers (same say as few as 250, others as many as 30,000) who planned and executed the genocide and who are desperately trying to avoid the war crimes trials planned by the new government and a disorganized and faction- riddled UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The leaders of the camps, unwittingly aided and abetted by the UN and the international humanitarian aid agencies hope that if they stall long enough, they will not have to pay for their actions. They also want to rebuild their army and militias to invade our country or destabilize it further, &quot;says Christine Umutoni, the articulate young deputy minister of rehabilitation and reconstruction in the RFP-dominated government who, herself, lost more than 40 members of her immediate family during the genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is still another face to Rwanda, the 151 international humanitarian aid agencies which have swarmed into the tiny Central African country -- including the ecumenical Church World Action-Rwanda (CWA-R) an initiative of the Geneva-based Lutheran World Federation and the World Council of Churches. Most are donor-driven, others are extremely dubious including a number of U.S.-based fundamentalist sects blatantly exploiting a situation designed to raise easy funds from congregations in Europe and North America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The more legitimate of these agencies, all coordinated in some way by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), are caught in the middle, knowing they are helping killers in the camps but clinging to an outmoded or irrelevant humanitarianism which insists it is unfair to expect Hutus to return home until they are confident they will be safe from reprisals and that their land will still be theirs to till.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government argues, and UNAMIR commanders seem to agree, that the refugees should be told the days of free food and water are soon to be over.  If assistance were offered in the hills of Rwanda, rather than in the camps of Tanzania and Zaire, this argument goes, the people would follow it home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fear of violence and revenge is nothing more than an excuse used by the old extremist government -- which says its only mistake was that it failed to finish off all the Tutsis-- to deny the reality of a new government or national unity, &quot;says Umutoni from her spartan office devoid of the trappings of power seen in the agency compounds filled with vehicle, satellite phones, faxes and well-paid emergency professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The agencies, some of whom simply do not register with Umotoni's ministry, generally reject this idea, claiming aid is neutral and people must be fed. Some also believe that the government in Kigali is prepared to use force to close camps through pre-emptive strikes, a position the new government denies. However, it reserves the right to engage in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; if militias launch guerrilla attacks from Zaire which has occurred near the border of the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNHCR's special representative in Rwanda, Canadian Carol Flaubert, is quoted as saying &quot;Our job is to listen and support rather than thinking we can direct their movements. The level of aid in the camps, contrary to popular wisdom, is not really a factor in whether people return home or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Umutoni is less optimistic &quot;The world forgot us too fast and now expects us to do too much, too soon, with too little support. Our biggest achievement to date is that we stopped the genocide and returned the country to some level of stability. You lose sight of this achievement in the North in your daily round of problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We in government are convinced that the militias and members of the old genocidal regime must be separated from the refugees. We want them to come home. We welcome them and tell them they are secure. It is important that the old and new refugees return and are resettled. But the UN is unwilling to take the steps necessary, through a special police force, to keep the killers away from the refugees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Rwanda drifts away from the world's attention, with almost no functioning justice system, the demands for peace and reconciliation and healing of trauma are extremely difficult. &quot;Everyone wants it but no one is sure how to do about it,: says a Tutsi priest asking for anonymity in fear that neglect by the international community for Rwanda's plight could result in further, even unintentional, violence. &quot;We a reliving on top of a bomb and even one mistake could cause the explosion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government insists there can be no reconciliation without justice.  Most of its supporters, including the main Catholic and Protestant churches, agree but they also accuse the international community of taking too long to set up the machinery needed to investigate the allegations and prepare for the international tribunal which may be set up in Arusha, Tanzania this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some 9,000 prisoners living in terrible conditions in Kigali's prison built for 2,000, many of them -- including two Catholic sisters and two priests -- arrested on hearsay evidence who cannot be tried because there are no magistrates or judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Genocide is the whole world's problem. We could do this justice ourselves, but we think the world, which has a convention against genocide requiring governments to act against it, must make certain the whole world judged the criminals who planned this atrocity,&quot; says Umutoni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the tribunal is not launched properly and urgently, Rwandese fear that the old notion of impunity from crime will never be purged from Rwandese political culture. Amnesty is not an option for the government. It would only encourage acts of rough justice in the villages and individual acts of revenge, officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A tribunal would also accomplish the task of separating the planners of the genocide from the innocent. Surviving Hutus, many of whom also lost family members, feel they all stand accused of genocide. &quot;It is very painful to be a Hutu Tuesdays. The mass media paints us all as killers and rapists, but many of us tried very hard to saves lives,&quot; says Anglican Bishop Norman Kayumba, acting dean of the country's Episcopal bishops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tribunal could also serve as a deterrent to other countries in the world who see genocide as the &quot;final solution&quot; to their problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile Rwanda's neighbours are fearful of further destabilization in Central and East Africa. Burundi, with a similar ethnic mix teeters on a knife edge as the government stumbles from crisis to crisis. Zaire is a scene of chaos and Tanzanian refugees seem settled in their Ngara camps for along time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international humanitarian community is divided and unfocused about what to do. The government is badly underesourced and needs help especially in resuscitating the justice system. The international community must lift its vision beyond aid to less glamourous but more essential development assistance if peace is to be assured and reconciliation effected.  ends.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ogoni Anthem, &quot;Aaboo Aaboo pa Ogoni&quot;...(Rise up, Rise up, Ogoni...) rent the air as hundreds of people converged outside the Rivers State House of Assembly, Port Harcourt last Monday. The crowd which was there to witness the beginning of the trial of those alleged to have killed four Ogoni citizens also chanted such slogans as: &quot;Ogoni must survive&quot; and &quot;Ken Saro-Wiwa must be free,&quot; to protest the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a moment of frenzy, the crowd defied security men and &quot;seized&quot; Gani Fawehinmi, a Lagos radical lawyer, carried him shoulder high and danced around with him, apparently to add colour to the protest. Though, security men had blocked the Boro-Port Harcourt highway early that morning to prevent the Ogonis from coming to demostrate at the trial venue, hundreds of them managed to reach Port Harcourt anyway. In fact, the crowd had stared gathering outside the trial venue as early as 6.00 a.m.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As expectations grew, a black maria, escorted by policemen and soldiers, drove to the venue and made for a hidden part of the premises to discharge its human cargo. Only a photographer and a video camera man, both of them from Government House, Port Harcourt, were allowed to see Ken Saro-Wiwa, a playwright and leader of the Ogonis, alight from the black maria. &quot;It was necessary to prevent something similar to the mistake they made in Abuja where they allowed Moshood Abiola, acclaimed winner of the June 12 1993 presidential election, to alight from a black maria in the full glare of everybody,&quot; a security man confided to &quot;Newswatch&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa and four others -- Ledum Mittee, a legal practicioner and deputy president of MOSOP;Barinem Nubari Kiobel, a former commissioner in Rivers State; John Kpuinien, deputy president of National Youth Council of Ogoni, NYCOP, and Bambor Bera, a youth from Bera village, are facing a four count charge of murder under item 13 Schedule I Cap. 53 of Section 316 of the criminal code. They are accused of the murder of Albert Badey, a former secretary to the Rivers State government, Edward Kobani, Samuel Orage and Theophilus Orage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa, who is first accused person, Mittee and Kiobel, second and third accused persons respectively, are alleged to have counselled and procured Kpuinien and Bera the fourth and fifth accused persons respectively, in company of others who are at large, to inflict grievous harm on participants at the council of chiefs meeting at Giokoo in Gokana, Rivers State, on May 21, last year. As a result of their action, the prosecution alleges, Badey, Kobani, and the Orage brothers were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Philip Umeadi led three other lawyers for the prosecution, while Fawehinmi led 16 lawyers including Olisah Agbakoba and Femi Falana, two human rights activists, for the first, second, and fourth accused persons. The third accused person was represented by S.A. Arorogun. The fifth accused person was not represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ibrahim Auta, a high court judge, and head of a three-man tribunal set up by the federal government to try the accused persons, left no one in doubt that the case must be quickly heard. He said it will continue daily until it ends. &quot;Counsels should do sway with objections and motions that will affect the conduct of the case,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the proceedings ran into an early hitch with the non-representation of the fifth accused person by a counsel. Auta had persuaded Fawehinmi to represent him or get any of the human rights lawyers in his team to do the job. But Fawehinmi said it would be unprofessional to do so, since the accused person is also working for the prosecution as a witness. As a result Auta said the case will have to be adjourned for a day to enable the fifth accused person to get legal counsel. But the case ended up being adjourned for two weeks when Fawehinmi said he had not made any contacts with his clients. &quot;Every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to adequate time and facility to defend himself,&quot; he said. He observed that the prosecution had spent the past eight months preparing its case. But Fawehinimi's attempt to get bail for the accused persons failed.  The tribunal ruled that he should defer his arguments for bail until the case resumes February 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The session was not without some embarrassing moments. For example, when Umeadi denied that the fifth accused person was working as a witness for prosecution, Fawehinmi showd him documents in which the prosecution had listed him as a witness. An embarrassed Umeadi then formally asked the tribunal to allow him to drop the accused as one of the witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the prosecution was embarrassed even further when Fawehinmi pointed out another mistake. The prosecution had wrongly charged the accused persons under the (Special Tribunal) Act Cap 53, which is no longer in existance, rather than the (Special Tribunal) Decree Cap 53. This was promptly corrected. But Fawehinmi threw the tribunal into laughter when he obsered that the mistake was made by very senior lawyers: Umeadi and M.A. Agbamuche, federal attorney-general and minister of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emotions rose when Fawehinmi attacked the military for keeping some of the accused persons in a military barracks. &quot;What is the business of the army in this matter?&quot; he asked. He said in the history of the judiciary never had an accused person been kept with the army. He argued that they should be kept in prison custody and not with the army. Umeadi, however, countered the argument saying that it was better to keep them with the army since the prison is not as safe as the miliary barracks. He argue further that there was no suggestion of torture or ill-treatment of the accused persons while in the custody of the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An angry Fawehinmi observed that Saro-Wiwa, was put in chains fo r54 days and slo beaten up during the period. As a vetern of 15 prisons, Fawehinmi said the prison is safer than the barracks. He siad it had never happened before that persons charged for murder are kept in army barracks. He challenged Umeadi to cite just one case whre such had happened before. Umeadi remained seated and stared helplessly at Fawehinmi. The tribunal, however, ruled that the status quo be maintained pending the resumption of the trial on February 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paul Okuntimo, a lieutenant colonel, in whose custody the accused persons are kept took on Fawehinmi after the adjournment. Farwehinmi had attempted to talk to Saro-Wiwa as he made for the black maria when Okuntimo roughly stopped him. An angry Fawehinmi pointed at the army officer and addressed him as Mister Okuntimo. &quot;Don't point your fingers at an army officer and don't address me as mister, I am a lieutenant colonel&quot; Okuntimo shouted ar Fawehinmi. &quot;I don't care who you are,&quot; Fawehinmi shouted back. For a few minutes both men exchanged harsh words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial has generated interest even outside Rivers State. An organisation which calls itself Niger Delta Liberation Movement, observed last week that justice for Saro-Wiwa is justice for all oil producing communities. Foreign journalists and foreign observers were also at teh venue to observe the proceedings. One of the observers is from the British High Commission while amother is a representative of the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even with the commencement of the trial last Monday, the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force, which since May, last year has been arresting the Ogonis in connection with the Giokoo murder, raided K-Dere, home town of Mitee in the night. A number of people were arrested including Mittee's sister and her son.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senate Subcommittee Hearing on Trade and Investment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Subject: U.S. Trade and Investment in Sub-Saharan Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good afternoon, Madame Chairman and Members of the committee. My name is Franklin Kennedy and I am President and CEO of Equator Bank Limited. I am also a director of the Corporate Council on Africa and the African Business Roundtable, whose memberships are highly committed to increasing U.S. trade and investment in Africa. Equator and General Motors, who is also testifying today, were among the CCA's founding members. Thank you for the opportunity to share with you some views on U.S. business activity in Africa and on the continued development of this market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past 20 years, Equator has operated exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa, founded with the belief that Africa presented an under-served market with tremendous potential for a specialized financial institution. We have worked in the majority of countries in the region and have offices in Ghana, Kenya, Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and South Africa as well as in London, Nassau, Washington, and Glastonbury Connecticut. Our major shareholders are the Hongkong Group and, since early 1994, Nedbank of South Africa. Equator has 100 employees, including American, European and African professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I will briefly introduce Equator's 3 lines of business: merchant banking, import-export trading and investment banking. If I may, I will also mention some examples that illustrate the potential to increase American business in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equator has provided trade financing, short-and-medium-term lending and correspondent banking services in Africa since start-up in 1975. We have provided roughly $5 billion in financing to African public and private clients. Equator like many other lenders undertook its own &quot;structural adjustment program&quot; during the debt crisis of the late 1980s, but some of us continued on and many more are back in the African market now, so that competition in banking has heated up considerably. Equator has worked closely with OPIC, USAID, Eximbank and the multilateral institutions the U.S.  supports, such as UNDP, the African Development Bank, the World Bank, IFC and the IMF, and we have close ties with African central and new African Export-Import Bank, along with Citibank and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equator Bank Limited</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equator's trading company supports commercial activity and capital investment in Africa in sectors such as transport, communications, power, mining and housing. It acts in a number of capacities, such as representing U.S. companies or serving as procurement agent for African buyers. Much of the business has involved U.S. suppliers. Some are big exporters, such as Motorola, GM, Chrysler, Mack, Caterpillar, Kohler, McDonnell Douglas and Beechcraft. But many of our trading partners had not done business in Africa before, such as Bluebird Buses from Macon, Georgia. Bluebird has now sold several hundred buses in several African countries, with Equator assistance and financial support from the U.S. government's Commodity Import Program, among other sources. A major selling point was Bluebird's flexibility to modify the buses in ways that were highly suitable for local conditions.  Surprisingly, Africa is already one of the largest markets for some of the smaller firms Equator works with, and for some of the newer exporters to the region it's been a real eye-opener. I would be happy to provide other examples to the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equator also helps arrange financing for existing private companies, privatization and new ventures in Africa, as financial advisor and as manager of direct investment funds. For example, the $25 million Africa Growth Fund was launched in 1989 as the first initiative of its kind by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and U.S. corporate investors. The AGF has invested in both start-up joint ventures between U.S. and private African partners, and in expansion of competitive firms. It has already recovered 140% of its partners' original investment. Most of its portfolio is still intact, with businesses growing and appreciating in value in 8 African countries. The AGF invested companies employ about 1,500 people altogether, who in turn may be supporting 10 or more members of their extended families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A larger follow-on fund, AGF II, is being established this year with continued US corporate and OPIC participation. Equator also manages the Kenya Equity Fund, which has benefited from strong USAID support. It has invested in tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness and other fields and can also be expanded. There are many more high-quality investment and investment banking opportunities in Africa today, owing to a much more receptive environment in many countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business Climate in Africa: I would now like to comment on this improving business climate and the potential for increased U.S. business involvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although aggregate GDP increased by only 1.4% in 1993, net of population growth, many African countries have been achieving strong real growth for several years, such as Ghana, Uganda, Zambia and Botswana. Higher prices for some of Africa's commodity exports have contributed to the expansion, but they are no longer the main driving force that they used to be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Credit must go to the deep reforms undertaken by many African countries, backed by coordinate international support. The extensive liberalization of trade, foreign exchange, investment, labor and other policies, along with more fiscal discipline, have reduced the risks and costs of doing business and investing in many countries. There are fewer distortions, such as overvalued exchange rates, protective barriers and subsidies. This makes it much easier to identify and pursue business activities that should remain competitive aver the long term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of particular importance to foreign investors and lenders, many African countries have built up adequate foreign exchange reserves while reducing their debt burdens. As a result, country creditworthiness has improved and local companies and their banks can meet their obligations on a timely basis. In many cases inflation and local currency depreciation rates have reached historic lows, after years of painful adjustment towards competitive market rates. The historic devaluation of the CFA franc shared by 13 francophone countries in January 1994 was a major step towards restoring their competitiveness and attractiveness to private investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial support from the U.S. and other major donors is still an essential ingredient needed by the reforming countries to achieve and maintain basic economic stability. However, in response to these efforts, private capital inflows are generating more of the resources Africa needs for its development. Recent landmark transactions totaling over $1 billion included Ashanti Goldfields' stock offering, PTA Bank's regional pre-export credit facility in southern Africa, and the raising of three Wall Street funds focusing especially on the South African stock market, which has the 10th largest capitalization of all the emerging markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all of the achievements, a number of African countries still suffer from civil strife and/or hostile policy environments. The stunning policy reversals in Nigeria following the coup do nothing to improve Africa's image among those who do not necessarily differentiate among the region's 54 countries. While having to provide massive humanitarian and peace-keeping assistance, the U.S. government has also closed aid missions and discontinued its support in some of the non-reforming countries. I can safely say that the business community supports tougher standards for U.S. assistance, as it focuses on its own tough standard on where to do business: the returns to the bottom line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in actively reforming countries, there are still constraints to U.S. trade and investment and overall private sector development. These include the relative scarcity of domestic capital and local credit, especially medium-term loans for investment purposes. On the policy front, privatization is still moving fairly slowly in many countries, with valuable assets and infrastructure waiting to be rehabilitated and/or expanded. The African Growth Fund recently spent many months working with Cocaq saw in that case and others elsewhere indicate how important it is for governments to fine-tune their privatization efforts with the technical support available to them. We are all learning from experience, while opportunities keep growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tax and customs policy and administration also need more work in many African countries. It's not just a matter of providing adequate business incentives, but also of reducing unfair competition and revenues lost to smuggling and tax avoidance. The U.S. Treasury Department and USAID are among those who are helping with tax reform and using U.S. expertise to do it. Some of these and other challenges are being tackled at the regional level.  Organizations such as Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the West African Monetary and Economic Union (UMOEA) are working to harmonize tax and trade policies, to promote regional market integration, including capital markets, to modernize corporate and commercial laws, and to carry out regional infrastructure projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opportunities for US Business: In terms of the opportunities for U.S.  business, African imports increased about 7% per year during the 1990s, to about $70 billion last year. U.S. exports have doubled since 1990 to about $7 billion, although still only 1% of U.S. exports. U.S. private direct investment in the region, measured at its original cost going in and not at its present value, is estimated by one survey at about $4 billion. It is worth mentioning that South Africa accounted for only roughly 25% of these flows. Its share is sure to increase, but its successful political transition and re-entry into the market have boosted U.S. business interest in the rest of the region as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Export agriculture, light industry, mining, infrastructure development, financial and management services are some of the sectors of opportunity. Based on Equator's experience in managing the Africa Growth Fund and Kenya Equity Fund, I can assure you that there is no lack of opportunity for investors to earn the kinds of returns they would expect in an admittedly riskier environment than the United States. The trickle of investment is turning into a flow in places like Ghana, Uganda and South Africa as African, American and other entrepreneurs recognize that they can control more of these risks through their own sound management, free from government interference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American businesses do not necessarily have to be on the ground in Africa day in and day out to sell their products. While many U.S.  multinationalists have representative offices in major capitals, African buyers and their advisors ranging from U.S. Embassy commercial officers to private trading forms are taking the initiative to search the U.S. market for the best solutions for any given situation. Some of the products from smaller U.S. firms that have been very well received on the market are low-cost, low-maintenance oxygen production units built by Airsep Corporation in New York state, portable solar panels from United Solar Systems in Michigan, and mobile telecommunications equipment from Transworld Communications Corporation in California.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Angola and Eastern Africa, Equator has helped introduce a machine produced by a small firm in Reston Virginia, MIC Industries, that allows a small team to construct free-standing buildings made of interlocking steel arches in a matter of days. Our clients have used this machine to build everything from warehouses and factory spaces to residential units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The potential is not just for newly manufactured goods or capital equipment. For example, Equator has shipped over 2,000 secondhand utility vehicles from the U.S. to Africa over the past 5 or 6 years, such as freight, fire and garbage trucks. While these projects raised cash to help U.S.  leasing and trucking companies renew their fleets, they also provided a cost-effective alternative for our African clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether the subject is trade or investment, the secret to success for the U.S. business person is to identify the high priority sectors in any given country and the serious entrepreneurs within them. They are the ones who are creating the demand for profitable involvement of U.S. partners, and as such they are a priceless commodity. They will have more choices of financial, procurement, management and other resources from the U.S. as their governments stay firmly on the path of private sector-led development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Government Support: With each passing year of increasing stability, U.S. direct investors and exporters can devote less attention to political and currency transfer risks, and can fully concentrate on evaluating opportunities in African growth markets on their commercial merits. Business is becoming more competitive in many sectors, with more players involved and more financing available, including bilateral export credits and concessional financing from Europe and Asia. As this Sub-Committee, the Congress and the Administration review the priorities for U.S. government support, you can do so with greater confidence that efforts to leverage taxpayer resources with U.S. private capital and to provide a direct return in terms of U.S. employment and sales will be rewarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would just like to mention some of the existing or potential programs that can promote additional complementary between U.S. foreign assistance and U.S. commercial and investment interest in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First and foremost, adequate balance-of-payments assistance, including continued participation in official debt reduction efforts, must be maintained for countries that have made a serious commitment to reform and still require such support to maintain macro-economic stability. In parallel, the U.S. should continue to provide strong support and send clear signals regarding Africa's policy reform agenda, with due regard for issue areas of importance to business, including privatization and tax policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been a significant increase in private short-term trade financing activity in Africa in the past 2 and 3 years, reducing the need for official balance-of-payments support. Eximbank can accelerate this trend by covering more countries, as well as considering new products that fit into the pattern of present- day international banking activity in Africa. For example, it could encourage further commercial lending to the region to both public and private sector borrowers by guaranteeing some of the risks of African export bills being used as security to raise financing for African imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African environment is also more receptive now for Eximbank to widen its support of U.S. capital goods exports to Africa. While the biggest transactions might still involve infrastructure projects undertaken by African governments, or big oil and mining projects undertaken by African governments, or big oil and mining projects, much of the demand for term credits is starting to come from well-managed private sector projects in other sectors that make good commercial sense. Building on its experience elsewhere, Eximbank can start taking on this type of private project risk in Africa on a sound commercial basis, in collaboration with U.S. and African banks and other private sources of financing. This would be a very welcome development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides expanded export financing, the U.S. government can help U.S.  firms invest and compete in Africa in many other ways. Seed money provided on a cost- sharing basis for market research and project preparation, of the kind provided by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, have generated more business in Africa in recent years, However, there are very few places to turn to for this kind of support, or else they are not well known. It can be particularly valuable to smaller American entrepreneurial firms developing investment projects or long-term trading relationships in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With respect to project financing, the second Africa Growth Fund leveraged by OPIC-guaranteed notes will be providing equity financing and value-added management support to private ventures, and the Southern Africa Enterprise Fund will do so as well with a particular focus on smaller businesses and with the capability of providing technical assistance to African entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OPIC itself has worked successfully to develop direct lending, guarantee and insurance products for U.S. investors seeking to mitigate risks and to complete their financing packages. With its track record of innovation, OPIC can keep leading the way in addressing some of the remaining gaps. For example, given the steady currency devaluation that have accompanied African adjustment programs and are still of concern to investors, especially in projects geared towards the African domestic markets, it may be feasible to develop products that help investors hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. Such products may only be suitable for use in countries whose exchange rates have already reached a solid plateau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that President Clinton has been meeting with many more African heads of state than other President is also very encouraging. Indeed, promotional efforts play an important in building U.S. business interest and confidence in Africa, and in matching up African entrepreneurs with suitable partners here. They have included Secretary Brown's visit to South Africa last year, the White House conference on Africa, USIA's conference in Atlanta, and the trade and investment missions that OPIC has led to various African countries. At the same time, private non-profit organizations such as the Corporate Council on Africa, the U.S. South Africa Leadership Exchange Program and Africare are also building the networks and helping to make the African business environment more user-friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, to keep building the market, USAID and other agencies can continue to support local business and financial sector development in Africa, through initiatives like its loan guarantee programs for small enterprise lending by local banks, and start-up support for business development and training centres, local investment funds and a new generation of capital market institutions. Multilateral agencies have also developed a good track record with programs that support the African entrepreneur, such as the Africa Project Development Facility and the African Management Services Company managed by IFC and funded by several other agencies, and the work UNDP has been doing with African business associations, among other initiatives. The U.S. business community should also play its part in helping African entrepreneurs and managers locate suitable products, partners and training opportunities, not only managers locate suitable products, partners and training opportunities, not only on a commercial basis but also through outreach programs that can be organized by individual corporations, associations and non-profit organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conclusion: Africa is on the right track and can rightly be considered a growth market for U.S. investors and exporters. Rather than reduce its support at this critical juncture, the U.S. government should seek to build on the successes. Coordinated efforts must continue to strengthen economic stability, deepen policy reforms and accelerate growth of Africa's market economies. Many African countries seem to be well on the road to long-term growth. They are different stages, but what really counts is the major change in attitudes towards private business activity. This increases the scope to leverage U.S. taxpayer investment in African development by stimulating U.S.  trade, investment and financing. I would be happy to discuss some of these opportunities in more detail and to answer any questions. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 16, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madam Chairman and members of the Committee,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is fitting that the first formal hearing on Africa by the 104th Congress should be on trade and investment. Those who see only news headlines that portray Africa as a continent of famine and crisis may be surprised by this focus. But those who have lived and worked in Sub-Saharan Africa or who have closely watched recent developments on the continent will recognize that trade and investment are indeed becoming a fundamental aspect of U.S.-Africa relations. I welcome the opportunity to focus on this theme as we intimate formally our dialogue on African issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is Undergoing a Transformation: A major transformation is underway in Africa, comparable to what Latin America experienced over the past decade. The clearest indicators of this transformation are the growth and expansion of democratic governments and institutions, paralleled by significant economic reform and liberalization. Nearly two-thirds of African countries are now are at the same stage of democratic transition, compared to only four in 1989. Many African nations have taken difficult and courageous steps to keep budget deficits down, maintain realistic exchange rates, and increase competition through domestic deregulation, trade reform, and privatization of public enterprises. The aim of these reforms has been to create an enabling environment in which the private sector can act as the engine of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. leadership and support are critical to that transformation. Our diplomatic efforts and bilateral aid programs have given significant impetus to democracy-building and economic development. Our contributions -- leveraged with those of other donors -- to the programs of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Africa have reinforced economic policy reforms and infrastructure development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transformation of Sub-Saharan Africa has significant implications for U.S. interests. First, the progress realize to date has stimulated growing interest and opportunities for U.S. business. Second, the emergence of more stable, more democratic governments has given us responsible partners with whom we can address the full range of regional and international issues; settling or preventing conflicts; combating crime, narcotics, terrorism, and weapons proliferation; protecting and managing the global environment; expanding the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the results thus far have been encouraging, we must recognize that Africa's transformation is ongoing, incomplete, and still tenuous in many places. It would be extremely shortsighted not to persist in the effort to consolidate and protect the investment already made. The problems that would arise if the transformation falters -- failed states, political instability, human tragedy -- would pose direct threats to U.S. interests and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Involvement in Africa is paying Off: Nowhere are the benefits of active U.S. involvement and investment more evident than in &quot;Southern Africa&quot;. Our efforts at conflict resolution and democratic institution building have paid -- and will continue to pay -- significant dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the establishment of a non-racial democracy in South Africa, U.S.  business can contribute to the country's economic disparities that are the legacy of apartheid. South Africa already accounts for $2.2 billion in trade -- nearly half of the U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan Africa. Ford and Pepsi recently made multimillion- dollar investments, and over 300 U.S. firms have returned since mid-1991. AT&amp;T, Citibank, IBM, Kodak,Sara Lee, and Proctor &amp; Gamble are becoming household names. South Africa is the cornerstone of a much larger market, one that encompassed the 11 nations of Southern Africa and their 130 million inhabitants, and extraordinary minerals, wildlife, and resources. The potential of the Southern African sub-region is what has led the Commerce Department to declare it one of the world's ten major reemerging markets for U.S. exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In West Africa, &quot;Ghana&quot; provides another example of how U.S.  involvement and support -- including USAID's Trade and Investment Program -- have yielded impressive results. Our leadership in promoting democratic institutions and economic reforms have turned Ghana into one of our most promising African export markets. Between 1992 and 1993, U.S. exports to Ghana expand by 73 percent. Figures for 1994 trail that performance, but U.S.  businesses have found profitable opportunities, and their products and investments are reinforcing Ghana's development goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Events in &quot;Sierra Leone&quot; offer a cautionary lesson. The recent eruption of civil unrest in this coastal nation illustrates the fragility of some regimes and underscores the need for us to maintain knowledgeable, experienced diplomats in the field who can work to prevent developing conflicts where possible, or help work out solutions. In the particular case of Sierra Leone, the economic stakes are high as well. An attack in January shut down Sierra Rutile, a 50-percent U.S.-owned mine that is the world's largest single producer of rutile, a strategic titanium ore used in aircraft manufacture and paints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Support for Africa is an Investment in out Future: The African market, with over one-half billion potential consumers, is already significant. There is great potential in sectors such as telecommunications, finance, agriculture, and natural resources, although obstacles to trade and investment remain in a number of countries. The U.S. direct investment position approaches $3.5 billion. In 1993, U.S. firms exported nearly $4.8 billion in goods and services to Sub-Saharan Africa. This is 20 percent greater that our exports to the Commonwealth of Independent States of the former Soviet Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These exports represent tangible benefits to American families. By some estimates, every extra $1 billion in exports adds 19,000 new jobs in the United States. Doubling our exports to Africa could create an additional increase, provided that the political and economic transformation currently underway is sustained. Given the potential gains to the United States, our current development aid to Africa -- about one-half of one-tenth of one percent of the federal budget -- represents a minuscule investment with the possibility of a tremendous pay-off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent speech, AID administrator Brian Atwood offered a quick, back-of- the-envelope calculation to illustrate this point. Using simple, but not implausible, assumptions about African demand for foreign goods, U.S.  market share, and U.S. population growth, he came to the following conclusion: The average $3 per year that each American family contributes to African development assistance, if sustained over 30 years, could generate an annual $600 in exports per U.S. family by the year 2025. As Brian points out, these are not trivial amounts; they represent millions of jobs for out children, and financial interest to remain engaged in Africa and to support real, but fragile, economic and political transformation that has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other Policy Initiatives Will Spur Trade with Africa: This Administration has also vigorously pursued global trade, investment, and debt policy initiatives that will boost U.S.-Africa business and commercial ties and help integrate Africa into the world economy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade: The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations and the creation of the World Trade Organization will enhance trade opportunities with African countries. The U.S. Trade Representative is chairing a working group to formulate and implement a comprehensive trade and development policy to ensure that these countries are able to take full advantage of the opportunities to compete successfully in growing regional and global markets as trade barriers come down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investment: On multiple fronts we are pursuing our goals of open markets, non- discriminatory treatment, and basic fairness for U.S. investors doing business abroad -- be it in Europe, East Asia,or Africa. Where appropriate, we negotiate Bilateral Investment Treaties that protect investors from expropriations and assure the right to transfer funds and access to fair dispute resolution mechanisms. Debt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief: The United States and other creditor nations have established a mechanism in the Paris Club to offer debt reduction on a selective, case-by-case basis to countries that are undertaking economic reforms, but that are still saddled with heavy debt burdens that inhibit private investment and growth. Some two dozen low- income African countries have benefited from debt reschedulings or reductions over the past several years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We Provide Direct Support for U.S. business in Africa: I have outlined how our policies and programs that promote democracy, peace, and sustainable development in Africa reinforce U.S. economic interests and provide significant indirect benefits and opportunities for the U.S. private sector.  But we are also actively involved in providing direct support services and assistance to the business community. Deputy Assistant Secretary Walker is providing a detailed overview. Let me just provide a few recent examples of the role our embassies are playing: In Ethiopia, our embassy helped Louisiana-based Schaffer and Associates in a hard-fought and successful bid for an $84 million sugar project, with prospects for an additional $50 million in sales of related U.S. goods and services. In Botswana, the U.S. Ambassador's intervention resulted in removal of discriminatory tender requirements that hampered an Owens-Corning bid on a $180 million contract to supply pipes for a major water pipeline. In Kenya, Zimbabwe, Malawi and Mauritius, our embassies actively supported the Kellogg Company's effort to reduce import duties on breakfast cereal. In Madagascar, our Ambassador's efforts to ensure a level playing field for all bidders resulted in the signing of a lease/purchase agreement for a Boeing 737 aircraft. In Cameroon and Chad, our embassies supported negotiations leading to a recent $3-4 billion agreement relating to the building of a proposed oil pipeline from land- locked Chad, through Cameroon, to an offshore terminal.  The consortium which is to build the pipeline is led by an affiliate of Exxon. In Zimbabwe, the tender offer for the country's first cellular phone system was canceled after our Ambassador protested that the specifications were biased in favor of European suppliers. Several U.S. firms were able to submit bids after the tender was rewritten. In Senegal, the U.S. envoy successfully persuaded the authorities to replace outdated health legislation that prevented Colgate from making or selling fluoride toothpaste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are Creating New Government-Business Partnerships: Providing information on economic trends, local business practices, and financing options; ensuring a level playing field; removing discriminatory regulations -- this is the kind of work that our embassies in Africa and our personnel in Washington do every day to help U.S. businesses, large and small, to find opportunities in Africa. In an increasingly tight budget environment, we need to find ways to be more efficient and more effective in our business facilitation efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have ongoing contacts with a variety of Africa-related business groups, such as the U.S.-Angola Chamber of Commerce, the U.S.-South Africa Business Council, and the African Business Roundtable. We also have frequent exchanges with the Corporate Council on Africa. These are the kinds of partnerships between business and government that we value and wish to strengthen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few months ago, the Corporate Council on Africa, the Department of State, the other federal agencies held a series of roundtable discussions, and found many of the recommendations that ensued to be useful and timely.  Some of the issues the Corporate Council raised -- the need to remain engaged throughout Africa, the need to support regional economic integration, the need to secure broader international adherence to the principles of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the need to re- invent the role of our embassy economic officers -- are issues we are already in the process of addressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other Corporate Council recommendations touched on complex issues that require careful analysis. The availability of government-supported export financing, for example, is a central concern; but it is a difficult issue, given that current practice is rooted in the provisions of the Credit Reform Act and the charter legislation for eximbank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. I have asked Regina C. Brown, our Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic and Business Affairs, to chair an informal interagency review of the Council's recommendations, with the aim of identifying concrete, feasible steps the Administration can take to address the concerns that have been raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Needs to Remain Engaged: To recapitulate, Madam Chairman, Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing a sweeping political and economic transformation. Democratic institutions are being developed or strengthened in numerous countries, and fledgling governments are taking important steps to liberalize their economies and create an enabling environment for private sector-led growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. leadership and support have been critical to this transformation.  Already, our active engagement in this process is starting to show results.  Our assistance programs fostering democratization and economic reform have created opportunities for U.S. business. U.S. exporters and investors, in turn, have reinforced development goals in African nations. All Americans potentially stand to gain from the expansion of African markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must recognize, however, that Africa's new governments are fragile and their transformation remains incomplete. We need to continue supporting their efforts. Our initiatives to strengthen democracy, resolve conflicts, and foster sustainable development in Africa representing a low-cost investment. If we as a nation remain engaged, American businesses -- and indeed all of us -- can expect to reap significant returns.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hearing on Trade and Investment in Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 16,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just a few weeks ago, a constituent of mine, Mr. Owen Williams of Durham, traveled to Uganda. His trip came as a result of a meeting last year with a visiting Ugandan trade delegation to the United States. During his trip, Mr. Williams met with several Ugandan ministries and private business people on behalf of furniture and building material firms in North Carolina.  He said that the trip went very well, and he looks forward to pursuing the mutual interests he found in Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Owen Williams is just one small example of the kind of private sector initiative that, over the long haul, yields the foundation for mature economic relations between nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten or fifteen years ago, I guarantee you that Owen Williams would not have been looking for business in Uganda. It wouldn't have occurred to him.  Uganda and a few other African countries have made tremendous strides in recent years in opening up their economies, taking down barriers to trade, reducing corruption and generally bringing their countries into the mainstream of international commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They should be commended, and the United States should support their efforts. It is those efforts that will allow a growing relationship between our countries, one based on respect and mutual benefit, to emerge. A relationship based on one party giving financial assistance to another is neither sustainable nor respectful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I commend Senators Kassebaum and Feingold for holding the first Africa Subcommittee hearing of the 104th Congress--indeed, it is the first subcommittee hearing of any kind--on trade and investment. It sends a clear signal to the business community that some parts of the government, at least, care about their concerns. It also sends a signal to the governments of the countries of Africa, where some progress is being made but much more needs doing, that good and active relations with the United States will depend much upon their policies. And finally, it sends a signal to the people of Africa, who deserve to find their governments what we too often take for granted: accountability, rational policies, and adherence to the rule of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Dr. Dorothy I. Height</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the President of the National Council of Negro Women, Incorporated, (NCNW), I, Dorothy Height, am pleased to join my dear friends and fellow colleagues, Ambassador Andrew Young, Congressman Donald Payne, C. Payne Lucas, President and CEO of Africare and the hundreds of organizations and interested parties that have come together today to speak up and speak out about the immediate need to defend U.S. AID to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AID to Africa is and must be advocated as a viable investment made by America to ensure the continuance of the spread of global democratization, and the strengthening of social and economic development on the continent of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Founded in 1935, The National Council of Negro Women has worked diligently to foster programs, technical and educational support to women of color domestically and internationally. As a non-governmental organization, we have worked in partnership with the U.S. Government to help African women and men develop programs and initiatives in Africa to improve the overall quality of life and to build viable relationships between Africans and Americans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For over 60 years we have learned first-hand and have worked day-to-day with African women and children which has resulted in the development of strong global leadership establishing the international agenda for women in such issues as maternal and child health; nutrition; maintaining the institution of family; and creating business opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through the decades, African women have provided leadership to people throughout the world in an effort to uplift the conditions of the poor.  Enhanced global communications between Africa and America allows us to see the relatedness of global concerns of everyday life. We know that the problem of poverty are not only serious in the developing world but are problems that are equally faced domestically in the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As America in a bi-partisan spirit, evaluates and explores viable business markets, it is in the enlightened self-interest of the United States to cultivate and increase support for Africa. African-Americans have an historical and moral obligation to champion this issue. Representing four million African-American women and women of color today, I call upon President Clinton, the Republican and Democratic leadership of the U.S.  Congress, to renew the confidence and commitment of America to providing equitable levels of AID and support to Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Brian Atwood</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am pleased to be with you today as President Clinton's representative. I understand that the president has issued a statement that was shared with you. As you heard, it underscores the abiding commitment of this Administration to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From time to time American ballot boxes produce what we called revolutions. We know about the revolution sparked by the Voting Rights Act.  Franklin Roosevelt's election created a revolution. So did Ronald Reagan's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are in the early stages of a revolution in Washington today. And, as in every other time in our history, good can emerge from the changes their revolution brings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congressional reform -- the streamlining of the institution, the increased transparency, open rules -- this is all long overdue. A Gore-Gingrich collaboration to reinvent government is something the American people welcome. This is not politics-as-usual, and it can produce positive change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the fervor that accompanies the early stages of a revolution, incautious positions are often asserted. At the least, before such positions become the accepted wisdom, someone must challenge them, civilly, but forcefully. That is the only way we can keep revolution on a healthy course.  Indeed, that is the way mandates for change are interpreted and given real meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A case in point is the assertion that we have no national interests in Africa. That we must reduce or eliminate development assistance to that continent, That Africa has neither geopolitical importance for the United States nor economic value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With all the force we can muster, we say: That is just plain wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let's examine the question objectively. For just a moment, let's leave out America's humanitarian values. Let's put aside our historic ties to Africa. Let's forget sentimentality. Instead, let's talk about hard economic facts and markets and sales. Let's ask ourselves: is Africa worth the investment? Is a continent of half a billion people worth one-half of one-tenth of one percent of the federal budget, which is what we now spend on it? Is the three dollars and change that each American family pays each year to help several dozen sub-Saharan nations a burden worth the price?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course it is. It's a good deal for America. It's a good investment for Americans. Our aid to Africa is not welfare, nor is it charity. It is an investment we make in other people for our own self-interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How we do build markets? The answer is simple: we do it by making investments for the future. That is what vision is all about. That is what practical reality teaches us too. If we want to talk economic rationales, then we must look at Africa as the last great developing market. We must look at it the way we looked at Latin America and Asia a generation ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider Latin America; today it is fastest growing market for American goods. This is a huge new middle class market of 350 million people.  It got that way because of investments made during the last forty years -- $30.7 billion in economic assistance from the United States between 1949 and 1993. Yet our exports to all of Latin American in 1993 alone were more than two-and-a-half times that amount -- $78 billion. Quite a payoff in jobs and income, and that was just one year. And the Latin American market is likely to grow three times larger in the next decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where would we be if John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon had not committed themselves to the Alliance for Progress and the education programs that helped create a generation of economists and technicians who now lead South America's impressive growth? What kind of customers would we have if we had not supported health and education programs that invested in the human capital of Latin America, an investment that now is producing an educated, healthy workforce that can afford to buy our goods and services?  What kind of stability would we have in this market if we had not supported democracy-building programs that have made military juntas and coups a thing of the past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is an interesting exercise to compare sub-Saharan Africa today to three of the newest &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; -- Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand -- as they were in 1960: African per capita income is today 80% of what it was in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand 35 years ago. But Africa today has four times the number of people Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand had in 1960. Think of the potential of this African market, even at its current stage of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bottom line is that Africa today is not significantly behind where the &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; were in 1960. In the three decades since, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand substantially reduced poverty, their rates of population growth, infant mortality, and illiteracy. These countries are now major players in the world economy. We believe Africa can do as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The doubters should look not just at Africa's potential; the market is already significant, and like other developing markets, it is growing far faster than our markets in Europe. In 1992, sub-Saharan Africa imported $63 billion worth of merchandise from the world. African imports have risen by around 7.0% per year for the past decade. At this rate, the African market would amount to $480 billion by the year 2025. That is approximately $267 billion in today's dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. currently accounts for nearly 10% of the African market. Do the arithmetic. Each American family now spends about $3 annually on aid to Africa. At current growth rates, that will produce something like $50 billion worth of American exports to Africa each year in 30 years. In 2025, the U.S.  is projected to have a population of 320 million. Again, do the arithmetic.  $50 billion worth of exports would work out to about $600 worth of exports per family, annually, in 2025. And that is if Africa's growth remains at its current level; if we make the investments Africa needs, and if African nations implement the kind of policies that have benefited Asia and Latin America, the return for each American family in thirty years could be as much as $2000 per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are not trivial amounts. They represent millions of jobs for our children, financial health for our nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Isn't Africa worth the investment now that we made in Asia and Latin America? Those who argue against such investments are shortchanging the next generation of Americans. There is, of course, no guarantee that our investments will pay dividends, but it is as good a bet as most mutual funds, Moreover, the cost of not acting could overwhelm our treasury, and, I fear, our consciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who say we have no strategic interest in Africa should understand that if African nations fail to make progress, if they descend into chaos and decay, the tragedy will not take place in a vacuum. Chaos there will affect our interests here. As long as we remain true to our values -- and there is a strong bipartisan consensus that suggests we will (even Pat Buchanan supports disaster relief) -- the costs of humanitarian operations will continue to be borne in part by the United States. If more African nations fail, we will share the costs of caring for the millions of refugees.  We will shoulder the burdens of dealing with endless famine. And we will have to confront the spreading political disorder, the environmental damage, and the consequent loss of markets for our goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parts of Africa are living on the edge. Many African nations face adverse climatic and soil conditions. Each day, people in these countries face problems of poor health and malnutrition and illiteracy that few other peoples confront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet lost in the apocalyptic descriptions of an Africa seemingly falling apart is genuine reason for encouragement. The headlines rarely report the many positive developments and success stories in Africa. Yet in a number of African nations, democratically-elected, enlightened leaders, committed to broadening participation and undertaking reforms necessary for development, are creating an environment for success. This, too, is the reality of Africa:.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> USAID today is working in 35 African nations that, in our judgment, are in various phases of consolidating their democracies, creating free markets, and implementing serious economic reforms. Conversely, we have ended our involvement in several nations where the governments refuse to commit themselves to reform or to a development partnership with their own citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new generation of African leaders is pursuing extensive economic restructuring programs, including privatization of state-owned enterprise, reducing government functions and budgets, stabilizing the economy, and implementing policy change that help the private sector expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New crops and market liberalization are expanding food production, raising farmer income and reducing food prices for consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More children, especially girls, are attending school so that they can become more productive members of society. And we know from our own experience that more than any other factor, improving the education of girls and the status of women enhances the economy, the environment, and the prospects of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Programs to expand immunization and use of oral rehydration therapy are saving an estimated 800,000 African children each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fertility is starting to fall as more and more parents use family planning services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am proud that USAID has played a role in one of these achievements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every Rwanda there is a Ghana -- a nation that has begun revitalizing its economy and is intent on being part of the worldwide economic expansions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every Somalia, there is a South Africa or a Namibia -- nations that have successfully implemented democracy and peaceful change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every Angola, there is a Mozambique, emerging now from civil conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For every tragedy, there are a half dozen islands of hope. Progress is still tentative, often fragile. Which is precisely why we must not hesitate now. But this continent is no write-off. It is a good investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have learned from the mistakes we made during the Cold War. We now are concentrating our aid in countries that are implementing sound economic policies, promoting an open and democratic society, and investing their own resources in broad-based development. That is exactly what the Congress wanted to accomplish with the Development Fund for Africa. And that is why this Administration strongly supports the Development Fund for Africa. Under this fund, we have taken a longer- term approach to Africa's development, systematically addressing the root causes -- economic, social, and political -- of underdevelopment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In those countries stricken with disaster or famine, we are treating emergency relief as more than an end in itself. Rather, we are structuring it to help nations make the difficult transition from crisis to the path of sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton's Initiative for the Greater Horn of Africa is designed to apply the lessons we learned in the Sahel and Southern Africa to a troubled region that now consumes nearly half of all African relief. By emphasizing regional cooperation and planning, by helping nations acquire the ability to respond to food crises early on, we can prevent droughts from becoming famines. This Initiative, we believe, will save lives and resources.  The partnerships it builds will enable the donor community to save billions of dollars in relief assistance over the next fifteen years and focus resources instead on recovery efforts and long-term development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To prevent more failed nations, the United States must strengthen our efforts to prevent crisis and to encourage others to do so as well. While we only provide five percent of the development assistance that Africa receives, we provide 30 percent of the relief assistance directed at the continent's emergencies. It is a lot less expensive to lead the way on prevention than it is to pay the costs of failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am able to make the case for assistance to Africa today because USAID has reorganized itself to be an effective instrument of development.  Many of our reforms were pioneered by the Development Fund for Africa. The DFA forced us to measure results and now we are going to do this everywhere.  Our work in Africa has been an essential part of our identity, and must remain so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So now we have a fight on our hands. We welcome it. If the revolution has indeed begun, then each of us must do everything we can to ensure that the well- being of our children -- and the children of Africa -- is advanced by the vision today's revolution produces. We cannot be silent. We cannot wring our hands. The case for Africa gives us the opportunity to be the champions of common sense. This is a battle well worth waging. Not for African Americans, not for historical reasons, not even for our humanitarian values, though we must never forget them. This is a battle worth waging for America's national interests and the future of our children. We will wage it.  And I am confident that, in end, common sense will prevail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speech to Summit on Africa Aid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Donald M. Payne</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good afternoon, I want to commend the Constituency for Africa (CFA) for initiating this meeting at this crucial time for Africa. There have been three periods in recent Africa history that have bearing on changing the course of events for Africa. First, the independence era in the early 1960's when the continent was freed of their colonial masters, and leaving them without adequate resources and preparation for their new freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, during the cold war, when Africa was used and abused. Used by both the Soviet Union and the United States to fight hot wars on African soil. The most symbolic were in Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, and you know there were others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abused, because we ignored humanitarian principles, and turned our eyes away from corruption and human rights abuses when it seemed in the interest of winning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also was obvious that preferential rehabilitation assistance was needed to right wrongs, but our voices were not heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, indexes or the quality of life in the continent have spiraled down in the last two decades, at the some time going up in other parts of the developing world. Many, like Vice President Gore, who read the Kaplan Article in Atlantic Monthly were appalled at the condition of Africa, and determined to assist the continent. Unfortunately, others doubted Africa was even salvageable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We really were not very good teachers in preparing Africa for out grand plans of multi-party democracies and free markets economies to be operated free of corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are now a few years into the Third Period, which I would call the post cold war period. Armed conflict continues to afflict sub-Saharan Africa where fighting persists in Sudan, Liberia, and Sierra Leon --- and we have our fingers crossed on Angola, despite the cease fire agreement. The potential for renewed outbreaks in Rwanda, Burundi, and Somalia is high, and other countries like Zaire and Nigeria are at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Human rights problems have been accelerated due to overpopulation and lack of sustainable development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, all is not gloom and doom. There have been historic advances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Ghana, and other countries we could name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The respected Africanist, Ambassador Elliot Skinner at a recent meeting hosted by Carnegie, &quot;we need to note and promote Africa's rich natural resources and our economic interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My esteemed former congressional colleague, the Honorable Mervyn Dymally, also said at the same meeting that economic advances in Africa should have preceded the emphasis on democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are thoughtful statements and deserve more consideration, as I know Andy Young will provide will today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as I understand my job today, is to provide with some insights on what's happening on capital hill, how serious it is and what's being done about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are all aware of Republican Senator McConnel initiative to eliminate the ear mark on Development Funds for Africa. This smacks right at the core of the historic Congressional Black Caucus efforts to reverse the inequalities of the past contribution of Ron Dellums in sponsoring the Anti-Apartheid Act which mobilized American against racial discrimination in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Remember the late Mickey Leland, who gave his very life in pursuit of increasing the awareness of all Americans to the plights of our African brothers and sisters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have a proud heritage, and in no way are we going to go backward.  We will use every resource at our disposal to win this fight!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of you know that for the last two terms the leadership, both Democrat and Republican, have tried to abolish the Subcommittee on Africa.  Our present Congressional Black Caucus leadership has been successful, with your help, in preserving this important committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Republicans were faced with reducing seven subcommittees to 5, verses the Democrats mandate to reduce from 8 to 6 in the last term of congress. Speaker Gingrich was most sympathetic to our cause, as was the new International Relations Committee Chairman Gilman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanry Hyde the powerful conservative Republican leader also helped to make the case for our continuation. Actually, we had an easier time with the Republicans this term that with the Democrats last term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This leads me to emphasize that we should not make aid to Africa a partisan issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many Republicans on the Senate side like Nancy Kassebaum, Chair of the Senate Africa Affairs Committee, James Jeffords and Paul Coverdell (former Peace Corps Director) who I personally know have Africa's interest in their heart. Sen. Jesse Helms also has not been too impress with the McConnell initiative and may help pass the first authorizing bill on foreign aid in years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have been further informed by top leaders in the Jewish Community that they stand ready to fight for the preservation of out earmark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us not forget the close relationship we have had over many years with our Jewish friends on a grass root community level in fighting for social justice. We feel this same partnership could be positively expressed on the international level, and not have this issue create division. An important specific announcement on this will be forthcoming in the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another action by Caucus members was our quick response in fighting for the autonomy of the Agency for the International Development. As if we did not have enough problems, the Administration started to tinker with the idea of merging it into the State Department. Especially, after we finally have a strong enough leader in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brian Atwood, and right on the tail of his own efforts to fine tune his new reorganization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our letter to the White House Chief of Staff, Leon Panetta, with a copy to Vice President Gore, said in effect &quot;the merging with the State Department would further put DFA funds in jeopardy and would directly feed into the McConnell Bill and thereby alienate the African Americans. Further, this continues to cast our foreign policy in disarray, and indicates to the public that the Administration has doubts about its own method of operation.  We implore you to ask the President to speak out on this matter at once.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He did -- through Vice President Gore's statement a few days later where he ruled against the merger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, indirectly at risk were the African Development Foundation and the National Endowment for Democracy, which are doing effective work with small grass root development and human rights groups in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to our efforts to preserve the 802 million dollar FY 1995 earmark for Africa in light of an estimated 20% total foreign aid cut, we need to be aware of larger sums appropriated for IDA (International Development Association), the soft loan window of the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approximately 45% of IDA lending is targeted to sub-Saharan Africa.  This year the Administration will request an appropriation to IDA of $1.250 billion. Since $617 million of last year's money has not yet been expended, and if one adds the possibility of a recession, we are talking about the vulnerability of loosing $1.867 billion of which about half would have gone to Africa. Since these funds are matched 4 to 1 by other nations these potential actions could encourage them to also cut back causing a loss of billions of dollars for Africa. We must give more attention to the World Bank and other multi-lateral institutions like the African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems to me that the Constituency for Africa's role is to broaden the public's understanding of what is at stake. Congress will not pass legislation where there is not a constituent support. Calls and letters need to be directed to each constituents local Representative and Senator. If all the calls come to the CBC, we dilute the effect of our movement. There is too much effort inside the Beltway and not outside the Beltway. Reach out to local chapters of NAACP, Black Churches -- all Churches, Temples and Mosques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the way, I think it is great, the support CFA is receiving from our Muslim brothers and sisters to finance this meeting today. Their attendance is also evidence that we are united together for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, there are influential members of congress who have close ties with the NGO community like I have had with the YMCA, U.S. Committee for UNICEF and UNA. Senator Hatfield with World Vision, one of America's largest Non Governmental Organizations in overseas development and relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In closing I would like to read from a letter I recently received from Robert A. Seiple, President of World Vision, one of America's largest Non-Governmental Organizations in overseas development and relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Seiple writes, &quot;Our national net worth, like an individual's, will ultimately be determined not by what we selfishly keep but rather what we compassionately and responsibly give away. No global power can truly be great whose national interest excludes human dignity and the sanctity of every human life. Not to be an impact player in a world of desperation is nothing short of a betrayal of our Christian ethics. This world and its people matter to God, and we turn away from them at our peril.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you, and stay the course on aid to Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 3,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I welcome the initiative of so many distinguished Americans and organization who have come together today in Washington to send a simple message: Africa matters to the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa matters because of the huge potential of its people and its economies, potential that already creates jobs and exports for our nation. It matters because of the historic ties that bind our peoples, including the roots of 25 million African Americans. And it matters because the great global challenges of tomorrow -- promoting sustainable development, protecting human rights, stopping environmental decline, ensuring reasonable population growth, preemption ethnic tensions, and integrating the rich spiritual heritage of Islam into the demands of modern states -- can be seen in the challenges facing Africa today.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My Administration has acted to promote these important national interests. we have worked to advance the remarkable transition to democracy, and economic development throughout southern Africa. We have helped resolve conflicts throughout the continent, such as efforts to bring an end to two decades of terrible civil war in Mozambique and Angola. Under the innovative leadership of USAID Administrator Brian Atwood, we have launched a new initiative in the greater Horn of Africa to anticipate and address the causes of potential famine that threatens 25 million people. We have helped relieve the crushing burden of debt for many African nations. And we have responded to humanitarian crises in Rwanda, Liberia, Angola, Sudan, and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a new spirit of democracy and self-reliance throughout Africa. I have felt it in the meetings I have held with eight African Heads of State in the past year. And the Vice President, U.N. Ambassador Madeline Albright, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott have all felt it as well during their recent trips crisscrossing the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We all know that we are facing a tough new budget environment, and we are going through a healthy process of assigning clear priorities and demanding efficiency for government resources. Let me assure you that in the budget I am submitting to Congress, I am committed to ensuring adequate resources for meeting the challenges and seizing the opportunities we face in Africa. Thank you again for your efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the Constituency for Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 3, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Aid in Context</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate over the utility and effectiveness of American foreign aid has been a mainstay of American politics for the last fifty years. The foreign aid program began in 1946 when President Truman offered assistance to post World War II Europe in conjunction with the Marshall Plan European reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the Cold War, foreign aid, though unpopular was seen as a necessary tool to promote America's national interest and foreign policy goals. Foreign assistance was directly related to the overarching policy objective of containing Soviet influence and the expansion of Communism throughout the world, particularly in Third World or developing countries.  Those countries that fit into this strategic and geopolitical scheme became America's new allies and were rewarded with military and development aid. Of the $436 billion spent on foreign aid since 1946, two-thirds has been in military assistance, with the balance spent on humanitarian, development, and emergency relief programs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the end of the Cold War, American policy-makers began to re-examine the underlying foundation and rationale for foreign aid program no longer applied to an American foreign policy, and world, in flux. Although developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and United States, their development, humanitarian, and emergency relief needs continued to grow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The breakup of the Soviet Union ushered in a &quot;new world order&quot; comprised of post-Soviet successor states in Central and Eastern Europe seeking new political and economic systems. American policy-makers have supported the acceptance of democracy and capitalism in these states by providing massive amounts of foreign aid. Thus, the Newly-Independent (NIS) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)(in addition to the Middle East) are the regions in which American resources and priorities increasingly have been focused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Foreign Aid Regime: Immediately after the November 1994 Congressional elections brought both the House and Senate under Republican majorities, leaders in Congress began discussions on reducing foreign aid.  Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is a documented critic of the present foreign aid system. Helms has called foreign aid an ineffective giveaway and has promised to intrude a foreign aid bill that not only will reduce foreign aid, but will impose tougher standards on foreign aid recipients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To date, the Helms foreign aid bill has not been introduced. Upon its introduction, the Helms bill likely will become the primary legislative vehicle for the debate on foreign aid reform. Because it is authorizing legislation, the Helms bill would be considered first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, announced that he would introduce legislation to revise America's foreign aid system. Calling the current foreign aid process outdated and inefficient McConnell's proposal establishes three goals for American foreign aid: 1) Foreign aid must protect American security interests; 2) Foreign aid must promote American economic interests; 3) Foreign aid must preserve political and regional stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other things, the McConnell proposal would increase foreign aid to the former Soviet republics, increase foreign aid to the Camp David countries (Israel and Egypt), and reduce or eliminate altogether several government agencies currently responsible for foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The McConnell bill has not yet been introduced. As an appropriations bill, the McConnell legislation would be limited by the authorizations and policies contained in the Helms legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assault on Aid to Africa: Both Senator Helms and Senator McConnell are on record opposing the existing levels of foreign aid for Africa. Both have promised to scale back bilateral aid to Africa considerably, perhaps by as much as 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most troubling, the McConnell proposal would abolish protected funding (or earmarking) for the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) along with earmarks for the African Development Bank and the African Development Foundation.  McConnell's proposal would reduce overall foreign aid to Africa by as much as 30%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> McConnell has stated: &quot;(T)he continent of Africa has had a sort of perpetual earmark of about $800 million. I don't think there ought to be an earmark for them or for any other part of the world where we do not have a clear national security interest. There would be a residual pool of funds, up to $3 billion unearmarked, that countries in Africa and countries outside of Africa that have basically made no progress could still compete for, but I would want to target that assistance in a way that guaranteed some results.  And we know we're going to get results when we try to encourage the spread of capitalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Helms and McConnell pursue their plans, new foreign aid legislation would substantially isolate Africa the bulk of available foreign aid funds in the federal budget and force African countries that receive foreign aid to compete with other regions of the world for a diminished share of foreign assistance. Such a system establishes a road map for failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Protecting the Development Fund for Africa: The Development Fund for Africa (DFA) was proposed in 1987 following Congressional recognition that Africa was consistently left to survive from the crumbs of the larger foreign aid loaf while aid to other regions was insulated or protected by earmarks.  Prior to the establishment of the DFA, foreign aid appropriations for Africa were vulnerable to plunder from any Member of Congress who could make a plausible or persuasive case for any other region or purpose. Owing to the leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus, this practice was stopped when the DFA was initiated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Originally appropriated at $500 million, the DFA provided the Agency for International Development (AID) with a consistent way to meet long-term development and foreign policy objectives and an assured and stable source of funding for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DFA emphasized the following policies in the American foreign aid program to Africa: (1) Concentrating DFA resources in selected African countries that demonstrated a willingness to undertake economic policy reforms and structural adjustment; (2) Focusing on critical sectors within those countries; (3) Encouraging African governmental reform while continuing to provide assistance for needed projects; (4) Addressing the social and environmental effects of development; (5) Integrating food aid with development assistance; and (6) Cooperating with host government agencies, bilateral and multilateral donors, and non governmental organizations involved in development assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DFA Has Been Successful:By almost every account, the Development Fund for Africa has been successful in providing bilateral development assistance to Africa. In a 1991 Report to the House Appropriation Committee (GAO Report), the Government Accounting Office (GAO) found that the DFA was being implemented consistent with congressional guidance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GAO Report made the following conclusions: (1) The DFA was concentrating its resources (appropriately) in countries that had adopted policy reforms to support economic growth. (2) DFA resources were concentrated in specific sectors that were determined to be essential to the recipient country's development success. (3) The DFA allowed recipient countries to maximize the utilization of other bilateral and multilateral assistance, particularly with respect to food aid, agricultural development and micro-enterprise development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How Much Foreign Aid Does Africa Receive: There is a prevailing and erroneous perception that Africa receives an enormous amount of American foreign aid. This misperception has been exacerbated by a number of factors, including the following: (1) Abuse of American foreign aid by some African governments; (2) Africa's continued economic and political problems; and (3) American foreign aid to address natural disasters, emergencies, and large humanitarian relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American interventions in Somalia and relief assistance to Rwanda have been costly, but together, this aid does not measure up to the assistance the U.S. has provided to the former Soviet Republics, or to the Camp David countries in any one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 19941995, U.S. aid to Africa breaks down as follows: (1) Development Fund for Africa will be $802 million; (2) African Development Fund/Bank will be $124 million; (3) African Development Foundation will be $16 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African Aid Context: (1) American foreign aid totaled $13.8 billion in 1994. This represents less than 1 percent of the total United States budget of $1.5 trillion. (2) Aid to Africa represents 6 percent of the foreign aid budget and a meager .053 percent of the total United States budget. (3) America's contribution to foreign aid, as measured in percentage of GDP, is very little. Among Western countries, for example, the U.S. contributes only 0.20% of its GDP. This ranks far behind Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Scandinavia countries and the United Kingdom, in some cases by as much as 100 per cent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why Africa Should Matter to the United States:There are many who argue that with the end of the Cold War, Africa no longer has strategic importance to the United States. Others seek to marginalize Africa's importance to America in terms of its fledgling economies and burdensome debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These views reflect an incomplete appreciation of the range of issues vital to the long-term economic and security interests of the United States, however defined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In summary form, they are: Trade: Although the volume of trade between the United States and Africa is modest, much of it consists of commodities of vital importance to U.S. security -- high grade petroleum, platinum, titanium, chromium and other minerals, to which continued access is vital.  Africa is also increasing its share of American exports, providing jobs and income for American taxpayers.  Democracy: Democracy and market-oriented economies are on the rise in Africa.  Without foreign assistance, fragile economies will be unable to develop democratically. Societies mired in perpetual poverty are highly susceptible to seeking growth and development through authoritarian leadership with a high probability of such states becoming hostile to U.S. interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conclusion: Despite the many known failures of the foreign aid system, bilateral foreign aid and contributions to multilateral assistance efforts serve a valuable function, particularly in Africa. These programs constitute an infinitesimal portion of the total U.S. budget. Aid to Africa is slightly more than 1/2 of 1 percent of the U.S. budget and only 6 percent of American foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Scaling back American aid to Africa sends the wrong signal to African governments and economies struggling to recover from the effects of colonialism and Cold War. If the United States acknowledges any leadership role in the world, it is in its interest as sole superpower to support African successes and, correctly, look critically on the failures.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Summit on Africa Aid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 3, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Constituency for Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- In what is clearly intended as a show of force, two African-American leaders, Andy Young and Donald Payne, have orchestrated a massive coalition of organizations to meet on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C. on Friday, February 3. Their objective is to fight what they see as ominous moves in the 104th Republican-led Congress to eliminate U.S. economic assistance to Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young -- who was a top aide to Martin Luther King, served as Jimmy Carter's unusually influential Ambassador to the UN, and ran Atlanta for two terms as Mayor -- currently plays two formal roles in U.S. policy toward Africa. First in October he was appointed by President Clinton to manage a $100 million fund dedicated to reconstructing post-apartheid South Africa and its neighbors. Second, he now heads the Board of the Constituency for Africa, CFA, a network of organizations and individuals whose aim is to generate support for better US policy toward Africa. CFA is doing the organizing legwork needed to pull off the February 3 meeting on Capitol Hill</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Don Payne, who represents Newark, is the first African-American from New Jersey to be elected to the House of Representatives. He was recently selected by his peers to head the Congressional Black Caucus, CBC. One of the longest serving members on the Africa subcommittee of the House panel that oversees America's international relations, Payne is considered a leading House lawmaker on Africa issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dubbing their effort, &quot;Summit on Africa Aid,&quot; Young and Payne have invited a virtual who-is-who of American civic organizations as well as some major businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included are: The Carter Center; US-South Africa Airways; NAACP; International Republican Institute; General Motors Corporation; Global Coalition for Africa; TransAfrica; the African-American Institute; the Aspen Institute; AT &amp; T; and Coca Cola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their joint invitation letter, Payne and Young took particular issue with selected provisions in a bill announced on December 12 by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky who recently took over leadership of the foreign operations subcommittee of the Senate's Appropriations Committee. In that position, McConnell will wield enormous influence over levels of foreign aid approved by the Senate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For organizers of the Feb. 3 meeting, two pieces in the McConnell bill are particularly vexing. The first would abolish ADF, the African Development Foundation. This independent federal agency is tiny: the most money it ever has ever been allocated for a whole year is $16.9 million -- far less than the $31.7 million that the Pentagon spent each hour of 1994. ADF operates by circumventing African governments and by directly helping the poorest of poor Africans to build wells, to build schools, and to start small businesses. The second threat is McConnell's provision to remove earmarks (read, protection) from the Development Fund for Africa, DFA. The inevitable result, all objective analysts agree, would be to end U.S. aid to Africa as we know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sharp contrast to squeezing Africa, McConnell would open the floodgates of US aid to Ukraine, Poland, Estonia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Critics point out that these are mostly European countries and all used to be behind the iron curtain -- meaning a few short years ago, they were America's communist archenemies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those in the know expect the Young-Payne group to use two complementary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">arguments to make its case: the first will attempt to show the concrete ways in which foreign aid benefits America. The second argument will reason that zeroing sub-Saharan Africa out American foreign aid would be both unfair and shortsighted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To most observers, the Young-Payne group has set itself a formidable task -- particularly in the current Congressional climate of budget slashing in which programs that benefit even the most vulnerable American citizens (e.g. welfare for single mothers, public broadcasting programs or children, etc.) are under attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The betting is that in such an atmosphere, foreign aid does not have a prayer of escaping the budget ax. Even in the best of times in U.S. domestic politics, foreign assistance has long remained an unloved stepchild among federal budgetary programs. Few politicians defend it, even in private. And those who reluctantly vote for it are never anxious to advertise that fact.  Probably, for good political reason polls show that the American public thinks that 20 cents out of every federal dollar goes to foreign aid (the truth is less than one cent!).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, there is the question dreaded by foreign aid proponents: Why should we Americans give our scarce dollars to foreigners when we have so many problems at home and are tightening our own belts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid proponents find this situation frustrating. In their view, the truth surrounding foreign assistance is very different. First, the proportion of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid is tiny. Second and more important, they assert that foreign aid is a bargain and is an efficient tool for promoting the American interest abroad -- more efficient they assert, than such alternative as covert action or military force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, Africa's friends argue that other criteria besides McConnell's -- e.g. aid recipients' need; elimination of poverty; humanitarian concerns; and the desires of 40 million African-Americans -- should be considered in dividing the American aid pie. Clearly, use of such criteria would put Africa in a strong position to continue receiving American aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The skeptics doubt that these arguments will be effective enough to turn the Congressional tide in favor of both foreign aid in general, and assistance to Africa in particular. Still, Young, Payne, and the other organizers of the &quot;Summit&quot; express confidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Health Organization (Geneva)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 27, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International organizations are preparing to launch a new campaign in Africa against a strain of river blindness (Onchocerciasis) recently shown by a new study to cause a widespread, maddening itch that often incapacitates its victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We never realized that this 'forest' strain could be so seriously debilitating,&quot; says Tore Godal, M.D., director of the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme)/ World Bank/ WHO (World Health Organization) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR). &quot;The disease also causes scars, disfigurement and serious psycho-social problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Victims cannot sleep, find it difficult to work and fear that the disease might kill them; they also feel like social outcasts, uprooted from their communities; some even contemplate suicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Affected people are stereotyped as weak, emotionally dull and cold,&quot; the TDR study says. &quot;They are considered as dangerous, dirty and are avoided for fear that they might pass on their disease to others. The person who suffers from onchocercal skin disease is likened to an animal on the basis of his or her skin and behavior.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The skin disease caused by the &quot;forest&quot; strain affects all age groups but especially people 20-40 years old, the most productive members of society. In contrast, the blindness caused by the &quot;savanna&quot; strain of the disease affects mostly those over 40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Onchocerciasis is caused by an infection by the nematode worm Onchocerca volvulus for which man is the only known reservoir. The adult worms are usually found in subcutaneous (beneath the skin) nodules. The adult female worm produces millions of microfilariae (early larval forms of worms) that migrate to the skin and the eyes of the human host. The parasite is transmitted by a blackfly of the genus Simulium, which ingests microfilariae while taking blood from humans and then passes it on to non-infected humans when it takes their blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Onchocerciasis Control Program in West Africa (OCP), financed by an international consortium of donor countries and the World Bank, brought the disease under control in the savanna belt of the West African countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo. Control was achieved with a combination of spraying programs to kill the larvae of the blackfly and utilization of the drug invermectin, first begun in 1987, that prevents blindness in the infected by killing newly hatched worms. All doses of ivermectin are given at no cost by its manufacturer, Merck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside of the OCP, there are 16 nations where either form of the disease is endemic--Angola, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Liberia, Malawi, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. However, for these countries, there is as yet no coordinated international program to fight onchocerciasis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A recent WHO review shows that some 18 million people have either form of the disease, and that 15 million live outside the OCP. Of those, almost 9 million are infected with the &quot;forest&quot; strains, which cause a heavy burden of skin disease, according to the new study. The &quot;forest&quot; strains are widespread in the forest belt of West, Central and East Africa; the blinding variety is prevalent in the West African savanna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank and WHO, in collaboration with other sponsoring international agencies and a cadre of non-governmental development organizations, are preparing to fight the disease in the other 16 countries in a campaign called the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC).  The program is scheduled to take 10 years. Estimates show that the program will cost a maximum of $100 million. Funding will be mobilized by the World Bank from basically the same coalition of bilateral and multilateral donors which currently support the OCP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TDR's study was carried out in eight collaborative centers in severely infected onchocerciasis areas in West, Central and East Africa. Four centers were Nigeria and the others were in Tanzania and Uganda in East Africa, Cameroon in Central Africa and Ghana in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study used onchocerciasis affected villages and non-onchocerciasis affected villages as controls to provide a basis for comparison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This study utilized an innovative approach that was based on extensive psycho-social interviews with sufferers of onchocerciasis to learn how the disease affects their lives, as well as on new methods for the clinical classification of the skin disease itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New Program: The new effort aims to control both strains of river blindness outside the OCP area. To raise the necessary $100 million, The World Bank is asking aid from the donor countries, and the program is scheduled to begin operations in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If successful, the disease would be brought under full control in 10 years in all endemic countries, as long as none experience political instability,&quot; says Dr. Godal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TDR has been requested by the Bank to help solve key epidemiological, mapping, treatment, distribution and monitoring programs, and the feasibility of local blackfly eradication in isolated areas in the 16 non-OCP endemic countries. It may be possible, for example, to eradicate the fly vector completely from some parts of East Africa, where it seems the species can be eradicated with a matter of weeks or months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TDR has already resolved some of the questions. One of these was to devise a &quot;rapid mapping&quot; methods for onchocerciasis. &quot;Rapid epidemiological mapping allows us to find out where the hot spots of the disease are,&quot; says Dr. Godal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria is already fully mapped, and Cameroon will be done by June.  The survey will be completed in the remaining countries within one year. All of the information will be used to create a computer data base that will be available to everyone working on onchocerciasis control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, TDR is studying to see what ivermectin will do for the skin disease variety. To prevent blindness, just one dose of ivermectin per year is needed for those infected, but it is not yet known what dosage is required for the skin disease, though TDR scientists believe more than one dose per year will be necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TDR is also conducting a multi-nation research study as to how best bring a sustainable delivery of ivermectin over an indefinite period to all affected areas. It will be based upon a village-based delivery treatment system, called Community Self-Treatment. The study will compare the method of health specialists developing community plans to other methods developed by the communities themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experience to date indicates that ivermectin treatment is very popular among endemic populations and that communities can effectively take responsibility for their own treatments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should be possible to control onchocerciasis at very low cost with active community involvement and with the support of a coalition of non-governmental development organizations in the non-OCP countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Community self-treatment with ivermectin may also provide an important entry point for other community-based health interventions and thus help to develop a practical basis for strengthening primary health care in some of the poorest and most under-served communities in the world,&quot; says Dr.  Godal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Recent research findings clearly show that the people of highly endemic communities consider onchocerciasis, especially the grave and unrelenting itching, to be one of their main health problems and the cause of much misery,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ravan Renews The Best Of The Past</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weekly Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ravan, one of the stalwart anti-apartheid publishers of the dark years of South Africa's history, have started a new series of titles called the Ravan Writers Series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Ravan that first published JM Coetzee; that published Mongane Wally Serote's first (and thus far only) novel. Many of their books were banned by the white Nationalist government -- and its founder Peter Randall was restricted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, like so many other of the smaller local publishers, Ravan had a hard time of it even when the threat of repression had been lifted. While it continued to produce important titles, their appearance was often irregular -- and finances were no rosier than they had been in the Emergency years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent manoeuvres have given Ravan a new lease on life and the opportunity to capitalise on a backlist that includes some of South African literature's most interesting and important works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ravan Writers Series will also aim to attract and encourage a range of new and established writers, drawing them into the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The series has been launched with nine titles. They are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Yvonne Burgess' Say a Little Mantra for Me, a humorous picture of life in the confines of a South African family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Waiting for Leila by Achmat Dangor, which won the 1979 Mofolo-Plomer Prize in conjunction with Mzala by Mbulelo Mzamane, also in the Ravan Writers series. The former tells the story of a man frantically searching for a woman amid the destruction of District Six. The latter is a version of the Jim-Comes-to-Jo'burg tale, a humourous and penetrating view of township life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * David Muller's Whitey is a bleakly affecting novel focusing on one weekend in the life of a footloose, alcoholic sailor who finds himself in the depths of District Six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Ahmed Essop's novella The Emperor is a satire about a egotistical and authoritarian headmaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The Schoolmaster by Rose Moss presents the dilemmas of a man who defies an oppressive system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The World of Nat Nakasa, edited by Essop Patel, collects the work of one of South Africa's key black writers of the Fifties, showing off the &quot;loud and thunderous voice&quot; with which he challenged inequality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Noni Jabavu's The Ochre People is a delightfully warm-hearted memoir of a return to South Africa in 1955 by a woman who had grown up in this country but left for schooling in England at the age of 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Native Life in South Africa is a great classic of South African literature, a vital work by Sol T Plaatje, one of the ANC's founders and the first black person to publish a novel in English. It details the horrible results of the 1913 Land Act on the dispossessed people of South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Tony Karon</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beninoise artist Romuald Hazoume makes traditional religious masks -- out of discarded objects. 'I'm just sending back the rubbish sent from Europe to Africa,' he said. Hazoume probably turned more heads than any other artist visiting the Johannesburg Biennale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The young Beninoise exhibited a series of traditional religious masks crafted from plastic oil cans, old radios and other urban waste. On the opposite wall, he hung a series of complex paintings attempting a graphic representation of the oracle of divination used by the high priests of the Fa, the traditional Yoruba religion practised throughout West Africa (and, in adapted forms born of slavery, throughout the Americas).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibit commented with wry wit on Africa's relationship with the West, at the same time as expressing the artist's deep roots in Yoruba tradition -- and captivated most visitors to the Biennale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even those who overlooked the masks would not have failed to notice Hazoume's powerful physical presence, as he presided regally in his magnificent blue bubu alongside his work or at Biennale openings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wearing traditional clothing is a reflection of his overall strategy as an African artist operating abroad (primarily in Europe): &quot;We never forget where we are from, and we maintain our tradition. We wear our traditional clothes to show that people from Benin are here. It's our way, our culture.  If we don't do that, people here would think we are South African.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, he refuses to be categorised as a folk artist. On one occasion he travelled to Hamburg at the invitation of a German gallery owner, only to discover that he was to exhibit at an ethnological museum. He turned down the show. &quot;I am not an 'African artist'; I am an artist,&quot; he explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His work is located at an intersection between Yoruba tradition and a post-industrial international art market -- Hazoume carries his portfolio on CD Rom. His route to art was almost accidental. As an undergraduate student in Benin, with plans to go into either medicine or architecture, the university lost his exam papers. He left in disgust, and in the seething anger and depression which followed, he began to create collages on the bark of banana trees, and sell them to expatriate Europeans in Benin. From the proceeds, he bought a house and started making batik prints. That earned more money, and created a secure financial base for Hazoume to develop his own art works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, he concentrated on making masks, and was soon invited to exhibit all over Europe: &quot;In Africa, it is very sad that we don't have our sacred masks any more; they (Europeans) steal all. What I am doing with my masks is sending back the rubbish sent from Europe to Africa -- if I can get money for that, it's even better.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also sees himself as a recycler: &quot;Many Africans use this material and throw it away. If they can get it again in their house and pay me for it, it's wonderful. People don't realise that these materials can have two lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hazoume's masks, he stresses, have no ritual value: &quot;They are simply art.&quot; Nonetheless, they are firmly grounded in tradition: &quot;In our country we have a tradition of making sacred masks from wood. I cannot make masks without this tradition. Before I opened the exhibition in Johannesburg, we (he and his Beninoise curator) made a voudon ceremony here. There are many secret societies here in South Africa, of the animist religion. We needed to make a conversation with these people here in this ceremony, to ask permission to show our masks. If we don't have permission, nobody can see these masks.&quot; The ceremony was private, and the Biennale organisers were unaware of it. &quot;It is our problem, it is not a show.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A South African gallery owner interrupts our interview to offer Hazoume a show. &quot;Call me, let's talk,&quot; the owner urges. &quot;Why not?&quot; Hazoume sighs, a little warily. He doesn't like galleries, and is fiercely resisting the pressures of the European art market on African artists to produce work to order. &quot;I don't like to work with galleries or have an agent. An agent tells you what to do -- you work to get money from the agent. But money is not my problem. I just want to show something. If I have success, it's good.  If I don't, it doesn't matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the problem is the almost total absence of an African art market: &quot;African people have no interest in buying art,&quot; Hazoume sighs.  &quot;People in Benin cannot buy art, they have no money. And they don't understand this art. They don't understand how people can pay me money to buy these masks. To them it's crazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he has sold some work in Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, his ability to survive as an artist depends almost exclusively on sales to Europeans. &quot;European galleries want to show African work now because European work now is static, and less interesting. They want to see new work, new material.&quot; While this is cause for optimism, &quot;at the same time I am anxious.  Many African people like money too much, and have no dignity. I want to show our culture, not sell our culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He urges caution for South African artists dealing with Western markets: &quot;Today many museums and galleries want to show the work of African artists. But be careful! They will eat you so fast, and spit you out. Like Cheri Samba. It's so sad.&quot; He proceeds to relate how the celebrated Zairean artist has signed a contract with a European gallery which requires such a high volume of output that it has drastically reduced the value of his paintings: &quot;It's like a factory.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To negotiate the treacherous international art market, Hazoume believes the artist needs a strong sense of identity: &quot;Your best chance is to stay with your traditions,&quot; he advises South African artists. &quot;Think about your tradition -- each country has its own traditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took Hazoume five years to complete his divination paintings now hanging opposite his masks in the Electric Workshop in Newtown. But he was in no hurry, for they represent an exploration of the very core of his identity.  That exploration brought him and his inspired work to Johannesburg, which suggests that the Yoruba gods smiled (at least momentarily) on the much-maligned Johannesburg Biennale.</SPAN></P>

Mesmerised by the great jazz drummer Max Roach's playing, I then tried drums. Still my father said nothing to me about music. When I turned 15, I finally made up my mind to settle for drums as a means of expressing my artistic feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I broke my father's silence by telling him that I wanted to take up music as a career. Predictably, he gave me his blessing, but stressed that learning to read music was of paramount importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He asked the greats, Max Roach and Art Blakely, to teach me how to play drums. My father also sent me to college. His reticence about music with me, though, still remained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I turned 20, something very funny happened. My father called me and asked: &quot;Are you ready to play?&quot; Two days later, there I was playing alongside my father in his band. The show, which turned out to be a sensation, was screened on national TV and broadcast on radio. That's how I was baptised into jazz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MN: Can you define jazz?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TM: Like love, jazz defies a single definition. To me, jazz is an instrument of liberation- physical, spiritual and mental liberation. It activates freedom of thought. It is the mouthpiece of the oppressed. Jazz has played a significant role in the emancipation of the oppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When jazz began to flourish in the 30s, it was in demand. Black musicians traveled around the world where they witnessed democracy in practice. These roving ambassadors of jazz spread the message of democracy and what it meant. They began to see America from outside. This broadened their national and universal perspectives. Their ideas contributed to the civil rights movement. Their ideas also lent a clear understanding to the earlier liberatory writings of Frederick Douglas, W.E.B. DuBois and other who had led the struggle for freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jazz brought together Black Revolutionaries , white intellectual and liberals, particularly Jews. Jazz gave an impetus to the process of integration in the United States. Bringing people together was a priority of jazz. It was incumbent on it to forge a universal brotherhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What made jazz unique in America was that it was born of the oppressed human spirit in search of freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MN: How do you view current jazz trends?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TM: Compared to the 50s, 60s and 70s, the standard of jazz today is low. The reason for this is not hard to find. Within the last 20 years we have lost jazz legends who are not easy to replace. These include Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. This artistic holocaust, in which our leaders died so close to each other, left a huge gap in the world of jazz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are two chief characteristics of jazz which to a large extent make it a unique musical form- it has an intellectual impact on the masses while it simultaneously inculcates self-identity and pride. And this runs against the grain of the oppressor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MN: Does &quot;fusion&quot;, which to some people is an ultra-modern form of jazz, perhaps give us a glimpse of jazz in the 21st century?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TM: No. &quot;Fusion&quot; is not futuristic, it's the product of experimenting.  It was created when rock-and-roll became popular in the 60s. Jazz record companies feared that rock-and-roll was robbing jazz of popularity. So they instilled elements of rock-and-roll into jazz. The result was fusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behind fusion is a desire to get a broader audience. But the die-hard jazz fans greeted &quot;fusion&quot; with utter contempt. To them, it was not natural.  It was a commercial vehicle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MN: Tell us about the Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TM: It was founded in 1986 and we are expanding all the time. We want to establish a musical conservatory primarily for jazz. In almost all the world's musical institutes, classical music reigns supreme. We say jazz is supreme and rightfully so because jazz is the most influential music in the history of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We mold and enhance the talent of young people. We enlist the help of great musicians such as Herbie Hancock and Ramsey Lewis, among others, to teach the kids everything there is to learn about theory and jazz instruments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MN: How does it feel to be on African soil for the first time?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TM: I feel very new. It is as if I have been reborn. I feel like a native and foreigner all at once. I have a &quot;deja vu&quot; feel. I love and adore President Mandela. I count him among our great freedom fighters Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X, Kwame Nkrumah and many others. Mandela has restored the dignity of Black People all over the world. He is now at the helm of South Africa which was the last bastion of white supremacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is a lot that still needs to be done in the reconstruction of your country. That is why the Jazz Ambassadors and I will be coming back to South Africa to help in whatever way we can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ARTISTS of South Africa unite! This is the message that rang out loud and clear during last week's jazz workshops conducted by two top American jazz musicians, Thelonius Monk junior and Thomas Carter, at the United States Information Service in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two roving jazz ambassadors shared their 18 year experience of fund-raising for arts projects with representatives of local arts bodies during a fund -raising workshop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz, which was founded by the two artists, is a living symbol of the success of their fundraising techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it was founded in 1986, it had a mere 100 dollars in its coffers.  Within 9 years, the Institute's bank account had swollen by hundreds of thousands of dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both men urged local arts bodies to amalgamate into a single powerful organisation as the first step towards raising the funds on which their survival depends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Carter said there were two vital aspects to be considered. The first was the size of the organisation's membership. The other was the donors' preference for funding one large organisation rather than advancing money to many small organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present there are several dozen arts organisations in South Africa, characterised by a lack of interaction and joint effort. Instead they continually compete for overseas donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The public image and credibility of the organisations in search of funds are of vital importance. According to Carter, one way of acquiring the right image is to co-opt enthusiastic and respectable public figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Thelonius Monk Institute of Jazz is a case in point. Carter pointed out that the co-chairpersons on the institute's board of directors were the famous comedian, Bill Cosby, and the popular Black actor, Billy Dee Williams, who co-stars in the classic film &quot;Lady Sings the Blues&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Their association with the Institute gives it a positive image and credibility in the eyes of potential donors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monk stressed the need for influential contacts across a broad social spectrum. &quot;Contacts are an essential aspect of fundraising. Make acquaintance with those in influential positions like politicians, journalists, wealthy business people, lawyers and others. They can be your mouthpiece in debates on the arts,&quot; Monk said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When an organisaton sets out in search of funds, it must be clear about its goals, policies and strategies. Its mission statement must be explicit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For you to win the favour of a potential donor, you must be eloquent and convincing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the brochure or journal of organisation you must acknowledge the company's donation and promote the sales of its products. Expose, isolate and boycott the commodities of those companies which turn down requests for donations,&quot; said Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If these strategies have worked and turned Thelonious Monk Institute Jazz Ambassadors into a prestigious music body in the USA, how can our financially struggling arts bodies fail to rise to the challenge?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 13, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Godwin Agbroko</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Book Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Title: &quot;Diplomatic Baggage-MOSSAD and Nigeria: The Dikko Story</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Author: Kayode Soyinka</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Publishers: Newswatch Books Ltd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even as a practising Muslim, Umaru Dikko as a politician could do with Christ's admonition that it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a man, but what comes out of it. At a time the citizenry was being pauperised by his ruling National Party of Nigeria, NPN, Dikko chose to make his now infamous rebuttal that there was no hunger in the land. His evidence: Nigerians had not started to eat from the dustbins!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a senior minister in government and the man charged with procuring rice for Nigerians, Dikko's choice of logic was not impolitic, it was insensitive. Nigerians at the time may not have been scavenging the dustbins for food, not because they had a choice in the matter, but most certainly because there were no leftovers in the dustbins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Add to that his haughty carriage, his air of omnipotence, his peculiar ability to arouse suspicion of corruption to himself even as he tried to cut the picture of a man more sinned against than sinning, then Dikko was clearly a throw-back to the era of the divine right of kings, where the monarch could do no wrong; and a bad king was a reproach for a people for their sinful ways. For Nigerians, Dikko was the symbol of all that was vile in the Shagari administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, the military in their self-righteousness refused to see the Shagari &quot;monarchy&quot; as a reproach. They struck on December 31, 1983 and sent Dikko and his NPN colleagues scurrying abroad for safety. In Britain to where he fled, Dikko, that rare politician who would not chew his words before uttering began a verbal &quot;jihad&quot; to mobilise his fellow countrymen to chase away the interlopers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was in furtherance of this mission that Dikko set out that morning of July 5, 1984, from his Porchester Terrace residence in London, for an interview appointment with a Ghanaian journalist. A few meters away from his home, he was forcibly abducted, anaesthetised, crated as diplomatic baggage, and taken to Sanstead Airport to be air freighted home. The attempt, though botched, resonated throughout the world. Overnight, Nigeria had joined the league of international brigands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten years after, Kayode Soyinka, &quot;Newswatch's&quot; London bureau chief, has returned to the subject with a book, &quot;Diplomatic Baggage-Mossad and Nigeria: The Dikko Story&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Soyinka's help, the &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; of the Dikko saga can now be stitched together reasonably firmly. In the author's hand, the tale acquires a fresh life, taking on new meanings in the telling. For sure, he is a journalist, not a historian, and when he tells of an episode, he does not so much reproduce it as reconstruct it. In that reconstruction, &quot;Diplomatic Baggage&quot; takes the reader on a cinematic, breezy journey of discovery, the eloquence finding expression in the literary technique of narration and explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Revelation for the reader begins with the question, why Dikko alone?  Why not Augustus Akinloye, the chairman of the NPN reputed by the military, though untrue, to own a vineyard abroad for making his own choice champagne?  Why not Bello Maitama Yusuf, the Czar of the import license regime? As the author shows quite early and rather persuasively, Dikko was a victim of the fabulous myth of his own life, a man condemned in the eyes of the military and Nigerians by his own mouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same persuasive argument connects the government of Muhammad Buhari to the kidnap attempt. Calling in evidence the role of Nigerian diplomats and military intelligence officers; the behaviour of the Nigerian government and its high commissioner to the court of St. James before and after the event; and Dikko's own activities as minister of exile in Britain.  &quot;Diplomatic Baggage&quot; provides strong clues to which other researchers may have to turn to unravel the answers. The most compelling of the clues is the theory that the National Security Organisation, NSO, may have planned and executed the kidnap, neither with the knowledge of the ministry of external affairs, nor with the imprimatur of the head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That could have been made possible by the structural jumble that defined, rather ambivalently, the relationship between the NSO and the external affairs ministry on the one hand, and the personalities of the heads of the two organs on the other. Mohammed Lawal Rafindadi, newly-appointed director-general of the NSO, was an envoy of long-standing who had capped his foreign service career as Nigeria's ambassador to Bonn. Obviously, he knew more about the internal workings of the ministry than Ibrahim Gambari, who, prior to his appointment as minister was director-general of the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs, NIIA. To confound the situation, the ministry's research department by the decree establishing the NSO, was brought under the intelligence organisation as its external wing and renamed the Directorate of External Intelligence. As if that was not bad enough, Rafindadi, as chief intelligence officer, was a member of the supreme military council, the highest ruling body, while the external affairs minister was not. Of course, it would be less than human given the situation if the NSO director-general did not feel superior to the minister. As Gambari himself put it, &quot;he (Rafindadi) appeared to have seen himself as a member of the supreme military council with the supervisory role over this ministry -- a view I did not accept. Worse still, some senior officers in our ministry were fond on currying favour whit the NSO boss and attempted to involve him in personal or policy decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In such a situation, anyone, particularly the NSO director-general, was capable of taking advantage of the confusion where the ministry of external affairs exercised administrative supervision over the staff of the department of external intelligence while operational control was with the mother agency, the NSO. Given the criminal zeal of the NSO at the time, was it not possible, as the author suggests, that Rafindadi may have suborned Peter Oyedele and Okon Edet, the two Nigerian diplomats involved in the abduction, in order to shore up his credentials as a crack intelligence manager in a regime that was already pre-disposed toward arbitrariness?  Unfortunately, the answer must await the fullness of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to this, there is no doubt. Even if Rafindadi were to have acted on his own, the Buhari regime, in providing the enabling environment by its own arbitrariness, was vicariously guilty of the crime. So too must Nigerians share in the blame. By their vengeful spirit and condemnation of the political class without proven guilt, they unwittingly encouraged the wholesale abridgment of fundamental human rights and the subsequent brigandage abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When we come to the MOSSAD connection, we are on a less firmer ground.  Of the four men arrested and tried for Dikko's forcible abduction, only one, Mohammed Yusuf, a military intelligence officer was a Nigerian, the other, Israelis. They were the ring leader -Alexander Barak, a diamond dealer and MOSSAD operative; Felix Abithol, a clothing importer; and Lev-Arie Shapiro, the anaesthetist who drugged Dikko. Although Shapiro may have though that he was working for Israel through the MOSSAD, probably because of the intelligence connections of Barak, the man who recruited him, there is no hard evidence to suggest that this was so. Barak himself testified on trial that he carried out the plot on behalf of certain businessmen who wanted Dikko back on trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Denial is not, however, a refutation. The fact that the abductors entered a guilty plea foreclosed inquiry on many fronts. and in a failed enterprise of this nature, Barak's denial and that of Israel is to be expected. But given the pervasive presence of the MOSSAD later in Nigeria, its role in the Dikko affair, and subsequently in Nigeria's intelligence outfits the issue merits more critical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Diplomatic Baggage&quot; is not all about Dikko. In a way it is a miniaturised history of the Shagari era, its 286 pages running a wide gamut.  Its sweep covers the background to what the author refers to as a madness' the kidnap attempt itself and the ensuing diplomatic face-off; the expensive extradition process and why it failed; and the debauchery of the time tagged the Fourgerolle affair. It ends on a poignant note in the reversal of fortunes that saw to Dikko's home coming. Hear Dikko in 1991 as an exile: &quot;I appreciate more the value and quality of law. The law saved me here, so I have a greater respect for law. These years of exile have assisted me to see the beauty of democracy, to see the value of liberty to understand more the value of freedom. Here, they render their business based on the rule of law.  That is what is called a refined society. that is what I want my society to become.&quot; Dikko on his way home in 1994: &quot;Tell him (Buhari) some people are already calling my arrival in Nigeria the latest political coup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is the kind of repartee that makes the reader look balefully into nothingness, stamp his feet repeatedly on the ground, and mutter to himself, &quot;There goes Dikko again.&quot; In a way, Dikko symbolises Nigeria's political class who like the Bourbons have learnt nothing and forgotten nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All in all, &quot;Diplomatic Baggage&quot; is a bold attempt at reconstructing the events of the time, and putting them in perspective for the records.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum for African Art</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Animals in African Art, a major exhibition of approximately 100 works which runs March 31 through August 31, 1995 at the Museum for African Art in SoHo, holds surprises for people of all ages. Visitors will discover that the animals they usually associate with Africa-such as zebras, giraffes, and lions- are almost never depicted in traditional African art. Instead, artists render animals which are unusual because of how they look or act. Frequently, the more remarkable the animal, the more commonly it is depicted. These animals, which are associated with healing, hunting, and spirit possession, include antelopes, bats, buffaloes, spiders, and chameleons, among others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Animals in African Art&quot; proceeds from the familiar to the marvelous.  The exhibit begins with images of village animals, such as dogs, chickens, and oxen. It continues with images of wild animals of the land, air, and water. Next, many animals which cross categories-such as fish that climb trees (pangolins) and snakes that swim (pythons)- are presented. Following this, the exhibition devotes itself to art that represents felines, then magical creatures that combine human and animal traits, and finally humans and animals interacting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibit also challenges conventions in exhibition design.  conceived to be enjoyed simultaneously by people of all ages, &quot;Animals&quot; will contain an exhibition-within-an-exhibition just for children. Many objects will be displayed at a height and in a manner engaging to children, and accompanying wall texts and labels will be user-friendly for young visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This exhibition is a key part of a city-wide collaborative organized by the New School for Social Research to explore the relationship between humans and animals. Animal-related exhibitions and public programs will also be held at the Jewish Museum and The Asia Society. A national conference, &quot;In the Company of Animals,&quot; will be hosted by the New School from April 6 to 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curators for &quot;Animals in African Art&quot; are Allen F. Roberts (Guest Curator), Associate Professor of Anthropology and African-American World Studies and Co-Director of the Project for Advanced Study of Art and Life in Africa (PASALA) at the University of Iowa, and Carol Thompson, Associate Curator, Museum for African Art.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York-- Grace C. Stanislaus, formerly director of the Bronx Museum of the Arts, has been named executive director of the Museum for African Art, the Trustees of the Museum announced recently. She assumes her position on February 13, 1995, replacing Susan Vogel, the Museum's founder and former director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Stanislaus, who is 36 years old, has a national reputation as a dynamic museum professional with a fresh approach to the issues that confront museums and proven experience as an institution builder. As director of The Bronx Museum for the Arts, from 1992 to 1994, she provided the managerial and intellectual leadership that brought in new audiences, doubled the size of the permanent collection, and increased the budget, while she initiated a collections management program and revitalized the museum's curatorial and educational programming.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shortly after she receive her Master's in Art History form Columbia University, she joined The Studio Museum in Harlem as a curator, and from 1983 to 1992, developed groundbreaking exhibitions, oversaw the development of the permanent collection, supervised the Artists-in-Residence Program and published a number of well-received articles. While there, she organized a traveling exhibition of contemporary African art, &quot;Contemporary African Artists: Changing Tradition,&quot; and curated the first exhibition of contemporary African art at the 1990 Venice Biennale. Ms. Stanislaus has also authored many fine catalogue essays about contemporary African-American, African and immigrant artists. She is a much sought-after speaker nationally and internationally, lecturing on African-American art, multiculturalism, African art, museums and public education in a pluralistic society, and she has traveled extensively in West, Central, Southern and East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Stanislaus' other professional activities include serving as a panelist for the NEA and New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), and a reviewer for the College Art Association and the Institute of Museum Services (IMS). She is also a member of the Association of Art Museum Directors, and Secretary of the Board of ArtTable, an organization of women in leadership positions in the visual arts. She participated in the Museum Management Institute Training Program, which is sponsored by the J. Paul Getty Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;While we interviewed many fine candidates over the last three months, Ms. Stanislaus was our hands-down, first choice,&quot; said Board Trustee Jason Wright, Senior VP at RJR Nabisco and head of the Search Committee at the Museum for African Art. &quot;We can think of no better person to lead this museum into the next century. Grace is a talented institution builder - a creative, responsive leader who knows how to raise money, attract new audiences and nurture the next generation of African art enthusiasts and collectors. She will make a critical contribution to the Museum's future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;After a decade of first-rate exhibitions and scholarly publications, the Museum for African Art is today one of the most important centers for the presentation of African art worldwide,&quot; said Ms. Stanislaus. &quot;The Museum's exhibitions have enhanced our appreciation of African art and deepened our understanding about issues of context and the methodologies of display. As Executive Director, I look forward to the challenge of building on these past successes and strengthening our institutional foundation for future growth.  With a dedicated Board and staff, and with the support of the Museum's many friends, the next decade and the new millennium promise renewed excitement as we work together to expand the institution's resources and public outreach.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum also announced that Frank Herreman joins the staff as Director of Exhibitions reporting to Ms. Stanislaus. Mr. Herreman, an Africanist of international reputation is currently associate director of the Historical Museums of the City of Antwerp, and head of the Antwerp Museum of Ethnography in Belgium. His reputation as a scholar, his knowledge of African artworks, and his aesthetic judgment are considered outstanding by those in the field. Most recently he curated &quot;Face of the Spirits&quot; an exhibition of Zairean masks that was featured at the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Herreman, who formally joins the Museum on July 1, 1995, will work closely with the Executive Director to plan future exhibitions and related educational programs, and oversee museum installations and publications. He will select and collaborate with guest curators, supervise the curatorial staff and play a critical role in shaping the intellectual and artistic component of all exhibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're delighted to have someone of Frank's stature willing to relocate from Belgium to join the Museum. His considerable expertise in the field of African art will be a valued asset as we move forward,&quot; said Mr.  Wright.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum for African Art is the only independent museum in the country devoted exclusively to presenting historical African art. Over the past ten years, the Museum has developed an international reputation for offering insights into Sub-Saharan art and culture through its exhibitions, educational and travel programs. It is well-known among public and private collectors, as well as the general public, for providing an educative context for appreciating African art. Since its inception in 1984, the Museum has circulated its exhibitions, curated with exceptional depth and expertise, to 46 national and international museums, giving broad access to African artworks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum moved into its current space in New York's SoHo district in February 1993. The Museum's interior, designed by award-winning architect Maya Lin, creator of the Viet Nam Veteran's Memorial in Washington, encompasses some 17,000 square feet-- tripling the size of its original home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ms. Stanislaus and Mr. Herreman will have a chance to meet the entire Board and Museum members, supporters and friends when &quot;Animals in African Art&quot; (March 31- December 31, 1995) opens in March.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weekly Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 24, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By Jacques Magliolo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A statement by Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals (in January) fuelled rumours that the financial rand would be scrapped within weeks. However, according to a number of economists and analysts, the speculation seems optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The finrand was introduced by the Reserve Bank to discourage foreigners from removing funds from South Africa. In effect, a company wanting to operate here would obtain finrands at a better rate than commerical rands for their currency. But if they wanted to disinvest the exchange rate used would be at the less favourable commercial rand rate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stals was reported as saying the Reserve Bank had secured foreign credit of close to R12-billion to support the exchange rate once the dual currency system was abolished. He added that the underlying conditions for the scrapping of the finrand were improving all the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pre-conditions are: the discount rate, which is the percentage difference between the commercial and financial rands, has to remain at 10 percent for a reasonable period of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Massive buying by foreign banks of finrands in anticipation of the scrapping of the unit (before Stal's speech) is driving down the discount rate,&quot; says Southern Life economist Sandra Gordon. The discount rate fell to 10 percent last week and had maintained this level by Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says another economist: &quot;The low discount rate has, in turn, fueled these rumours. However, the rate is merely one of three pre-conditions which has to be fulfilled before Stals can recommend to the cabinet that the units be unified.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gordon adds: &quot;Stals has said that the discount rate has to remain at a rate of at most 10 percent for a reasonable period of time.What that time is, is anyone's guess.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Non-resident holders of South African assets should not dispose of these assets after the two currencies have been combined. In other words, the pool of finrands must decrease over time. But no time frame has been provided by the Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would be best achieved by a continuing increase in foreign investor confidence in the country. This should, in turn, be reflected in a sustained reduction in the finrand discount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, political turbulence such as the Inkatha Freedom Party's walkout from parliament is likely to decrease foreign investor confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actual pool of finrand deposits (on an annual basis) increased at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> the end of 1994 to R6,4-billion from 1993's R4,4-billion. Speculation of the scrapping was further supported by Stals revealing this week that finrand balances had fallen to about R5,5-billion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newswatch (Lagos)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 20, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Joseph Ode</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The uncertainty which had pervaded the financial sector over the operation of the new foreign exchange system introduced as part of the 1995 federal budget was cleared last week. The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, said in a press statement signed by Tony Ede, manager, corporate affairs, that commercial and merchant banks were free to sell and buy foreign exchange from any source at any rate. Further directives on the market's operation, the CBN said, would be issued when necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the bank, there was no basis for the uncertainty and low level of foreign exchange in the first place since the guidelines it issued on January 17 had spelt out the mode of operation of the market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main features of the new system according to the guidelines, are the return of the autonomous inter bank foreign exchange market, IFEM, where individuals and organisations are free to buy and sell foreign exchange at market-determined rates, and the cancellation of regular bidding and allocation of foreign exchange to dealer-banks by the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. In the new dispensation, all foreign exchange earned by government parastatals, government companies, agencies and companies in which government has majority share holding; oil exploration, producing and service companies as well as loans and grants are to be channeled to the domiciliary accounts with the CBN at prevailing autonomous rates. Such funds are to be used by the CBN to intervene in and influence the autonomous market in order to ensure reasonable stability in the market. However, priority government foreign exchange obligations will continue to be funded by the CBN at the official exchange rate of N22 to US$1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Newswatch learnt that no bank really complied with the ban on the autonomous market last year, except that transactions in that respect were carried out below the counter at rates close to the black market's. The official return of the autonomous market this year has merely intensified such transactions. A treasury manager with a merchant bank in Lagos explained to Newswatch that his bank, like many others, was reluctant to come out openly to engage in autonomous forex transactions for fear that it might incur the wrath of the CBN if its documentation now is at variance with CBN requirements when the guidelines are eventually released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other banks, however, commenced official transactions ahead of last week's clarification by the CBN. Among them are Citizens International Bank, Wema Bank, Nigeria Merchant Bank and Eco Bank. Yemi Cardoso, executive director and head of treasury And financial institutions group of Citizens Bank said his bank commenced autonomous forex transactions immediately after the budget without hesitation because the CBN had come out clearly to say that the market was free subject to certain guidelines and some existing foreign exchange decrees. Moreover, he said, the philosophy of the CBN on the new foreign exchange system is very clear, and similar to what operates in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the commencement of the new system, autonomous exchange rate, on the average, has been close to the black market rate. From about N83 to the dollar about a fortnight ago, the rate has fallen to between N70 and N76 to the dollar. A treasury manager with one of the banks who requested anonymity attributed the trend to expectations that the Central Bank might intervene to narrow the margin between the autonomous and the official exchange rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cardoso said the mopping up of N10 billion from the banking system in January through the issuance of stabilisation securities by the CBN must have also aided the appreciation of the naira. But how long the trend will last, according to Cardoso, will depend, to a large extent, on the consistency and volume of CBN intervention and the rate at which it is done. J.O. Ekundayo, president of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria, CIBN, however, foresees a situation where the naira would depreciate as a result of a possible lag in implementation of the new forex system. But he advised government not to allow itself to be stampeded into taking a reverse measure.  &quot;The naira will afterwards recover with strict adherence to the new policy,&quot; he predicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Generally, reactions to the foreign exchange and other policies enunciated in the 1995 budget have been mixed. Although most of the policies are said by analysts to be in the right direction, many are skeptical about their realisation based on government's poor track record on budget implementation and certain signals so far in the new year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, the re-introduction of the autonomous market is widely hailed as a measure capable of reopening the channels of foreign exchange inflow, especially from non-oil sources. This agrees largely with the call by the Manufactures Association of Nigeria, MAN, for a move away from a fixed exchange rate regime to a market-oriented managed floating system spiced with CBN intervention to ensure firmness and stability of the rate. But MAN, in its reaction to the budget has stressed the need for an effective and efficient implementation of the system. &quot;Otherwise,&quot; the association warned, &quot;there is the danger of a cycle of unremitting depreciation of the exchange rate and instability if the policy is mismanaged and forex is available only to the highest bidder. Under such a grim scenario, the main casualty is the manufacturing sector which has the scales loaded against it in any competition for forex and bank credit with finished goods importers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manufacturers want the government to compel the banks to ensure that 60 percent of the available foreign exchange goes to the manufacturing industry. They also want import duty payments to be made at the official rate to avoid abnormal cost burden on manufacturers which will make the prices of goods unaffordable. But, on the other hand, MAN would want all government transactions to be carried out at the autonomous rate. &quot;In the national interest, there is no reason why such transactions should have priority over manufacturing and agriculture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Generally financial experts are not too critical of the new interest policy for 1995. Unlike last year when both lending and deposit rates were fixed, only a maximum spread of 7.5 percent between the lending and deposit rates has been prescribed for this year, subject to a maximum lending rate of 21 percent. The only question being raised by commentators on the budget is whether government can bring inflation down to a level that would make the prescribed interest rates positive. &quot;Given the conservative estimate of inflation currently at over 70 percent, real savings rate is highly negative,&quot; said Erastus Akingbola, managing director of Intercontinental Merchant Bank. According to Femi Adekanye, chairman and chief executive of Commerce Bank, &quot;If the government loses the battle against inflation, there would be no economic justification to keep running a controlled interest rate policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are conflicting signals however, over the ability of the government to win the war on inflation. Last year, prices moved on the back of the exchange rate in the parallel market despite the existence of a much lower statutory rate. As Akingbola put it, &quot;virtually everything, including local vegetables and tomatoes, was priced on this basis.&quot; Some analysts believe that the return of the autonomous market will push the parallel market rate down, as is already happening, and with it the level of inflation. Akingbola believes that inflation can be brought down substantially within the broad framework of the budget. However, given the present level of liquidity in the system and the potential source of excess liquidity during the year - World Youth Soccer championships, political activities, etc., - he believes that the authorities would need to rely on more monetary policies to put inflation in check.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manufacturers feel that some of the fiscal measures of government this year like the proposed lease/commercialisation of some of its enterprises, and the new tariff structure may deny government victory in its declared war on inflation. &quot;Experience in the last nine years,&quot; says MAN.  &quot;shows that in all cases, commercialisation so far implemented has taken on the nature of arbitrary increases in tariffs and charges without corresponding improvement in services provided. The snowballing effect on the cost of operation of industries has inevitably affected the prices of consumer goods adversely.&quot; MAN also believe that high levels and range of excise duty as well as the widened base of VAT can exacerbate the inflationary level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, Akinola Owosekun, director, research and policy analysis, department of the national planning commission, who carried out a study on various aspects of the economy has predicted that inflation would be the most serious economic problem in 1995. &quot;This high rate of inflation will result from the fuller impact of the increases in the prices of petroleum products and from the further depreciation of the naira in the autonomous markets. The forecast is for a weighted overall rate of inflation of 233.62 percent. Every component of the consumer price index will be advesarely affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the monetary policies, government's fiscal policies for 1995 have generally been hailed. They include the broadening of the revenue base especially the value-added tax. VAT; reduction in personal income tax and increase in tax relief and tax incentives for manufactures and exporters.  What bothers most analysts is whether government will keep faith with its proposals, when it comes to implementation. For instance, despite a provision for zero deficit in the 1994 budget, government deficit spending amounted to N81 billion. &quot;Judging by this performance, which again is consistent with past performances,&quot; says Adekanye, we may have to prepare ourselves for budget deficits in excess of N150 billion in 1995 when a budget deficit of N12 billion is projected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another example of inconsistency in policy implementation which analysts are pointing to is the recourse to stabilisation securities last month to reduce excess liquidity in the banking system. The use of the instrument was suspended in 1993 with the introduction of the Open Market Operation, OMO as an alternative, indirect instrument of monetary control.  &quot;The emerging signal from this sudden change in policy is that fiscal 1995 could be another year of destabilising official intervention... If stabilisation debits would be the major instruments of monetary management in 1995, we should warm up for a major financial crisis,&quot; according to Adekanye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M. O. Ojo, director of research at CBN, said last week that the apex bank itself was not very comfortable with the use of stabilisation securities. &quot;However, it should be made known that many central banks, including those of developed countries apply the same instrument in various guises or at least reserve its use for emergency purposes.&quot; The emergency, in this case, was the need&quot; to start off the fiscal year without further increasing inflationary expectations and particularly to support the new foreign exchange market mechanism.&quot; According to the CBN monetary guidelines, &quot;stabilisation securities are to be retained as an instrument of monetary control in 1995. However, their use will be phased out in the course of the year if prevailing monetary conditions so permit.&quot; For Lateef Owoyemi, president of the Nigerian Association of Management Consultants, NAMCON, merely highlighting the merits and demerits of the budget, as has been the case since independence has not led the country anywhere. His advice is for Nigerians to focus post-budget attention on what each group should do to enhance effective implementation and a happier year for Nigerians. &quot;Any budget needs a moral underpinning to succeed. It needs more than the CBN to make the outlined interest rate and foreign exchange regimes work successfully and the policies cannot achieve much unless businessmen and bankers resolve to play fairly in 1995.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda is to withdraw National Resistance Army (NRA) battalion from the ECOMOG peace-keeping force now in Monrovia, according to a top ECOMOG commander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During an interview on Radio Channel Africa, the external service of the South African Broadcasting Corporation Tuesday, Major General Olapade said that financial considerations and frustrations with the slow pace of the peace process in Liberia were the main reasons behind Uganda's decision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Major General also said Tanzania, the only other East African country contributing peace keeping forces in the war-ravaged West African nation of Liberia has also decided to pull out its battalion of 800 soldiers citing financial constraints back home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the commander, authorities in Dar-es-Salaam say Monrovia was hurting the Tanzanian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also attributed Tanzania's withdrawal to the complexity of the Liberian case. &quot;The Tanzanians say their forces were told that they had a duty that would last for only six months but now are fed up with a conflict that seems very far from ending, &quot;the Major General said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Monitor's&quot; efforts to contact the NRA Public Relations Officer Major Ronald Katunguka yesterday were futile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1993 several African countries contributed troops to help observe peace and order in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to now, a disagreement among the war-lords over who should sit on the governing council has delayed the proposed peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 8, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Ahmed Musoga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an unusual revelation, President Yoweri Museveni during a speech marking the 14th anniversary of the National Resistance Army (NRA) at Kakyeka Stadium in Mbara, February 6, named two senior Uganda government officials as Banyarwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President was contrasting the failure of neighboring countries like Rwanda and Sudan to solve their problems, with the NRM's accommodative approach. &quot;We have Ruzidana (IGG and CAD Ruhaama) a Tutsi and Justice Ntabgoba a Hutu and they both support us. So how can they fail to work together in Rwanda to work together in Rwanda while they speak the same language?&quot;, Museveni wondered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President warned Constituent Assembly delegates against &quot;playing about with the constitution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We fought to enfranchise Uganda, so for and one to play monkey tricks with the Constitution he must be hanged,&quot; said Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that although he had for the time being spared some people destined for the gallows, those who play about with the new Constitution &quot;will be finished&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If NRA has accepted to do away with its name which many people don't know how it was reached upon and be called Uganda Armed Forces (UAF) then who are those who cannot abide by what the constitution decides?&quot; he asked amidst clapping from the soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He warned the delegates against playing cheap politics in the process implanting sensitive provision in the constitution which might turn out to be time bombs and explode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President criticised those delegates agitating for districts to retain all the revenue from industries within their localities, calling such an idea ridiculous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That aside, the celebrations had other interesting episodes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, retired Bishop, Amos Betungura who arrived while the President was inspecting the guard of honour was nearly thrown out. He was only saved by the NRA Chief of Protocol, Major Bwende. This did not go down well with the junior officers who said that not even Jesus is allowed in after the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then came the NPC, Eriya Kategaya who arrived 30 minutes after his boss, but nobody complained as he wriggled himself through the soldiers before being asked to proceed straight to his VIP seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Minister of State for Security, Col. Kahinda Otafire arrived an hour and a half later and headed straight to his seat without a hitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strangely, the people of Mbarara who braved a morning drizzle were locked out of the stadium. It was only after the Commander in Chief had inspected the guard of honour that he intervened and the masses were let in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The master of ceremonies, Lt. Col. Sserwanga Lwanga had something exciting in stock for the people. Among several name mix-ups, he introduced the Inspector General of Police (Cossy Odomel) as Cosmas Adyebo. He at one time referred to Major Bwende as Major General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost all army top brass with the notable exception of Maj. Gen.  David Tinyefuza, attended the function.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A four person delegation from Christian Solidarity International (CSI) made the organisation's fifth visit to Sudan between 19 and 25 January. CSI is a non-denominational Christian human rights and humanitarian organisation organisation which champions the cause of persecuted people around the world.  CSI has been involved in monitoring the persecution of Moslems and non-Moslems in Sudan for several years now. The conditions the delegation witnessed were as bad as any that had been seen on CSI's earlier visits to Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegation had hoped to visit the Nuba Mountains but logistics prevented this. However, a delegation from that area traveled by foot to Pariang, in northwestern Upper Nile, in order to tell stories of atrocities committed against them by the Islamic Fundamentalist regime to the CSI delegation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As with the previous three visits by CSI, the delegation comprised of Baroness Caroline Cox of the British House of Lords, John Eibner of CSI and the Bishop of El Obeid, Macram Max Gassis. The bishop is an outspoken critic of the regime who was forced into exile and who has taken every opportunity offered to get close to his diocese and hear the complaints of his flock. His diocese covers the whole of Western Sudan and includes the Nuba Mountains area as well as that of the Ngok Dinka of Abyei. A large number of his diocesans have been displaced by the regime's activities and have fled into areas held by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), such as Pariang in Upper Nile and Mayen Akun in Bahr El Ghazal. Bishop Gassis has tried to regularly visit these otherwise uncared for people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CSI delegation was accompanied by a media team from the Associated Press and Television, and also by a member of the German Evangelical Church of Westphalia, Ernst Albert von Renesse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;On Regime's Invitation&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the CSI first visited Sudan five years ago, they did so at the invitation of the Khartoum regime, which tried to manage their visit and only take the delegation to sanitised areas under Khartoum's control. Even so, the CSI delegation produced a highly critical report based on what they saw and heard, and as a result Khartoum has never invited the organisation back. The CSI is now limited to visiting only those areas controlled by the SPLA in Southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains; &quot;- assessing aspects of the need for humanitarian aid and delivering a consignment of medical supplies, especially in areas officially denied access by the regime, where problems could be expected to be particularly acute; and &quot;- showing concern for, and solidarity with victims of repression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from Pariang in Upper Nile, which was known to be facing problems with people displaced from the Nuba Mountains, the CSI mission visited: Marial in Bahr El Ghazal, which as known to be facing many problems such as acute shortages of food and water, many people dying of starvation and treatable diseases, and a lack of medicines, clothing and blankets; and Kapoeta in Eastern Equatoria, to investigate reports of heavy fighting in the area and to assess the implications.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conditions in all the areas visited were harsh and difficult, but perhaps two areas stand out from all the rest. These were Pariang and Kapoeta The CSI mission wrote of Pariang in their report: &quot;The situation of the people in SPLA- controlled parts of the Nuba Mountains is desperate. Enormous suffering is caused by the lack of medicine and medical professionals, and the dearth of adequate water supplies. The intensity of military action in the Nuba Mountains was generally low during the rainy season, which ended last autumn. However, Government of Sudan (GOS) offensives from its garrison at Burnam resulted in the burning of at least eleven villages: Kordofan, Masakin, Gisar, Zuwal, El Ganaya, Angolo, Demadrajo, Kodel, Kacham and Umsrdeba. In the previous dry season the villages of Tore, including its large Christian church, and Sarf Gamius were razed. Ghound Abrahim, Ibrahim Tilmz and Osman El Murad were murdered by GOS forces in the latter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kapoeta the CSI mission visited Kapoeta Catholic Church in the company of SPLA Commander Thomas Cirillo and Bishop Paride Taban and wrote about it in their report: &quot;Cdr. Cirillo is directing the siege of Kapoeta. He served as an officer in the GOS artillery corps in Juba until June 1993 when he and his troops mutinied and joined the SPLA who were then besieging Juba The siege of Kapoeta began last October. Approximately 2,000 government troops, including a recently arrived relief convoy from Bor, are now trapped in the town's underground bunkers, according to the Commander. Virtually all of the local civilian population is believed to have left Kapoeta before the SPLA sealed off the town. As we spoke with Cdr. Cirillo, a GOS Antonov repeatedly circled overhead forcing us to take cover in bunkers, and the sound of gunfire and exploding artillery shells filled the air. Eight civilians died and three were wounded as a result of a GOS Antonov bombing raid in the vicinity of Kapoeta on January 23. During our visit to Sudan, scores of wounded civilians and SPLA soldiers have been reportedly arriving in northern Kenya from the scene of the battle. Cdr. Cirillo said that the GOS forces kill all SPLA soldiers who fall into their hands, while the SPLA takes prisoners and treats them according to the Geneva Convention. He said that he now had about 200 POWs from the battle of Kapoeta. Bishop Paride confirmed that he has been allowed to visit them and that they have been treated humanely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Cdr. Cirillo is a former altar boy and remains a practising Catholic.  He views the GOS's war against the South as a war to Islamise Sudan. He said: Before battle the Mujahadeen and other Islamic fundamentalist zealots customarily shout and chant: 'We will force you to become Muslim whether you want to or not.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;'The Muslim fundamentalists cannot defeat us. We are firm as Christians, and we will die for our faith. Our struggle is not against Islam or against Muslims, but is against a fundamentalist regime that wants to destroy our African heritage and faith. It is discouraging to see the Islamic fundamentalist government in Khartoum receive material and moral support from other Islamic countries, while we receive no support from the Christian world. But we will continue our struggle for freedom even if we are forsaken by Christendom... We will die for our faith and we will die Christians.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report makes several findings and recommendations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Findings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(1) The GOS continues to try to transform by force the ethnically and religiously diverse country into an Arab, Islamic state, against the wishes of the vast majority of its black African population. The devastating effects of this policy are tantamount to attempted genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(2) The mass displacement of the population of the South and of the Nuba Mountains by means of terror, war and the manipulations of aid, is the main outcome of this policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(3) Civil war has created a catastrophe of enormous proportions in Southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains; an estimated 1.5 million have now died of starvation and disease and over 5 million have been displaced since the outbreak of the latest phase of the war in 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(4) The war has devastated the infrastructure of these regions, destroying the economic, health, education and communication systems and seriously affecting food production. The civil authorities continue to make valiant efforts to maintain essential services, but repeated mass displacement of millions of people, lack of resources, and problems of access for aid organisations, pose insuperable problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(5) Offensives by GOS forces during last year's dry season inflicted great suffering on hundreds of thousands of people in and around Nimule, Kajokeji, Thiet, the Southern Blue Nile and the Nuba Mountains. The GOS-supplied militias of Commanders Kerubino and William Nyuon have also inflicted great suffering on the peoples of Bahr El Ghazal and Eastern Equatoria, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(6) Unless this conflict is resolved as a matter of great urgency, the cost to both the people of Sudan and to the international community will be incalculable. For example, there will be even greater demands on the international agencies; growing numbers of refugees will pose even greater problems for neighboring countries; and disease will spread beyond the borders of Sudan, including new health problems with resistant pathogens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(7) The imbalance of military power in favour of the GOS perpetuates the war and decreases the prospect of a successful outcome of the IGADD peace intiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(8) Indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets (for example, the areas of Kapoeta an Nimule, January 1995) continues to increase the number of civilians who are killed, wounded and displaced. There are recent reports of large numbers of people leaving camps around Nimule (Labone and Mughale) and migrating eastwards. Many of these people had previously been displaced from their homes in the region of Bor and were resettled in the 'Triple A' camps near Nimule; they had to move again last year when these camps were over-run by GOS forces. They are therefore now suffering their third forced migration in two years. The SPLA has no adequate defence against the aerial bombardment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(9) Humanitarian aid fails to reach hundreds of thousands of victims of war and famine. The GOS continues to refuse to give access to the UN and the NGOs to SPLA-administered areas in the Nuba Mountains and to other areas such as Pariang, Nimule, Chukudum, Ikatos, Mundri, and the Southern Blue Nile Region. Denial of access means that thousands of people are dying from lack of food and medicines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(10) Many people in Sudan still suffer from gross violations of human rights. For example, there are reports of recent destruction of villages and of crops, together with the perpetration of murder and other atrocities by GOS forces in the Nuba Mountains, and many black Africans, especially women and children, are still subject to enslavement by Arabs from the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recommendations: &quot;The time is overdue for the international community to take a firm stand against the GOS's policy of attempted genocide, with the destruction of liege, culture, language, community, religion, ethnic identity and political opposition. This policy continues to create misery of unimaginable proportions and to give rise to dangerous political instability in Sudan and throughout the wider international arena. It also creating a bottomless pit of need for humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;CSI therefore again calls in the international community, can in particular the member states of the United Nations Security Council, to prevail upon the GOS to cease hostilities against the people of the South and of the Nuba Mountains; and the honour its voluntarily accepted human rights obligations to all citizens, by:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(1) Imposing an arms and oil embargo upon the GOS until it desists from trying to impose a military solution on the people of the South and the Nuba Mountains;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(2) Establishing air exclusion zones for the protection of the civilian population from aerial bombardment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(3) Continuing to support the IGADD peace initiative, and ensuring that tangible outcomes are imminently forthcoming to prevent the GOS from using these peace talks as a means of buying time to perpetuate its war attrition;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(4) Engaging in discussions with the banned democratic Opposition groups, in both the North and the South which represent over 90% of the Sudanese people;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(5) Enabling the people of the South and the Nuba Mountains to have the opportunity to determine their own future;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(6) Ensuring access by the UN's Operation Life-line Sudan (OLS) and other humanitarian aid organisations to all areas, including the Nuba Mountains. Permission to reach all areas should be permanent, as the current 'stop-go' policy adopted by the GOS results in many thousands of displaced people moving to an area which they hear is receiving supplies of food and/or medicines. If access is then denied, they become stranded, often dying of starvation of treatable disease;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(7) Providing teams of human rights monitors in the North, the Nuba Mountains and the South, under the direction of the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Sudan;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(8) Enabling the civil authorities in the South and the Nuba Mountains to develop local initiatives, such as co-operative farms, craft industries, and education/training schemes for both civilians and soldiers.  This would provide the basis for substance and an infrastructure for independence, rehabilitation and reconstruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 17, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Joyce Ozynski</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once upon a time there were two radio stations -- Springbok Radio, and the English Station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Springbok Radio was riddled with advertisements and catered to the narrow, shallow tastes of white South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Springbok Radio that, as a kid, I listened to Superman at 5 o'clock in the afternoons -- &quot;Up, up and away!&quot; and in the evenings, the spooky &quot;Creaking Door&quot; and &quot;Consider Your Verdict&quot;, a courtroom drama series in which the listener was told, &quot;You be the judge!&quot;. During the long pause filed with commercials, the listener had to decide who was the guilty party.  Only then did the judge announce his verdict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The English Stations was the only on which you could hear, without any interruptions from advertisements, classical music, poetry, and other coloniclism, only an ossified remnant of colonialism commercial radio and theAfrikaans station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not so many years ago, the SABC effected a fusion of Springbok radio with the English station. Springbok radio with in fifties went off the air and the English station wagon (renamed Radio South Africa) was now obliged to carry advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It looks as it the advertisements are here to stay, but in other respect, SABC Chief of Radio, Govin Reddy, is bent on transforming Radio South Africa into a station what will reflect on life, recognising of out last that we are part of the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You can switch on tour radios on March 1 to check out the changes yourself. Judging by what Reddy says, this could be the station that will come to the rescue of all those who want more from radio than endless pop music and endless talk shows with hosts who are often as arrogantly opinionated as the people who phone in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news and current affairs section of SAfm, as it is to be known, sounds as if it is going to be excellent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Considering the state of the newspaper industry, with its diminishing diversity of views, radio news could be a life saver -- especially as there is no good quality national morning paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reddy said that RSA had relied on prepackaged new programmes. This will change as the news is given greater immediacy by the inclusion of live interviews with people in the news. &quot;The news will be read by people who write the news. We won't be using presenters anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of the very brief on-the-hour news broadcasts, there will be &quot;lengthy news bulletins at 7 am, 8 am, 1 o'clock, 6 pm and 10 pm. The on-the-hour news broadcasts will continue but they will be longer and last for 3 to 5 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking South Africa out of the isolation of apartheid years, SAfm will carry much more African news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Channel Africa, the external service, already has a structure in place with eight other African countries, and Reddy says this is to be used to supply news materials to SAfm and the African language stations. There will be exchanges with radio in other African countries as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is not merely a question of broadening the scope. Reddy emphasises the implications for creating a well-informed public that will be able to play its part in a democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are a member of the Southern African Development Community and are involved in constructive engagement with the region. South Africa is the wealthiest country in the region and you can only do that if people are informed. For example, if South Africa gives assistance to Malawi, people must know why, must know that Malawi is one of the 10 poorest countries in the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coverage of the other African countries will not confine itself to elections, assassinations and coups, Reddy said, but will include human interest stories as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are gong to increase the coverage not only of the whole of Africa but of the world.&quot; There will be fresh young correspondents to replace the older voices, some of whom have been doing the job &quot;since the seventies, if not the sixties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The approach to current affairs will change. Radio Today will be called Newsbreak. &quot;We have a new term being trained to handle it and it will be much more lively and topical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For in-depth reporting and analysis of the week's issues, there will be a long programme on Sunday morning and a programme of interviews and analysis by Allister Sparks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAfm will play a least 50 per cent local music, but will also continue to play classical music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its aim is to introduce younger voices people of all colours and both sexes -- ending the domination of the older, white male structure. So the audience it will attack will similarly be a representative mix of the South African population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Documentaries, which have been a very weak area on RSA, will be given the attention they deserve. &quot;Radio documentaries cost a fraction of what they do on television, and I believe that social documentaries are highly relevant to the new South Africa. But we need to train people to make them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sadly, SAfm will have to continue to carry advertisements unless the government decides to step in and fund the station. &quot;We have advertising out of necessity, not choice. At the moment we get 35 per cent of out income from licenses. If the government gives us funding we will drop our advertisements.  The principle will be decided by the IBA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Surely the IBA will have the wisdom to look beyond immediate financial considerations and giver its support to the crucial principle that there should be at least one are of our culture which is free of the subtle stranglehold of advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demands of advertising do undoubtedly limit freedom of speech. Add to that the pain they cause listeners by their nagging repetition of inane messages and bad music, and there is a very good case for giving South African relief from this tyranny.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 24, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Julian Drew</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next week the controlling body of the sport, Athletics South Africa (ASA), will hold its first election since official unity was achieved more than three troubled and turbulent years ago -- and Danie Malan, Johannesburg's controversy-plagued sports supremo, is a front-runner for the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current co-president of ASA, John Ncinane, and the two co-chairmen of ASA Track and Field, Malan and Leonard Chuene, were announced this week as the three nominated candidates for the position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan, one of the most powerful and influential figures in South African sport, has been embroiled in a number of controversies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last July the Johannesburg City Council (JCC), where Malan is employed as Director of Sport, ordered an official inquiry into his conduct in handling the World Corporate Games. The charges concerned his decision to appoint a British businessman, David Teasdale, to negotiate the rights to the Games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A council committee of which Malan was a member then appointed a close corporation named Comodale SA to raise sponsors for the Games without advertising the work. Comodale's two members were Teasdale and Malan's wife, Beverley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When complaints forced councillor Cecil Bass, chairman of the council's culture and recreation committee, to demand Mrs. Malan's resignation from Comodale SA, she was then appointed as marketing director of World Corporate Games 1994. Malan was one of two directors of this company and again the position was not advertised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Games, held in October, were widely regarded as a complete flop.  The results of the inquiry were not released, however, until Judge King requested clarification from the council last month in order to clear Malan's eligibility for the ASA elections. Malan was cleared of all charges, despite the fact that the senior advocate who conducted the investigation said there was a prima facie case against him. The council, after questioning Malan further, decided to exonerate him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest dispute to embroil Malan concerns the construction of a R97-million athletics stadium in Johannesburg, which was rushed through council just before last year's parliamentary elections. Malan was again the driving force behind this project which, at the beginning, was promoted as part of Johannesburg's Olympic bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It received strong opposition from some members of the bid committee for the way it was handled. There were irregularities in the tender process for the stadium and the latest revelations show the Johannesburg Athletics Association (JAA), which has six directors including Malan, accepted a tender for the athletics track which was higher than that of a competing company.  When this was queried the council said that it was unable to interfere as the JAA was completely independent of the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'In my opinion the president of a national sporting body should not have any controversies surrounding him,&quot; said Mike Walters, co-chairman of the ASA cross country commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More forthright was Clarie Botha, the senior vice- president of Transvaal Athletics. &quot;If I look at the experiences of Transvaal then I believe unity can only be achieved if there is trust,&quot; Botha said. &quot;I think Leonard Chuene is the only person who has what it takes to achieve unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At every SA Amateur Athletics Union meeting in the last three years of its existence Danie Malan's name came up. I don't want always to have to look behind stones when dealing with somebody. I don't believe there can be unity under Malan,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I believe if something is not acceptable then people should not be afraid to say so,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before Malan came to Johannesburg in 1991 he was director of the University of Port Elizabeth's (UPE) sports bureau for 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan was in charge of organising all sports events at UPE. &quot;As the director of the sports bureau he was entitled to appoint outside promotions companies to assist with events,&quot; says Russell Sheppard, former chairman of the Eastern Province Road Running Association (EPRRA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He soon started using M&amp;M Promotions (McKenzie and Malan Promotions) and he used them openly,&quot; he says. The Malan in M&amp;M Promotions is his wife Beverley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan was certainly successful in his work, and he was soon organising a string of high profile road races and athletics meetings that had the sponsors queuing up to put their names behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EPRRA was not happy, however, and, according to Sheppard, was never paid its mandatory percentage of race entry fees by Malan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Responded Malan: &quot;I'm not aware of UPE not fulfilling its commitments (to EPRRA). In fact while I was there UPE contributed tremendously to the development of athletics in the province.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Petrus Boukes, co-chairman of EP Cross-country Commission and who is still at the sports bureau, having worked under Malan as a sports officer, says: &quot;All I can say after working with him is I will never trust him.&quot; He would not elaborate on his reasons for saying this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is up to the athletics people to decide if he's the best man for the job. If they are stupid enough to vote for him then that's their problem,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan says he is puzzled by Boukes' views and says that it was he who discovered Boukes and got him to the position he occupies today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malan also has many fans though and as former Springbok centre Eben Olivier, who also worked with Malan, says: &quot;He was always very loyal to his colleagues and his staff. He did such a lot for sport in Eastern Province, he really put it on the map.&quot; Indeed as somebody who worked closely with Malan in his early days said, &quot;He really is a very dynamic and hard working individual who has a lot to offer athletics. Its just a pity there is always this big question mark hanging over him.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Alan Reynolds, Winnie Mandela's private secretary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela's dismissal of his wife from her government post this week gives no indication of the reasoning behind his action. He has not met her personally in the matter, and so we do not even privately have his reasons for his action. Accordingly, we must presume that he dismissed her because of her trip to West Africa in February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately, that trip involved meetings with four heads of state of African countries, with 11 African ministers of culture, and was undertaken entirely in the interests of South Africa and its developing relations with West Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there have been attempts to trivialise the trip as a &quot;jaunt&quot;, there never was any question but that Mrs. Mandela undertook the trip as business of state. She was invited to Burkina Faso in her capacity as Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture, by the Minister of Culture of Burkina Faso. She accepted the invitation only after seeking the advice of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which &quot;strongly recommended&quot; that she undertake the trip for the purposes of improving bilateral relations with Burkina Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once these details had been finalised, permission for the trip was sought from the president, and received in a letter from his office dated February 15 1995. On receipt of this, the final confirmations for the visit were made with the host governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On learning on February 20 through the deputy president's office that the president had changed his mind and no longer wished her to travel, Mrs.  Mandela wrote him a detailed letter explaining exactly why the visit was important, and pointed out that it would cause great offence if appointments of this nature were suddenly canceled. She also requested a personal appointment with the president on her return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She further consulted with the chief whip of the ANC, Reverend Arnold Stofile, who pointed out the ANC had a very bad reputation for missing appointments, and that in the light of this it would be bad for the image of the ANC if she suddenly canceled a trip involving foreign heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president's office had not responded to her letter by the time Mrs. Mandela departed on her international flight to West Africa on February 23, and she left under the impression that her explanation had been accepted.  There was never any attempt or intention on her part to defy the president in the matter and, if he is at all reasonable, he must understand that. If there is any blame to be apportioned, it rests firmly with the failure of his own office to respond timeously to an urgent communication from a deputy minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The reason given for the decision by the president to withdraw his approval for the trip was that &quot;urgent discussions must take place to address issues that have been raised publicly bearing on the conduct of ministers and deputy ministers&quot;. If the president was referring to the resignation of 11 members of the ANC Women's League, I regard that reason as being of the most dubious authenticity -- Deputy President Thabo Mbeki had been deputised to deal with the Women's League matter, and Mbeki was out of the country at that time. There was thus no prospect of any meeting in this matter being successfully convened. In addition, President Mandela had been informed that the league itself had set up a conference to resolve the league issues, and that conference was scheduled for March 25 and 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to the other possible reasons, I do not think that morality is the issue, because it is a matter of public record that the benches of Parliament are not occupied exclusively by people of uniformly high moral calibre and President Mandela knows that. There are many people in Parliament, and in the Cabinet, against whom far worse allegations are made than those being made against Mrs. Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I do not think that &quot;obedience&quot; is the issue because, apart from the fact that Mrs. Mandela was not &quot;disobedient&quot;, there have been some other examples of &quot;disobedience&quot; by ministers which have not been punished by dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As to criticism of the government, that is a healthy and vital part of democracy, or is this perhaps not a democracy? And why is it only when Mrs.  Mandela criticises the government that there is reaction, and not when other members of the government do so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And I certainly do not think that &quot;good government&quot; was a concern, because if it was, the president would have agreed that a state visit by one of his deputy ministers was of far greater importance to good government than a fracas in the Women's League, for which resolution mechanisms had already been established.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Justin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Winnie Mandela may have suffered the most devastating defeat of her political career this week. Yet she has won the battle for the loyalty of the Mandela children, leaving her estranged husband -- one of the world's best-loved national leaders -- a lonely man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The clinical letter addressed to &quot;Mrs. Mandela&quot; which terminated Winnie Mandela's position in government marks a new low in relations between President Nelson Mandela and his estranged wife -- and the signs are that his daughters have shunned him too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to Winnie Mandela say that her daughters, Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane and Zenani Dhlamini, have effectively cut themselves off from their father, confirming the suspicions which arose when neither daughter chose to accompany the president when he hosted Queen Elizabeth during her state visit to South Africa last week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presence of Rochelle Mtirara as Mandela's consort has been explained in terms of their distant ties of kinship, but this does not disguise the fact that not one of his three daughters (his oldest daughter, Makaziwe, is from his first marriage) chose to make herself available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's no coincidence,&quot; said a source close to Mrs. Mandela. Ever since the bungled police raid on Mrs. Mandela's home three weeks ago, her daughters have stood firmly in support of their mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela's long period of imprisonment virtually ruled out the possibility of a close relationship with his younger daughters. Zenani was five and Zindzi three when he was incarcerated in 1963, and he was unable to see them again until they were almost adults. In such circumstances it was inevitable that the daughters' first loyalty would be to their mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, it would take more than their parents' separation to split them from their father, and Dhlamini stood at the president's side during the inauguration last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But she declined to repeat the performance for the royal visit, suggesting that relations have deteriorated badly since then. Recently, Mandela- Hlongwane gave a remarkably frank magazine interview detailing the remoteness of her father during her upbringing. The feeling in the Winnie Mandela camp is that the daughters cannot countenance what they see as unacceptable treatment endured by their mother in the weeks leading up to her dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela's autobiography provides some telling clues to the nature of his relationship with Winnie Mandela and her daughters. For 21 years, all his conversations with his wife took place through a glass screen.  For two years in the 1960s, the couple was denied a meeting altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their relationship was sustained by the photographs which Nelson Mandela cherished, and the letters which, more often than not, arrived shredded by the prison censors. Nelson Mandela writes in his autobiography about one such letter which was inspired by a plant which withered and died in the garden that he cultivated on Robben Island: &quot;I did not want our relationship to go the way of that plant, and yet I felt I had been unable to nourish many of the most important relationships in my life. Sometimes there is nothing one can do to save something that must die.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His delight in his family together with his sense of distance from them is poignantly expressed in his account of his first meeting with his daughter Zindzi since her infancy: &quot;I was delighted to behold what a beautiful woman my youngest daughter had become and how closely she resembled her equally beautiful mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Zindzi was shy and hesitant at first. I am sure it was not easy for her finally to see a father she had never really known, a father who could love her only from a distance, who seemed to belong not to her but to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's unconditional loyalty to his wife and daughters, born of their artificial relationship during the prison years, continued for the first few years after his release. He took a considerable political risk in standing by Winnie Mandela during her trial on charges of kidnapping in 1991.  Even after her conviction, Mandela wrote that &quot;as far as I was concerned, verdict or no verdict, her innocence was not in doubt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet such unstinting loyalty could not weather the political realities which were driving the couple further apart, culminating in the announcement of their separation in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president also does not enjoy a close relationship with Makgatho and Makaziwe, the children of his first wife, Evelyn, from whom he separated in 1955. The reasons for the separation are emblematic of the way in which the struggle has always come between Mandela and a happy personal life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'She gave me an ultimatum,&quot; Mandela writes. &quot;I had to choose between her and the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the same chapter Mandela admits that Makgatho and Makaziwe were traumatised by this split. One source close to the family suggested that these older children, now in their forties and established in successful careers, have had difficulty dealing with the paternalistic attitude which their father finds hard to avoid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When your life is the struggle, as mine was, there is little room left for family,&quot; Mandela writes in his autobiography. &quot;That has always been my greatest regret, and the most painful aspect of the choice I made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is only with the struggle behind him that Mandela now faces the full consequences of that choice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A commission set up this week to probe Thor Chemicals' importation of toxic waste to South Africa may be presented with evidence of links between employees of the British multinational and a covert weapons programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Environmental Justice Network Forum (EJNF), a coalition of environmental groups, this week said it feared the commission would not be able to probe &quot;very serious matters&quot; regarding Thor's past activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But commission chairman Dennis Davis said he would investigate all evidence regarding Thor's past activities in South Africa even though its main task is to finds ways of dealing with a stockpile of toxic waste on Thor's premises in the Natal Midlands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will interpret our terms of reference broadly. Whatever evidence comes up, we will have to examine that,&quot; said Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was responding to complaints from EJNF that terms of reference for the commission, gazetted this week, contained stringent secrecy clauses that pointed to the possibility of a &quot;sinister effort to cover up and prevent the discovery of very serious matters&quot;. can cut from here</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Davis said the secrecy clauses were part of the standard procedures for commissions of inquiry and would not prevent his team from making a thorough and public probe into Thor's controversial history in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The terms of reference for the probe, set up by Environment Minister Dawie de Villiers, are to &quot;investigate the history and background of the acquisition of spent mercury catalyst stock by Thor&quot; and &quot;recommend the best practical environmental option to deal with the problem&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thor has been accused of polluting ground water and the atmosphere around with large amounts of mercury toxins that emanate from a smelter on its plant at Cato Ridge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The families of two workers who died at the factory, allegedly after being exposed to massive levels of hazardous gases, are suing the company for damages in a British court. A hearing to decide whether the civil action should be heard in England or South Africa begins in London next week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 24, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Justin Pearce</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people from Namaqualand didn't wave flags to greet Queen Elizabeth on her arrival in Cape Town on Monday. They waved placards. The only obviously dissenting voices in the crowd, they had traveled 500km or more to remind her of a promise broken by Elizabeth's great- great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, and to try to enlist royal help in their struggle for land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The members of the Namaqualand Civic Association had written to the queen requesting a meeting, but when they were informed that this could not be fitted into her schedule, they decided to demonstrate. The letter they sent to the queen points out that Queen Victoria had promised protection to the people of Namaqualand in the 19th century, and had then betrayed them by giving away their land to &quot;foreign intruders&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We understand that the British Crown and the British Government no longer have any say over what happens in our country, but we know that because of the nature of the position and that of your government it would be possible for you to use your great influence to advance our cause,&quot; the letter reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> British High Commission representative Nigel Casey said the British government was still waiting for a formal submission by the Namaqualanders before deciding whether to intervene on their behalf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation of the Namaqualanders is complicated by the fact that they have no obvious recourse to the Land Claims Court which, in terms of its founding legislation, is concerned only with claims on land that was taken after the promulgation of the Land Act in 1913.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coincidentally, the day of the protest also saw a case in which De Beers Consolidated Mines won a court order declaring itself to be the rightful owner of four disputed tracts of land near Steinkopf in Namaqualand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The land, which was purchased by De Beers from a private seller in the 1940s, is claimed by the Steinkopf community who are the descendents of the people who were alienated from the land in the last century. When De Beers announced their intention to sell the land by public auction, the Steinkopf Management Board raised objections concerning the company's claim to the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Beers eventually sought the declaratory order in the Cape Supreme Court to clarify the ownership of the land before going ahead with the sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers acting for the Steinkopf Transitional Local Authority (the successor to the management board) argued the case on the basis of aboriginal tenure. According to Sue Power of the Surplus People's Project, aboriginal tenure had not previously been invoked in a legal case in South Africa, and the community had not been optimistic about winning the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Wallace Ngoqi, land claims commissioner for the Northern and Western Cape, points out there is still legal space for the Steinkopf community and other Namaqualanders to submit claims to the Land Claims Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He points out a clause in the Land Restitution Act which allows the commission to make recommendations to the minister of land affairs concerning land which falls outside the immediate terms of reference of the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the commission and the minister agree that there is some merit in the claimants' case, the issue could be resolved by means of negotiation between the claimants and the current owners of the land.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 24, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jacques Santer, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First of all, I would like to express our profound appreciation to you Mr. President, to the European Commission and to the G-7 ministers present here for inviting us to address the opening session of this important Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also bring to the Conference the greetings of our President Nelson Mandela who, similarly, asked us to convey both the best wishes of the people of South Africa to the Conference and our gratitude that you selected our country to sit in on your discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that by this act you sought to make the critical point that entry into the information society is not reserved for the G-7 members and other developed countries- that the debate about the information society is of relevance to all humanity and therefore cannot ignore the position, the needs and role of the developing world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The truth of this proposition is self-evident. We are sincerely moved that you, Mr President, by inviting me to address the opening session of this Conference, began in a practical way to bring the developing world into the global debate on the information society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With regard to information and communication, we are all witnesses to an extraordinary technological revolution which offers ever more powerful and astonishing capabilities, affecting, primarily in the developed world, traditional patterns of work, public opinion, entertainment, education and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These technological developments once more serve to highlight, emphasise and further enhance the disparities between the developed and the developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of us present in this room know that, for instance, access to basic telephony is far from being a reality in many parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than half of humanity has never made a telephone call. There are more telephone lines in Manhattan than in all of sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also see similar disparities within our own country- between the developed and the underdeveloped parts of our society. In the city of Durban, for instance, telephone penetration among white households stands at 75 per cent. In contrast it stands at 2 per cent as far as the Black households are concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given these disparities, it is clear that bringing the developing world on to the Information Super-Highway constitutes a colossal challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have to address this challenge nevertheless, if we are to promote economic growth and development world wide, consolidate democracy and human rights, increase the capacity of ordinary people to participate in governance, encourage resolution of conflicts by negotiation rather than war and do what has to be done to enable all to gain access to the best in human civilisation, within the common neighbourhood in which we all live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In our own country, having recognised the critical importance and role of information and communication, we began, before our elections last year, to take an intensive look at this whole area, including the question of further building our information and communication infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result of these early studies and discussions among the various stockholders in our country, the construction of this infrastructure has been determined as one of the important policy objectives of our Reconstruction and Development Programme, which aims to achieve the fundamental and all-round renewal of our society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is of course very true that the new democratic government has a whole range of pressing problems to attend to. These include such issues as job creation, housing, provision of clean water and adequate sanitation, education and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is however also clear that we need a vastly expanded and modern information and communication infrastructure to help us address these concerns, which helps to emphasise the urgency of attending to what, at first glance, might seem to be something to which we should give less priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me therefore state five principles which guide our own approach to these matters of communication and information which this Conference is discussing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First- the information infrastructure must serve as a means to support our goals of reconstruction and development. In this context we are convinced that information and communication technologies constitute an engine for economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As such, these technologies will, among other things, encourage growth within our boundaries and facilitate the further insertion of our economy into the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is obviously on the basis of a growing and dynamic economy that we will be able to address, on a sustainable basis, the pressing needs I have mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second principle I would like to mention concerns the region of Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We strongly believe that any initiative the purpose of which is to build and modernise our information and communication infrastructure must be situated within the context of the needs of the Southern African region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional integration is key to our approach and is an objective which all the peoples of our region have seized upon because it is both possible and necessary. This must also encompass the area of information and communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third principle I would like to mention is that we must adopt a global approach. It seems clear to us that building our information and communication infrastructure is a multi-faceted proposition in the sense that it encompasses economic, financial, technological, social, cultural and moral aspects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consequently, the solution to these problems must itself be global in nature, cutting across the traditional segments of the information and communication industry and bringing within its scope social and cultural concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fourth principle concerns the issue of content. Like all developing countries, we are very keen to acquire and grasp the technologies which enable people and institutions to access astronomical processing, storage, retrieval and delivery capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But we are also extremely interested to ensure that we are not mere importers and consumers of a predetermined content. Rather, we also want to be producers and exporters and therefore active and significant participants in the creation, production and formulation of content, including news, educational and cultural programmes, games, movies, songs, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To give an indication of what we can by all this- we believe that the modern communication technology we are all talking about must help us educate our children, particularly in the rural and other underdeveloped areas of our country, teach our medical workers and parents how to care for babies, train our youth and eliminate distance and infrastructure imbalances which act as a barrier in providing these social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fifth principle we would like to mention concerns the issue of international co-operation. It is again quite clear that the building of our information and communication infrastructure offers a unique opportunity to enhance international co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we have said, we believe that this initiative must be global in nature and involve a great variety of actors, from investors, financiers and manufacturers to operators, educators, artists and so on, drawing into the global project both the domestic and the international, both South Africans and the peoples of the world, both ourselves and the participants at this Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our late entry into the democratic world order has given us the opportunity to take on board exciting new concepts about governance. I refer here in particular to what is described as the participation of civil society in such governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we draft our new constitution and establish new institutions of government, our eyes are focused on the concept of what we have described as a people-centered society. This requires that the people themselves must be empowered to intervene in the decision-making process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this to become a reality, the masses must be able to read, write and to count and be informed on a global basis, that is to say, not only about the plans of government but at the same time about the situation in their immediate neighbourhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people must not only be the recipients of communication from the rulers but should also be able to make their voices heard within the committees in which the rulers sit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that this radical expansion of the frontiers of democratic participation cannot but enhance the legitimacy of the democratic state, tap the initiative and intellect of millions of citizens, limit any tendency towards arbitrary rule and reinforce social stability and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of this can be achieved without recourse to the information and communication infrastructure we have been talking about - hence our keenness to move in practical ways towards joining the Information Super-Highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without, in any way, overestimating our own capabilities, and in the context of what we have said about the integration of the region of Southern Africa, we believe that South Africa can act as one of the bridging societies with regard to the realisation of the common objective of bringing together, in a mutually benefical way, the interests, the assets and the aspirations of the developing world and the technological and financial capacities that reside in the developed world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this context, I would like to say that our government is already considering various concrete proposals relating to the information and communication infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These proposals include the possibility to lay a fibre optic cable encompassing the whole continent of Africa, the extension of the telephone network to rural and underdeveloped areas of South Africa, and a project sponsored by an international consortium which addresses our information and communication needs on a global, rather than a piecemeal basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all these instances, we would look forward to the participation, on the basis of partnership, of the private sector represented at this Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other things, adequate regulatory frameworks would have to address the all-important issue of ensuring that the developing world does not enter the Information Super-Highway as a second-class road user.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, where the flow of information and cultural products on the information super-highway will originate mostly from the developed North, this naturally becomes a cause of concern to relatively less media-intensive cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I strongly believe that censorship and control are not an appropriate way to deal with these worries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best insurance against the swamping of people's cultures is the re-invigoration of their creative spirit and universal appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We, in the developing world, have much to contribute and the super-highway should usher in an era where this contribution ultimately binds human kind closer together and enables all to shape our common destiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This leads me to the last point I would like to make. We believe that this initiative, which has brought us to Brussels, needs to be followed by another one, bringing together a cross section of the developing world together with the G-7 Group and the European Union, in recognition of the global information and communication challenge, to exchange views on such questions as strategy, finance and international m-ordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We trust that the distinguished President of the European Union, our host on this occasion, will find time to consider this proposal and perhaps agree to sponsor what we believe would be an important and necessary encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am certain that our own country, if called upon, would seriously consider the possibility of hosting such a Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Please accept our best wishes for the success of this Conference and our thanks for you attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New Nation (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JAnuary 27, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa has in the past prided itself on the fact that it spends as much as anyone else in the world on health care - about two percent of the total wealth produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also boasts some of the best equipped hospitals in the Southern Hemisphere and, for some, state of the art health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What it cannot boast, however, is equal access to health care for all its citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only 19 percent of the country's estimated 40 million citizens have ready access to quality primary health care - largely thanks to funding through private medical schemes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On average, most medical aid members belong to an above average income group, earning about R40 000 a year or around R3 000 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remaining 81 percent or 32 million people are not covered by medical aid because they are unemployed or simply because they do not earn enough to afford exorbitant premiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They depend entirely on state hospitals and clinics for primary health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The picture gets more depressing when one considers that these 32 million depend almost entirely on only 5 000 general practitioners employed by state-funded health facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, the seven to eight million medical aid members have access to 8 000 GPs operating in the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a ratio of doctors to patients in the private affluent sector of 1:1 000 compared to 1:6 400 in the publicly-funded sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This imbalance translates into a back-breaking burden for overcrowded state-funded hospitals, which have been driven close to collapse with the quality of specialist medical services deteriorating at an alarming rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is amply apparent is that the country's health care system needs dramatic restructuring. But consensus on how to achieve this continues to elude interest groups in the health sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zuma is adamant that a solution must be found. She is convinced that the focus must be on developing a system that removes the responsibility of providing primary health care from hospitals and makes it universally accessible and affordable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The core of any successful health care system is strong primary care - ie, a basic health service for all,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate spin-off will be an improvement in the quality of specialist care at hospitals while the cost of providing primary health care would be reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What seems obvious though, is that accessibility will not increase unless government is able to make the services offered by the 8 000 GPs available to all and not just those who can afford it through private medical aid and insurance schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health economist Jonathan Deeble says in a proposal prepared for the health ministry that this could be achieved by involving these GPs in a national scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would immediately increase the number of GPs available to the estimated 32 million dependent on state facilities from the current 5 000 to 13 000 and spread the ratio of one doctor for every 64 000 to one doctor for every 3 000 citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, one of the most serious obstacles in the way of drawing GPs into a national scheme is limited financial resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It seems highly unlikely that government will in the short term be able to find additional funds to pay the 8 000 doctors who currently have 70 percent of their services financed through private medical aid schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pointing to an added difficulty, Deeble says, &quot;There would be little chance of attracting GPs into a national programme at affordable prices as long as their present practices are well supported by medical aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proposals for a NHI scheme have come in for criticism from free marketeers who have slammed the proposal as an attempt to smuggle in a socialist health care scheme that is bound to fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They point to Britain, where market reforms were introduced into a national health scheme which had been operating for more than 40 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been pointed out that the introduction of o system similar to that proposed by Deeble also sparked off an exodus of GPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Zuma says the British system continues to work very well and has done so for 40 years. &quot;Yes, right at the beginning some doctors left, but the scheme worked and they soon came back,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the market reforms recently introduced in Britain, Zuma says: &quot;Any scheme that has been operating for such a length of time as in Britain has to be re-evaluated from time to time as conditions change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What needs to be said, however, is that almost all developed countries are introducing some national health scheme in one form or another - including Switzerland, which recently held a referendum and people voted for a national health insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Taiwan, also for the first time this year, is implementing a national health insurance scheme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is certain from recent criticism of a national health plan controlled exclusively by government and which bars medical aid funds from collecting premiums for primary health care, is that its implementation could generate a great deal of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is possible that when government finalises its plans for a NHI, it will provide for a gradual move from a hybrid scheme offering both government and private sector involvement, to eventually developing a completely state-run primary health service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (This is a piece submitted by David Newbury of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. He notes these thoughts will be expanded in the future.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dramas in Central Africa continue unabated, though off the TV screens. In Rwanda, while the &quot;international community&quot; and the aid agencies focus on the &quot;two&quot; sides, the RPF (the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the leading party in the current government of Kigali) and the FAR (&quot;Les Forces Armees Rwandaises,&quot; the former Rwandan Army under the Habyarimana regime). However, the vast majority of people -- the Third Force -- are partisan of neither political faction at this point. But despite the focus of outside observers, the multiple crises will not diminish until the re-invention of Rwandan society has begun anew -- from the bottom up. One facet to that process is seen in an exploration of the relation of gender and genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many ways in which the two--gender and genocide--are inter-related. But three dimension seem worthy of note. In the immediate wake of genocide both the FAR and the RPF rounded up young women and kept them as incubators of a new generation, in what amounted to a race to propagate -- with both sides feeling their political clout (and eventually military potential) depended directly on their demographic weight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a sense this amounts to a new dimension of an earlier social strategy. In the past in Rwanda demographic weight was valued because it allowed the potential of multiple alliances through various types of client ties. Now demographic weight is used as a means to build up the potential of the factional group precisely to be independent of the kind of intricate social networks and broadly-ramifying client ties that characterized earlier social relations. The ethnicity of the women so captured was apparently no obstacle to this strategy, since in the eyes of the ideologues on both sides -- who have increasingly adopted an essentialist view of culture and ethnicity -- ethnicity is determined by paternity alone. But where during the genocidal atrocities, many Tutsi women were raped to humiliate and harm them (and they were often killed afterward), in this later phase after the atrocities, the preference was for women of the same ethnic group as the perpetrators, both Hutu and Tutsis, this time to reproduce the group. For example, stories from reliable sources -- independently confirmed -- tell of young Tutsi women being held in Kigali and other towns by RPF forces (composed mostly of Tutsi) as walking wombs, where the yearnings of youth mix with the strategies of statesmen to capture women of reproductive age -- especially women of one's own ethnicity. So rather than fighting to &quot;protect&quot; women of the same ethnicity as the soldiers, to recall the paternalistic/patriarchal cliche about war, in this case the fighting has ended up by conquering women of the same group as the soldiers, often explicitly referred to as &quot;le repos du guerrier&quot; -- spoils of the victor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second dimension to the role of gender in the current conditions relates to legal, as well as personal security. Both in the refugee camps outside the country and in the camps of displaced peoples within Rwanda, a very large number of women -- of diverse ages -- are now heads of families.  But this presents grave difficulties for them in gaining access to land or property within a patriarchal legal system -- and, as in the wake of many wars, a chauvinistic social context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The legal situation pertaining to women and property, and specifically to the right of women to inherit and own land is ambiguous, for the Legal Code of Rwanda was in the process of revision when the war broke out.  Recently there have been efforts by some in the Kigali administration to clarify such rights; it is estimated that currently 65-75% of the adult population in Rwanda are female, and a significant proportion of households are headed by women. But in the aftermath of genocide where so many of those currently in power lost close family members to horrible deaths, and without any semblance of a credible judicial system in place in Rwanda, to enforce the law, such legal guarantees are often without merit. Instead, with the influx of many people (and many cattle), with the spirit of vengeance running high, and with a climate of accumulation reigning supreme during this &quot;window of opportunity&quot; where power and patronage have supplanted legal claims to ownership and property, there is very little security offered to an independent female head of household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What this means is that many families in the refugee camps outside Rwanda virtually cannot return to Rwanda, absent either male protection or effective legal rights in a social situation characterized in many instances by simple propriety predation. How are a woman and her children to claim land in the hills? Or housing in the towns? Even people who remained in the countryside have had to cede property and housing to incoming arrivals with powerful patrons. So vast numbers of female-headed families, in the refugee camps and elsewhere, wait in limbo for some effective policy to be implemented within Rwanda. It has been a long time coming, and there is no sign that the situation will change soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For many, it is not a question of &quot;guilt&quot; or &quot;propaganda&quot; that keeps them in the refugee camps outside Rwanda, as the outside world is constantly told. Intimidation and propaganda are intense, to be sure. But such propaganda gains credibility by the fact that it contains a partial truth: that security, both over the person and the land, is not yet assured. And among these several million refugees, there are many who reject the propaganda, who see it for what it is: these are not &quot;dumb peasants,&quot; puppets, as some would have us believe, but shrewd actors, who have heard their share of promises and can judge for themselves where there interests lie. Their reluctance to return -- something many desperately want to be able to do -- is simply a realistic assessment on the part of the participants, and in large number they are women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But -- and this is the third dimension to gender and genocide -- they have been largely indivisible. While currently UNHCR personnel are actively involved in encouraging women's organizations, for example, it took a long time coming, time that was critical for the emerging political culture of the camps. Neither the new powers in Kigali nor the UN -- at least in their higher levels -- were very sensitive to gender realities in the early stages.  For example, four months after the establishment of the principle refugee camp in Tanzania, the UN authorities and AID organizations were apparently unaware that there had existed formal women's organization's in every Commune, in nearly every Secteur, in Rwanda before the genocide. They were unaware too that these &quot;foyers sociaux&quot; had often been reconstituted by the women in the refugee camps; yet these women were moving ahead on women's projects where they could -- collective childcare, firewood collection, health issues, care for the aged or the wounded -- not just through informal friendship networks alone, but as organized collectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There would have been many ways a small assistance from the NGOs could have helped, yet by August 1994, at the time my wife and I visited Benaco, little had been done; the camp authorities, though extremely dedicated aid workers, were totally unaware of such activities among the refugee community, being fixated instead on issues of personal security and the &quot;politics&quot; of the refugees; these are crucially important issues, of that there is no question, but not the universe of what makes a life, let alone a community.  The neglect of such local-level initiatives as the women showed was particularly disappointing if one's goal is a functioning society and a peaceful one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One example shows how a little aid could have helped. In one camp, the women sought to harvest reeds for mats to protect their compounds during the dry season -- and as an income generator for female headed households; these delicate mats keep the dust down, provide shade, and bring beauty to what is otherwise the drab decor of a refugee camp. But when the women sought to harvest such reeds on their own, they had been chased away by the local population, who feared the loss of yet another resource to the huge influx of refugees. Discreet help with outside mediation could have made a significant difference for both the women entrepreneurs and the local population, both reducing tension and perhaps providing some compensation to the local population. There are many ways this could have been accomplished: by paying for harvest rights for refugee women; by having the local population harvest the reeds and sell them in the refugee camps, or by simply providing the reeds through UN/NGO funds. (The first alternative would have been best, for the women who weave the mats prefer to cut and dry the reeds themselves as part of the work process.) It wouldn't have taken much; nothing was done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The important point is that the UN/NGOs could have helped in the negotiations with local people to allow some form of access to marsh reeds, and thus both ease tensions and provide a valuable resource and activity validating women's grass-roots initiatives and organization through remunerative work. This is only one small example of many. But it is from such small beginnings that other initiatives flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today the situation is much different. Current activities on these issues seem to recognize that to neglect women's initiatives and to deny the chance for independent production or organization is to discount an extremely important element of this &quot;Third Force,&quot; on which any resolution ultimately depends. It is an encouraging start, but there is a long way yet to go.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> )March 13, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Sam Olukoya</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Saro-Wiwa, president of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People, MOSOP, and four others standing trial for the murder of four prominent Ogoni citizens, have lost their battle for bail. Ibrahim Auta, chairman of the three-man tribunal trying them, ruled last Monday in Port Harcourt that the accused persons were not entitled to bail because there was no guarantee that they would not abscond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their application for bail late last month, two of the accused persons, Saro-Wiwa and Ledun Mitee, deputy president of MOSOP, argued that they were responsible people unlikely to jump bail or interfere with police investigations. In an affidavit to support his application for bail, Saro-Wiwa had said his health would deteriorate as long as he remained in detention. He said his heart disease is a serious ailment which can only be treated in a teaching hospital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mitee had also cited his poor health as one of the grounds for bail.  His health, he said, had worsened while the life of his pregnant wife was in danger because of the anxiety caused by his continued detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also last Monday, the tribunal ruled on the contentious issue of where the accused persons are to be detained in the absence of bail. Auta turned down prayers by defense lawyers that the accused persons be transferred from the custody of the military where they are currently being kept to the Port Harcourt prison. In his ruling, Auta said MOSOP members might raid the prison and release the detainees if they were kept there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gani Fawehinmi, one of the defence lawyers, had objected to the detention of the accused persons in a military barracks when he raised the issue before the tribunal early last month. &quot;What is the business of the army in this matter?&quot; he queried, insisting that in the history of the judiciary, never had an accused person been kept in the custody of the army. He also spoke of the maltreatment meted out to the accused persons in the barracks.  Citing the case of Saro-Wiwa as an example, he said the MOSOP president was put in chains for 64 days and beaten up during the period. Another key complaint against their detention in the barracks was that they were denied access to their doctors, lawyers and relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Fawehinmi raised fresh issues before the tribunal. He said the prosecution has been taking its witnesses to the witness box without allowing the defence lawyers to see their statements to the police. Such a procedure, he said, was of section 236 of the Criminal; Procedure Act, but also against the rule of natural justice. Fawehinmi threatened to hands off the case if the prosecution does not change its strategy. The decision of the tribunal, he said, would determine whether he should continue as a defence lawyer in the case or not. J.B, Dawodu, the prosecutor, however, appeared unwilling to change his stance. He said to make the statements of the witnesses available to the defence following Fawehinmi's threat would mean that &quot;the prosecution has succumbed to the blackmail of the defence counsels.&quot; The prosecution has so far presented two of its witnesses before the tribunal. Their testimonies centered on MOSOP's activities especially its campaign against environmental degradation caused by oil exploration in Ogoniland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Garrick Leton, one time minister of education, was one of the two witnesses who have testified against the MOSOP. Incidentally, Leton was the first president of MOSOP when it was formed on August 26, 1990 after the Ogonis launched the Ogoni Bill of Rights. Leton described MOSOP as anon-violent organisation which adopted a philosophy of passive resistance and persuasion rather than violence. He said he resigned his position as president following Saro-Wiwa's adamant posture of not allowing the Ogonis to take a part in the June 12, 1993 presidential election. He said Saro-Wiwa resorted to unorthodox activities shortly after he succeeded him as MOSOP president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 27,1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Nats Agbo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At 11.00 A.M. March 13, four police officers drove into the Ota home of Olusegun Obasanjo, a general and former head of state. The four-man team was led by an assistant inspector-general of police. They met Obsanjo in his brick house and introduced themselves to him. They told the general he was wanted for questioning at the State Intelligence and Investigation Bureau, SIIB, in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obasanjo spoke briefly with one of his aides and was driven out in a Mercedes Benz car. Outside the gate, more security men waited in an unmarked Peugeot J5 bus. As soon as the Mercedes Benz car conveying him was out of the compound, the bus followed it. About one kilometre away, there was a lorry-load of anti-riot policemen who joined the convoy. Obasanjo was taken to the SIIB offices where he was kept until midnight. He was then transferred, according to sources, to a guest house in Ikeja.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence headquarters feigned ignorance of Obasanjo's arrest. Fred Chijuka, a brigadier-general and defense spokesman, said that since he was arrested by the police the military could not explain why or where he was being held. He told reporters: &quot;I have not been officially informed about Obasanjo's arrest. I read it in the papers like everyone of you.&quot; He directed journalists to the police for information on the arrest of the former head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; has learnt that Obasanjo's arrest did not surprise him and some of his close associates. According to dependable &quot;Newswatch&quot; sources, information had leaked from security circles indicating that he was to be arrested on his return from Copenhagen, Denmark, where he was attending a United Nations conference on the elimination of poverty from the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An aide of the general told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that Walter Carrington, the United States ambassador in Nigeria, who heard of the plan to arrest Obasanjo phoned him in Copenhagen. He reportedly told him of a rumour circulating in Nigeria that he escaped from the country through the Seme border because of a coup plot that had just been uncovered. The ambassador reportedly pleaded with him to postpone his return to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obasanjo is said to have told Carrington that he would return to Nigeria because he had no hand in any coup plot. As soon as the conference ended, Obasanjo headed home through London on a British Airways flight. On arrival at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos, March 13, his international passport was seized by security men. He was, however, allowed to go home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The seizure of his passport gave Obasanjo the first real hint that trouble was awaiting his return from Denmark. Later in the morning, he went for a meeting with the Ooni of Ife, Oba Okunade Sijuade, at the Ooni's house in Ikeja. David Jemibewon, a retired major-general, and one other person were in attendence. The meeting, &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt, discussed mainly national issues, including the rumour of Obasanjo's imminent arrest and his experience at the airport the previous night. After the meeting which lasted more than two hours, he returned to his Ota farm home. And trouble came to the general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been no love lost between Obasanjo and the Abacha administration. His detention, according to sources, climaxed the love-hate relationship. When Abacha took over November 17, 1993, he invited Obasanjo to Defense House, Lagos, to seek his cooperation and for Obasanjo to nominate candidates for cabinet and other positions. Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, a retired general and Obasanjo's former deputy, was equally invited. As reported by &quot;Newswatch&quot; at the time, both Obasanjo and Yar'Adua, who did not even know that the two of them were invited to Defence House for the same purpose, told Abacha separately that they could not give him their support unless he was ready to announce his political transition programme for the country, stating his handing over date. The stance of the two generals was said to have so angered the head of state he decided to shut them out of Aso Rock when he eventually moved to Abuja.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that Abacha appealed to close friends of Obasanjo to get him to change his mind. One of such dignitaries is President Nicephore Soglo of the Republic of Benin. A few weeks before Obasanjo left for Copenhagen, he was in Cotonou for a world conference on corruption. There, Soglo told him of Abacha's complaints that he did not support the head of state. Obasanjo told Soglo he had nothing against Abacha but that unless Abacha comes up with a clear programme to move Nigeria forward and announce a hand over date, he would not support him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yar'Adua too has campaigned openly for an early return to civil rule.  He is a member of the constitutional conference. He and some other members of the conference spearheaded the decision that Abacha must hand over by January 1996. During the long break of the conference this year, government put pressure on conference delegates to change the decision. Agents of the government were said to have distributed money and plots of land to some of the delegates. Yar'Adua was believed to have also stepped up his campaign to ensure that the conference decision was not changed. This, Aso Rock sources say, angered senior government officials who started spreading rumour that Yar'Adua was planning to topple the government. Late in February, a delegate, however, pleaded with Kaita not to tell Yar'Adua. The general is Kaita's cousin. Kaita said he was aware of the implications of the allegation being made against Yar'Adua and that he could not keep it from him. The retired general made desperate efforts to meet Abacha on the allegation. That meeting did not take place before Yar'Adua was picked up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even when the two generals were arrested, no one suspected that it had anything to do with the alleged coup plot. The military had said that Obasanjo's arrest was a police affair, ruling out any involvement of him in any coup plot. As for Yar'Adua, his detention order by Ibrahim Coomassie, the inspector-general of police, accused him of &quot;acts prejudicial to state security&quot; and of contributing to &quot;the economic adversity of the state.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two generals were arrested by policemen not soldiers. Usually, suspected coup plotters, whether they are soldiers or civilians are arrested by soldiers because coup plotting is a purely military affair. Also, their detention in civil establishments was also an indication that they were not held in connection with he coup plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But all these look like wrong signals. Late last weekend, military intelligence sources said the arrests were indeed linked to the coup plot.  Two of the senior officers arrested in connection with he coup plot were said to have made conflicting statements on the involvement of Obasanjo and Yar'Adua. According to the sources, while one of them said the two retired generals knew of the plot and were indeed ready to finance it, the other officer said it was false. The second officer was said to have claimed responsibility for the coup plot saying it was ridiculous to accuse any retired army officer of complicity in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, according to a military source, &quot;most of the revelations confirmed what we have suspected all along, that the generals were up to some mischief.&quot; &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that since 1993 when the two retired officers refused to support the government they had been placed under close security surveillance. Obasanjo, for instance, was said to have been closely monitored by security agents because of his utterances and political activities which are said to be &quot;inimical to the interest of the state.&quot; During their brief meeting in November 1993, Obasanjo told Abacha that the administration should have a brief tenure, not exceeding 18 months. He also suggested that the cabinet both at the federal and state levels, should be made of civilians.  His argument was that this would mollify the civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not quite a week after, Obasanjo openly chastised the administration at the launching of a collection of his speeches at the Ota Forum lectures in Lagos, November 24, 1993. Apparently referring to the government's claim that Ernest Shonekan resigned as head of the interim national government, ING, he asked the military to be honest in dealing with those whom they lead. He said any resignation &quot;procured at gun point is different from normal voluntary resignation,&quot; adding, &quot;it would have enhanced the credibility and honesty of purpose of our new military leaders to inform us that the resignation on which their existence is based is at least an induced resignation. Openness, honesty and accountability should be in an open inventory of Nigeria's stocks, what is sold, to whom, and at what price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His role in the formation of the National Unity Organisation of Nigeria, NUON, and the planned alliance between the Yoruba and the Igbo were viewed along the same line. Defence sources also claimed last week that the coup suspect who linked the former head of state to the coup plot said he had pledged full to the coup plotters and was presented with two options, if the coup succeeded. The first option was for him to head an interim national government for a period of two years. He would use the period to conduct elections and hand over power to an elected civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second option was the installation of Moshood Abiola, who is believed to have won the annulled June 12, 1993, presidential election, as president. He too would be in office for two years. Under the second option, all the sacked civilian governors and legislators at both the national and state levels would have been recalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military sources also claim that Yar'Adua preferred the Abiola one because it would have been easier for him to realise his ambition of becoming president. A two-year one-term tenure for Abiola would have meant that the south would have taken the first slot in the rotational presidency proposed by the constitutional conference. He would have been free to contest election after the expiration of Abiola's tenure because it would have been the turn of the northern states to produce a president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yar'Adua was also said to have exhibited so much contempt for the present military government that he often assured political associates that it would not last beyond February this year. Intelligence sources said that even in detention, Yar'Adua continued to berate the military regime, asking Abacha to leave office and hand-over power to an elected government. So far, only Yar'Adua is said to have made any statement to the police. Obasanjo, the sources said, is yet to be interviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our intelligence sources also claimed that the coup plotters had the support of the United States embassy in Lagos. An economic blueprint was said to have been prepared for the coup plotters by the embassy. The sources said the economic blueprint was to be used by the interim government to revive the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But an embassy official who requested not to be named described it as &quot;fabrication and cheap propaganda.&quot; He said: &quot;no official of the US embassy prepared any economic blueprint for any succeeding government in Nigeria.  There is no truth whatsoever to it and we had no knowledge whatsoever about plans to overthrow the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A close associate of Obasanjo also faulted the allegations made against him, saying if the former head of state was connected with the plot, &quot;he would not have returned from his trip to Denmark since he was informed of government's plans to arrest him.&quot; The associate also described as false the claim that he had accepted to serve as head of state for an interim period of two years. &quot;Those making that wild allegation seem to have forgotten that when attempts were made to persuade him to head the interim national government, ING, in the dying days of the Babangida regime, he refused. How do they expect him to accept the same position now and under criminal circumstances?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, contrary to claims by intelligence sources that Yar'Adua was making inflammatory statements about the government at the Kirikiri maximum prison where he is being held, his political associates who visited him said &quot;anybody who links him to a coup plot is out to cause mischief.&quot; He is said to see his arrest as a price for his political conviction, and told those who visited him that every one knows that he has the ambition to become president of Nigeria in a democratic set-up. He reportedly said he could not support any military coup d'etat because it negates the political ideals for which he had stood since 1979. His political allies say that his arrest was to remove him from the constitutional conference in order to diminish his influence there and create an enabling environment for the extension of the tenure of the constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether such postulations are right or not, the arrests of Obasanjo and Yar'Adua have sparked off angry reactions from the international community and some organisations within Nigeria. The US department of state March 14 warned that government should avoid actions &quot;that could be construed as outside the bounds of international norms.&quot; The statement also appealed for &quot;freedom for citizens to exchange views freely both in public and without fear of reprisal or retribution for the opinions expressed.&quot; It said the fresh wave of arrests and the continued incarceration of Abiola showed the extension of &quot;the unwise practice of silencing critics of military rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shridath Ramphal, former secretary-general of the Commonwealth, told a News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, correspondent that the arrest of serving and retired officers was alarming and resentful. He said just as the lives of those arrested were at stake, &quot;so is Nigeria's standing in the world as well as that of Africa of which Nigeria is so much a leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some European nations are said to be considering the imposition of stiff sanctions against Nigeria. Last week's cancellation by FIFA of Nigeria's hosting rights for the eighth youth soccer championship was a direct result of the current political development. The arrests also attracted very angry comments on the floor of the British House of Commons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trans-Africa, a Washington-based lobbying group which concerns itself with African and Caribbean issues, wrote a letter to Abacha in which it regretted the &quot;unfounded treason charges&quot; against Abiola. It called on Abacha to &quot;expedite the restoration of democracy to Nigeria's 100 million people who yearn for it. To do less will result in incalculable damage to Africa's most populous nation and the eventual global economic and political isolation of your regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The letter was signed by 56 prominent African-Americans. Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, told the BBC last Thursday that his organisation was ready to do battle with the Abacha regime, saying it would not relent until military rule was terminated in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strangely, attempts to have the detention of especially Yar'Adua discussed at the constitutional conference last week was thrown out. It was not clear if the delegates were intimidated by the presence of soldiers at the conference venue. Eight conference delegates from Katsina State had issued a two-paragraph statement demanding Yar'Adua's release. But when Anselem Eyo, a delegate from Akwa Ibom State, moved that the conference should intercede on behalf of their detained colleague, some of the delegates kicked against the motion, saying they were in Abuja to draft a constitution.  Mohmud Attah, a conference delegate from Kogi State, said the delegates could not intercede because it was &quot;clearly a security matter.&quot; He argued that when other prominent Nigerians were detained in the past, nobody pleaded for them: &quot;I believe we have got other important issues to discuss. Who does not know that Yar'Adua is being suspected for? He should go and clear himself.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, chairman of the conference, later ruled that the arrest of Yar'Adua was outside the purview of the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, the Civil Liberties Organisation, CLO and the National Conscience Party, NCP, also reacted to the arrests of the retired generals, and the suspected coup plotters. NADECO described the arrests of &quot;such important personalities as a former head of state and his deputy&quot; as &quot;disgraceful and alarming.&quot; The statement which was signed by Bolaji Akinyemi, former external affairs minister and NADECO spokesman in London, chided the military for entrenching &quot;a cycle of coups, arrests and executions&quot; which &quot;will never solve the political problems of Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CLO is worried that Yar'Adua is detained under very &quot;strict and harsh conditions.&quot; He is said to be denied access to radio, television, telephone, newspapers or magazines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NCP, in its statement, said the mere fact that some of those arrested in connection with the alleged coup plot are noted opponents of the regime makes the motive for their arrests suspect. The statement, signed by Femi Aborisade, the director of organisation and strategies, called for &quot;a free and fair trial for the alleged coup plotters...in the normal open court and (they) should be allowed access to counsel of their choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jimmy Carter, former US president who was one of the international leaders to plead for the release of Obasanjo and the others in detention, is planning a peace mission to Nigeria. He is expected to meet senior government officials to further appeal for national reconciliation through he release of those arrested in connection with the coup plot. It was learnt that traditional rulers who visited Abacha last week had the same message: that Obasanjo and other politicians arrested should be freed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Ibrahim Dasuki, the Sultan of Sokoto who led the 14 traditional rulers, said thier visit to Aso Rock was to express their loyalty, shock and sympathy over the alleged coup plot, the motive was to douse dwhat government sources described as &quot;the fear of the unknown.&quot; The traditional rulers were said to have expressed the fear that if the matter was not resolved amicably, it could lead the country into more crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other world leaders are said to be putting pressures on Abacha not to put Obasanjo and some of the detained politicians and soldiers on trial. The northern elders' forum, a loose association of political elites from the northern states, is to send a delegation to Aso Rock this week. Kaita told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that they were still discussing the issue but added that they, like other Nigerians, were concerned about the coup plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abba Kyari, a retired brigadier-general also confirmed to &quot;Newswatch&quot; that the Northern elders were holding meetings concerning the detention of Yar'Adua. But he said that government was yet to tell them the real reason for Yar'Adua's detention. &quot;It is when we are told formally, not on pages of newspapers, that we will know how to approach the issue,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether such appeals will influence Abacha's decision on the issue remains to be seen. Even when he received the traditional rulers last week, he said when investigations are concluded, they &quot;would leave no one in doubt&quot; about the individual roles played by some of those arrested in connection with the coup plot. Describing the suspected coup plotters as &quot;misguided elements,&quot; the head of state said &quot;the objectives and negative intentions of the perpetrators of this act&quot; would be made public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the coup plot was uncovere, several groups have been sending delegations to the federal government to express their support. &quot;Newswatch&quot; also learnt all the solidarity messages being sent to Abacha from the states may harden his position on the fate of all those arrested by security agents as a result of the plot. &quot;What the so-called solidarity messages and visits will do is to create the false impression that the people are in support of military rule and that is dangerous because it will encourage the leaders to kill these suspects,&quot; a defence source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What has been confusing analysts of the unfolding situation in Nigeria is the secrecy surrounding the identity of those involved in the alleged coup plot. In a statement on Friday, March 10, Abdulsalam Abubakar, a major-general and chief of defence staff, had explained why names of the suspects were being kept secret. Said he: &quot;It will be premature and prejudicial to justice to mention names because of the damage that can be done to the psyche of those who may be cleared in the long run.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has led to speculations in the press about those involved in the coup plot and what their intentions were. But as the picture of the coup plot became clearer last week, &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that some of the officers listed as having been involved in the coup plot had nothing to do with it. In its story of March 20, for instance, &quot;Newswatch&quot; had mentioned Cyril Iweze, a major-general and army's director of logistics, as one of the senior officers arrested in connection with the coup plot. It was discovered that he was not involved in the plot and was never arrested. Several other retired and serving military officers linked with the alleged plot in some other publications are raising objections to such linkages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence sources also said Mike Torey, the military administrator of Enugu State was mentioned only because the conference from which some officers were alleged to have been recruited for the coup plot was held in Enugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ike Nwachukwu, a retired major-general and former minister of external affairs, issued a sttement saying he was &quot;aggrieved by the concern generated and impression created in the minds of my family and friends&quot; by a magazine story linking him with the coup plot. He had been mentioned by a weekly journal as one of those arrested. He said that after serving the military and Nigeria for 30 years, the insinuation that he was involved in the coup plot was a calculated attempt &quot;to question my honour, integrity and loyalty to Nigeria.&quot; He added: &quot;I am not, have not been and shall not engage in any plan to disrupt the process of government in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence sources also told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that although Babangida had not been linked to the coup plot,&quot; the ring leaders are people who enjoyed protection under him.&quot; Early in 1985, some of them were said to have been implicated in a plot to overthrow former head of state Mohammed Budhari. As punishment, they were only sent on overseas courses, intelligence sources claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also claimed that the coup plot was initially hatched early in 1994 and had been supported and encouraged by civilians, including some who later became ministers in Abacha's cabinet. &quot;Their appointments as ministers,&quot; said a military source, &quot;weakened the plan to overthrow the government last year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Defence sources also confirmed &quot;Newswatch&quot; story of March 20 concerning the alleged plan by the suspected coup plotters to eliminate some prominent Nigerians, including military officers and civilians. They were alleged to have argued that Nigeria's development was being hampered by those listed for elimination because they, through the domination of the military, the economy and politics had retarded Nigeria's growth. As for the military, officers from the rank of brigadier-general were to be either killed or retired, the sources claimed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Full investigations into the coup plot began last Friday. Despite assurances that the case would be speedily disposed of, the pressures being mounted on the government may delay the final judgement. Abacha himself has promised that investigations would be very thorough. But not all the detainees have faith in the outcome of such investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yar'Adua, for instance, has gone to court to challenge his arrest and detention. On March 14, his counsel, Chike Ohigbue, asked the federal high court, Lagos, to declare that Yar'Adua's arrest and detention without any formal charge were unlawful, unconstitutional, null and void. He also wanted the court to declare that his arrest and detention violated his immunity from arrests as a result of his roles at the constitutional conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babatunde Belgore, the chief judge of the federal high court, however, threw out the case saying Yar'Adua could not claim in one breath that he was not told the reason for his arrest and detention and claim against that it was because of his utterances on the floor of the constitutional conference.  By last Thursday, Alfred Kasumu, a professor of law and senior advocate of Nigeria, SAN, had taken over the case. He filed a fresh suit in which he amended the statements in the first suit to read: &quot;Although Yar'Adua was not informed of any reason to warrant his detention, he has cause to believe that it may not be unconnected width speeches he made on the floor of the constitutional conference with respect to the governance of this country including the complete and total disengagement of the military from politics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yar'Adua's lawyers, however, vowed last week to &quot;fight for Yar'Adua's release, using all constitutional means available in Nigeria.&quot; It may be a tough fight.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 6, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Niyi Osundare</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eko Akete, Ile Ogbon: Lagos, House of Wisdom. Arodede maa ja o: The one that hangs precariously without dropping. A romi sa legbe: Running infinity of water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The above snippet from an old popular song provides a poignant ontological geography of Lagos, the commercial and social nerve centre of Nigeria, and, until recently, the country's administrative capital. Lagos is an uncanny combination of myth and reality, of esoteric indigeneity and imported alienation; a city where zinc-walled, paper-windowed shacks tremble in the concrete shadows of ultra-modern skyscrapers; where tears and laughter erupt and wrestle before seeking a fitful truce in the belly of the sea.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the sea is Lagos. Lagos is the sea. The Atlantic it was which eased in the first flotilla of boats; in its Adamic proclamation the name 'Lagos' was born. But like everything African, the city has learnt to bear the burden of a double nomenclature, handling it, where possible, with peculiar ambidexterity; 'Lagos' being offspring of its foreign baptism, while 'Eko' remains its rooted, authentic identity. 'Lagos' dominates map of politics and high commerce; 'Eko' rules the lore of a deep uncharitable nativity; 'Lagos' measures the waters by the circumference of the coastline, 'Eko' issues forth from the vortex of a fluid abyss. Thus, while Lagos may oftentimes appear anonymous even by virtue of that naming, another metro-pole of screeching automobiles and restless elevators, a riot of roofs in endless battle with the skyline, Eko is the product of a pointed, almost religious specificity of visceral methods and cerebral sympathies, that narrow lane of consciousness where science collides with sensibility and memory is born midwifed by nostalgia. In many ways, these two names are equidistant from the Nigerian experience. In other ways they arrive at a certain confluence, some indescribable co-terminality. An argument may, indeed, be raised as to whether these two names refer to one and the same place. For one person's 'Lagos' is another's 'Eko'. It is often possible to hate 'Lagos' while helplessly bound by 'Eko's' charm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its two names, which are also its two destinies, the city casts a gigantic shadow over the Nigerian hinterland. See Lagos and die, screams a legend on one of those brave lorries which ply the long, hazardous road between Lagos and the interior, trucking in the upland farm's yams and plantains for the insatiable comfort of the city stomach, and returning later with glittering brands of imported merchandise. That legend itself is child to a legendary chronicle. In the past, in those imperial days of the ocean liner and the BOAC (British Overseas Airways Corporation), it used to be See London and die. Proud... and thoroughly enviable... been-to's (humorous label for returnees from overseas) regaled open-mouthed stay-at-homes with tales of London's grandeur: the underground train which burrows through the earth like fabulous rodents; the motley drama of Trafalgar Square where care-free pigeons defecate on human heads with imperial disdain (to be sure, Lagos fountain ran dry with post-independence euphoria, the pigeons vanished without trace!); the sheer architectural awe of Westminster; the royal splendour of Buckingham Palace wherein lived the Crown that ruled the empire; Elephant and Castle which had a castle but no elephant...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then the number of travellers multiplied, and increasing familiarity put a dent London's magic. Then the locus of wonder changed: See Paris and die. City of scrubbed streets and wine-draped boulevards. City of modes and manners where the French language tumbles out of sophisticated mouths with the liquid impeccability of champagne cascading into a civil tumbler. City which spies the world from the lofty pinnacle of Eiffel Tower...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somewhat aware of the imperial grandeur of London and the methodical sophistication of Paris, Lagos thought herself capable of similar wonders.  However, 'See Lagos and die' is both affirmatively celebratory and chillingly apocalyptic. It is at the same time an invitation to the marvellous possibilities of a complex city and premonition about its dark and deadly shadows. Many do see Lagos... and die!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is always something about this gateway city to arouse the visitor's wonder: its breathless bridges and flyovers (old people still talk about the spectacular miracle of Carter Bridge, the first steel and mortar link between Lagos Island and its mainland); the thronged, dappled commerce on the Marina where virtually every trans-national company in the world possesses a jealously and Oyingbo whose awesome fame is enshrined in folksongs and proverbs, Eyo festival masquerade and the Nordic beard of Santa Claus... Complementing all this is the unique cosmopolitan prowess of Lagos, its ethnic, racial, and cultural heterogeneity, the pidginised, sometimes creolised discourse of its daily commerce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos may be no one's city because it is everyone's city, but it is far from being a melting pot. Ethnic and class tensions simmer under the blanket of cosmopolitan uniformity. There are golf clubs and social clubs where the privileged open sesame is still the colour of one's skin or one's money. In Lagos's vertical mosaic, the studied serenity of Ikoyi shares borders with the futuristic architecture of Victoria Island, both of which are several centuries and many bank accounts from Ajegunle, Mushin, and other slums where life is cheap and tortuous, where there is no practical alternative to violent criminality. Despite these jostling boulders, Lagos flows on like the infinity of its waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those waters are, indeed, the core of its magic..., and might. We all know (only the uninitiated may pretend to a modicum of ignorance) that mermaids trade their fishy tails for legs upon merely stepping on beach sands, then saunter into the streets, charming, miraculously seductive. Young men stare in petrifying admiration, while their mothers apply the rein, ever so aware of the dangers of having fishes as daughter-in-laws. There are also sea spirits which spiral up from the depths at night, secure themselves in the saddle of waves, galloping beachwards, their bodies bathed in the silvery intensity of the half-moon. If you see them in the streets, clothed in white calico and crocodile skin slippers, their gait leisurely, their consonants more liquid than their vowels, do not wait to be told that the demons of the blessings! Sometimes Olokun, the sea goddess, herself plays games with fishermen, teases their nets with eels and water scorpions, then pats the bottom of their little boats. At the first light she romps to the beach, her hair sequinned in shells and shingles, her eyes like new-laid eggs, her breasts two magnificent mountains, her voice a shade between serene whisper and fishy echo. Lagosians know this by uncanny instinct: whoever catches Olokun's glimpse at this divine hour will live the rest of his or her life in boundless fortune. Which is why at dawn the beach never lacks throng of callers. Lagos is, indeed, the sea. The sea is Lagos. When Lagos recently lost its status as Nigeria's administrative capital, Lagosians were quick to ask: &quot;If they take the capital from Lagos, can they take the sea?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without a regular nurture by fiction, fact soon pales out and dies.  Lagos knows this though it is never so sure where fact ends and fiction takes over. In like manner, in the eyes and minds of rural dwellers Lagos's fact is as prodigious as its fiction. For them Lagos is both a dreamland and a radix malorum. Rural tales, songs, and proverbs are replete with the ambiguous possibilities of this city. It is a city whose streets are literally paved with gold (a myth whose embers were fanned into a blaze in the prodigal years of the oil boom): a city where everything happens, where anything can be found (if it is not available in Lagos, then you can't find it anywhere else in Nigeria).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This miracle city is also the home of fads and fashions, the barometer of social taste, sounding board for imported etiquettes. The weirdest, most extravagant manners exact a certain measure of toleration, even acceptability once people know that 'that is how they do it in Lagos'. Tailors, seamstresses, hair-dressers, brick-layers, carpenters, barbers, musicians, and suchlike sure that their bill-boards include the magic words: Trained in Lagos, or simply, Lagos-trained (two, three decades ago, the attention winner was Trained in London).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is something constantly perplexing about Lagos to the sober consciousness of those far from its madding crowd. It is that city where people perpetually move in the fast lane, a place where fortunes are as rapidly made as marred, where a millionaire in the morning maybe swiftly done out of his wealth at noon, crawling, finally, into an ignoble grave with the setting sun. In the frugal thinking of rural folks, Lagos is the hell-hole of profligacy, where money earned by the left hand soon evaporates from the right. Hence Lagos is a-jo-mo-so-wo-ma-jo-mo-mo-wo-wa-le (a place which lets you make all your profits without allowing you to take any of them home).  Hence the late highlife musician, Adeolu Akinsanya, exclaims in one of his songs: Inawo Eko le ju! (Lagos expenses are killing!). And it is a truism widely acknowledged that Owo Eko Eko lo ngbe (Money made in Lagos never leaves Lagos).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Lagos is a fortune-wrecking, money-grobbling monster with a thousand mouths, the most ruthless, most insatiable of those mouths is Sisi Eko (Lagos Lady), that alluring, bewitched loafer whose job is the progressive dispossession of men. Heavily lipsticked, long-fingernailed, scantily clad, wig-headed, and stiletto-heeled, she is a practiced schemer with eyes buried deep in men's pockets. A highlife song in the early seventies drew inspiration from this pervasively negative representation of the Lagos woman: Sisi Eko: Lagos Lady Sisi Eko: Lagos Lady Oko fun e lowo o: Husband gave you money O fi je'ja dindin: You squandered it on fried fish (a delicacy) lwa yi o dara: This is abominable lwa yi o sunwon o: This is improper Ma se the ra re:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this supremely patriarchal perspective, the woman is reduced to a part of Lagos problems. Sisi Eko is the ultimate in prodigal venality, a callous, calculating Jezebel with unmistakable affinities with the acquisitive amorality of Cyprian Ekwensi's Jagua Nana or the cash-and-carry cupidity of Ken Saro Wiwa's Madam de Madam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos is ready-made theatre complete with a largely motley cast, a highly flexible stage, a script constantly re-writing itself, with the Atlantic Ocean as cyclorama. The actors and actresses often constitute their own audience, laughing at their own jokes, crying over their own sorrows. To people not really familiar with its logic, the city might look like some nightmare in which people and things are constantly, listlessly rushing-to-mowhere. Although &quot;ultra modern&quot; supermarkets have sprung up in every street, we all know that in Lagoon City, everywhere is a market. At least the itinerant traders know this, jumping, shouting from car to car, thrusting their assorted wares at motorists glumly immobilised by the city's legendary &quot;go slow&quot; (traffic hold-up).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In one of her superbly engaging stories, Karen King-Aribisala has described this curious commerce as &quot;a moving supermarket of concentrated chaos&quot;, but who doesn't know that to remove this chaos is to eliminate one of the most gripping scenes in Lagos's drama? In a land which recently discovered the mad logic of &quot;marketforces&quot;, how else can the &quot;parallel economy&quot; sustain itself except through the trickle-down traffic of legislated anarchy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether as a place or metaphor, dream or nightmare, Lagos has remained the source and catalyst of literacy imagination. Hardly is there any contemporary Nigerian literary work of note in which Lagos is not mentioned - or kept within a discernible connotative circumference. Odia Ofeimun laments the seamless agony of &quot;Lagosed&quot; souls; Gabriel Okara captures the frenzied supplication of the Aladura one significant night on Victoria Beach; while jagua Nana is Ekwensi's sexual-political exploration of Nigeria through Lagos. In The Interpreters, Wole Soyinka's iconoclastic young men negotiate their ways through the flare and flood of a baffling city; in end Lagos becomes a parable, a text which persistently interpretes its own interpreters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where Lagos is not the major setting, it often plays the role of a king maker whose power is in rivalry with that of the king. For example, in both Ake and Isara, Lagos looms inevitably large from the background: spawning ideas, dictating the pace of events, marshalling people, re-arranging places, making sure it is a lexical presence in the syntax of the political idiom. It is no narrative or historical surprise that both Daodu and the horse which bears him to the throne of Isara are &quot;shipped&quot; in from Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are works in which Lagos's centrality is more ambivalent.  For instance, although Lagos provides the actual setting for No longer at Ease, the psychological and cultural centre of the narrative swings between there and Umuofia, the famous village where the protagonist's grandfather lived out the tragic drama of Things Fall Apart. Indeed, to members of the place to whose hazards and insecurities the union provides a strong communal antidote. There is that dream of the return home after a long sojourn in the city. Thus Lagos gives, but also takes. Its brittle, anonymous canvas is dotted with passionate rural mores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now let us pursue this exploration beyond the Nigerian borders.  Generally, the city has always held a profound fascination for writers: Freetown for Syl Cheney-Coker Dakar for Ousmane Sembene; Soweto for Mbulelo Nzamane; Paris for Baudelaire; Berlin for Brecht; Madras for Narayan; Dublin for Joyce; Chicago for Richard Wright; Munich and Venice for Thomas Mann...  In some cases the same city may spawn different, even contrasting images and modes of representation: compare, for instance, the satiric, excoriative exploration of London in Dicken's Bleak House with the sedate, stream-of-consciousness navigation of the same city in Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. Or let us go back to the early Romantic period and join William Blake's journey through London's &quot;charter'd street&quot;, with all their &quot;marks of weakness, marks of woe&quot;. In all these instances, far from being a mere backdrop, the city is an active strand in the narrative fabric, an indispensable trope in a gigantic text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos is suchlike text, only more baffling, more amorphous. Where else in the world would you find the beggar's song wafting so naturally into a soiree of juju, highlife, chachacha, reggae, calypso, etc. blaring forth from 1000-watt loudspeakers even in a business district street? Where else would you encounter the inventive ribaldry of the agbero (motor park tout), the chilling rat-a-tat of the robber's gun, the shoeless army of the jobless waving thumb-stained diplomas like expired tailsmans? And to make it divinely clear, this is a city where God goes by many names, though a deep nativist impulse sometimes tames the jealousy of imported gods. And yet the boundless energy of this city, its rugged vitality, its polyglot culture, its acres and acres of possibility. This city where everything happens sometimes without happening, where crowded roads terminate in Atlantic cul-de-sac, where the sojourner finds his fate by losing it. This city so sweet, so severely sour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 8, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chairman, Members of the Corporate Council on Africa, Distinguished Business Executives and Friends of Ghana, Ladies and Gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is indeed a pleasure to be here today. We bring you warm and fraternal greetings from the Government and people of Ghana. (We hope the warmth will begin to dispel the cold front!) I must thank the staff of the corporate C council on Africa and the many corporate sponsors of this event for this invitation. I would also like to express my gratitude to officials of the U.S. government for the warm reception accorded us and the excellent arrangements made for our stay here in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The very presence here of so many corporate executives demonstrate the confidence you have in the continent of Africa and specifically in our country, Ghana. This confidence is very well-placed because our continent has no other direction to go but forward.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa, we all know, is a continent with the richest array of resources in the world; yet it remains the most underdeveloped and currently accounts for only two percent of world trade. We need to ask ourselves, why this is so. No continent has been as battered as the African continent - in the colonial era, in the struggle for independence, during the period of Cold War, and now post-Cold-War. Africa has often been assailed by external forces who have been attracted by its resources but only for their own one-sided interests. Africa was victimized during the colonial period by her raw materials and her human resources being exploited to build up value for other continents. More recently, during the period of Cold War, Africa has been victimized by super power rivalry which posed false choices for our leaders between competing political and economic poles without any specific reference to our circumstances on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the condemnation of Africa, or the dismissiveness with which Africa is treated in certain quarters is unfair and unjust. The native American saying that you need to walk in my shoes to understand my existence is very appropriate for understanding Africa's situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We do accept responsibility for our own failures, and we in Ghana have decided firmly that we will not be a failure; we will uphold the image of Africa, we will show the world what is positive ad successful, what is noble and elevating from our continent. This giant of a continent is stirring itself up and I am confident that you put your faith, your commitments, you investments in Africa will not be disappointed!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, astute business people, for very good reasons, have been looking to the continent as a dynamic region to make sound new investments. There has come a realization that the continent not only has natural resources but also has a huge population whose tastes and demands can stimulate new phases of industrial development and economic boom in the world. Mining, for example, has always been big business in Africa, but now investors are looking to shift to more value-added production on the continent taking advantage of the lower labor costs. Agribusiness, utilities, the energy sector, manufacturing, financial and tourism services offer other opportunities. In the telecommunications field, the giants of the industry, from the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France are all making investments in a continent that is ripe for major new initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I acknowledge the fact that political stability and security of investment is of paramount importance to investors. And in this respect, the history of conflicts in certain regions and countries of Africa gives some investors pause. But as we get to the roots of these conflicts, we can clearly see that the economic development of the continent will contribute immensely to resolving many of these situations of conflict. Today, we in Ghana are proud that amidst the ocean of well-reported conflicts, there are islands of peace and political stability that offer themselves as havens for foreign investment. &quot;One of such countries in Africa is Ghana.&quot; Those of you who have not visited Ghana recently, - or those who have not visited at all, do not know what you are missing!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our many favourable attributes include: a stable political and social environment in which the safety of your persons, property and investment is assured; a determined and consistent government following a prudent and disciplined economic reconstruction program; a liberalized trade policy and exchange rate regime that has enabled a complete transformation of access to foreign exchange in the economy. With the number of for ex bureaus doing brisk business in the city of Accra, for instance, I understand it is easier to deal in foreign currency, especially travelers cheques, in Accra than it is here in Washington!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also have a very well-endowed natural resource base that includes gold, diamonds, manganese, bauxite and other minerals, large tracts of arable land and climate that together create a good basis for agriculture and still under exploited sea resources; an environment of relatively cordial relations between labour and management; we seek to establish regular and close consultation between government, employers and labour unions under a tripartite negotiation mechanism. The workforce itself is relatively better educated than many places in the world, and quite skilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I should point our further that Ghana offers ready access to other regional and international markets, such as the 16-member 200 million people Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as well as access to the over half a billion people in the European Community Caribbean and Pacific, Lome Convention trading area, based on our most favoured nation status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most significant of all, Ghana boasts a warm, friendly, intelligent and honest people who are a delight to do business with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have made considerable efforts over the last decade to become, in the eyes of objective observers a role model for good performance and successful economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of you here must have heard of the economic turn around that has occurred in Ghana since 1982. This was achieved through the design and implementation of an Economic Recovery Programme that enabled us to achieve steady growth of about 5 per cent per annum from the early 1980's, a period some refer to as Africa's &quot;lost decade&quot;. Our key objective has been to stimulate productivity and encourage both foreign and local private investment, and ensure a prudent and effective harnessing of public resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the important priorities have been the restoration and maintenance of fiscal and monetary discipline, and the control of inflation.  We succeeded in bringing inflation from nearly 130% per annum in the early 1980s to less than 30% per annum today. Meanwhile, domestic savings and investments have increased by 12% and 14% per annum respectively in recent years. We are by no means satisfied with these figures. Inflation has to go down much further so as to make life more comfortable for the man and woman in the street, and we are currently focusing on how to ensure this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other priorities of our economic recovery program include the rationalization of the public sector by way of divestiture of over 300 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the trimming down of the over-bloated civil service by about 60%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has concentrated public investment expenditure on infrastructure rehabilitation, which has brought many urban and feeder roads up to acceptable modern standards. Similarly, transport and communications infrastructure - our telephone systems which are so important for business people, our ports and harbours, - have all undergone a transformation in recent years. The National Electrification Scheme to extend electricity to all parts of the country is very much on course. The extent of commitment of communities throughout the country to contribute to bringing this important benefit to themselves has been remarkable. To meet the rapidly growing demand for electricity that our economic recovery programme has stimulated we are now encouraging independent power producers to get involved in energy production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of the above reform measures have had the effect of making both the rural and urban areas of Ghana good sites for a wide variety of investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana's economic progress has been reinforced by the successful political transition to multiparty democracy and constitutional rule. We established a new constitutional order from January 1993 after Presidential and Parliamentary elections. There has been quite an exuberant testing of the new Constitutional order. Some have even tried to provoke situations of anarchy under the guise of freedom, but as a Government we have not been unduly prickly about even some excesses, though we will not countenance a reversal of the gains we have made. The Judiciary has been eager to assert its independence and operates unrestrained. All this is an eloquent pointer to the tolerance, degree of understanding, and the willingness and determination of the government and people to succeed in fulfilling our national aspiration of prosperity in freedom and with justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our efforts at establishing democratic institutions included a conscious policy of decentralizing political power and public administration.  This has led to the establishment of 110 District Assemblies through which the local communities now have the authority to initiate and implement development programs that meet their own defined material and cultural needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen, I recently signed into law a new Ghana Investment Promotion Centre Act 1994 that was passed by Parliament. This Law, unlike the old Code, mandates the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre to promote, rather than regulate, investment. Copies of the Law, setting out the incentives and concessions to both domestic and foreign investors, can be obtained through our Embassy here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new Law obviates the need for new enterprises to go through long bureaucratic approval processes. An investor only need register or incorporate the enterprise in accordance with the Ghana Companies Code 1963 (Act 179). Incentives and concessions are triggered automatically and do not require separate application and approval. Incentives under the new Law include: full exemption from Customs import duties on plant machinery and equipment required for the setting up of the enterprise; accelerated depreciation; guaranteed transferability of profits, dividends, royalties, director's fees and capital in the event of liquidation of an enterprise; guarantees against expropriation of the enterprise; guarantees against being forced to cede any part of an investor's interest in the enterprise and a framework for settlement of investment disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana, as most of you know, is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) of the World Bank Group. As such, investors can benefit from the insurance and guarantee services provided for projects in member countries of the World Bank. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) of the United States is also very willing to provide investment guarantees for American investors going to Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends of Ghana,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am happy to see so many faces in this audience who represent U.S.  companies that are already contributing to Ghana's economy. We applaud you.  But I will be even happier if by the end of my visit, we have an even greater number of companies heading for Ghana and more investments flowing in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should not surprise to hear that The Ghana Stock Exchange has recently been marked amongst the best of emerging stock markets in terms of performance and capital appreciation. When the New York Times in April 1994 recommended five major African Stock Exchanges on which American investors might invest, the newspaper placed the Ghana Stock Exchange at the top of the list. With more than 70 percent in annual average stock appreciation in 1993 and also in 1994, the stock market in Ghana, though young, is already providing an attractive framework for foreign investors to participate in Ghana's economic transformation. With a current market capitalisation of US $1.8 billion, it also the 3rd largest sub-Saharan Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was on this Stock Exchange as well as on the London Stock Exchange that last year some of Government's shares in a major national asset, the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, were floated. The success of that floatation is still being talked about and I am happy to have in my delegation here the Chief Executive of Ashanti Goldfields, Mr. Sam Jonah. It was also on the Ghana Stock Exchange that the Government sold its shares in some multinational companies to foreign partners like Unilever. I am also happy to have in my delegation the Chairman of Unilever Ghana, Mr. Ishmael Yamson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The involvement of such stalwarts of the private sector in my team here is a manifestation of the close relations we are forging between Government and the private sector in Ghana. Our Chambers of Commerce and Mines, the Association of Ghana Industries, the Ghana Employers Association, Private Enterprise Foundation are all key players in our march towards a better future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ladies and Gentlemen,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I deemed it important to find time to address you during my rather short stay here in deference to the statement attributed to President Calvin Coolidge that : &quot;The business in an increasingly competitive global market place requires you to be open to new opportunities, to seek, in the best American tradition, new frontiers to conquer. Africa, we are told, is the last unconquered frontier for business, and we hope many of you here will participate in this challenge of African economic development, specifically in Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana has a bright future. That future depends not only on sound and stable government policy in a peaceful environment but also on a larger role for the creativity of the private sector. That future must involve the foreign business community, particularly the American business community, particularly the American business community. I may add that there are important links between the activities of U.S. governmental agencies and private business. The aid programmes of USAID for instance create opportunities for U.S. trade and investment to follow up on. We have been very satisfied with the assistance USAID is providing us, among other things to help our export drive. We are also hopeful that U.S. governmental initiatives such as the Shipbuilding Initiative under the Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation, the opening up of new markets by the Commerce Department and the availability of export credit lines of US Eximbank will all contribute to strengthening economic relations between the U.S. and Ghana. We, the Government of Ghana, are keeping our side of the bargain. We call on you, the American business community, to rise up to your part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Cherno Baba Jallow</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an exclusive interview with Ron Mcgullagh and Elizabeth Ground, who were recently in The Gambia to do a BBC sponsored documentary on The Gambia's current political situation, Sir Dawda singled out the U.S. Administration for its posture towards the &quot;lack of strong defense and human rights in The Gambia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sir Dawda contended that the United States, which really believes in democracy and human rights, and now the sole super power leading the new international order &quot;should study the Gambian situation and do something about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On allegations that The Gambia under his leadership saw unbridled corruption in government circles, Sir Dawda vehemently denied that corruption was ever rampant during his tenure of office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I mean, for me to say that no one was corrupt or that no corruption had been perpetrated in The Gambia would be wrong or foolish,&quot; Sir Dawda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, he argued that no country remains free of corruption, but maintained that The Gambia is one of those countries that knows little or no corruption at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Gambia, &quot; Sir Dawda said, &quot;has very few resources; but because of good management, financial and fiscal discipline in my government, we were able to make a success where most other countries have failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that corruption has often been one of the often repeated justification for the military in Africa to seize power from civilian governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But invariably, they immediately embark upon corrupt practices, and this has happened in The Gambia within this short space of military rule,&quot; Sir Dawda alleged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the British travel advice against British tourists visiting The Gambia for its 'political instability', Sir Dawda believed that is 'quite reasonable'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Few months after the July 22nd coup,&quot; he said, &quot;there had been a counter coup resulting in the loss of lives of 50 to 60 people.&quot; He added that in a situation like this, &quot;it would be foolhardy to think that the situation in The Gambia is stable. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the economy and general welfare of Gambians under the military regime, Sir Dawda lamented that The Gambia's economy is &quot;on the verge of disaster&quot; because business activity, vis-a vis importation and re-exportation of goods that had been the country's good source of revenue, were being strangled under choking circumstances. He also said the tourist industry had been dealt a devastating blow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Because of mismanagement of this present military regime,&quot; Sir Dawda alleged, &quot;the economy has started to suffer, and the living conditions of Gambians are becoming much more deplorable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He argued, with some pride, that The Gambia under his leadership, had performed plausibly well in the economic sector. &quot;We had undergone one of the most successful structural adjustment programmes with the IMF and World Bank,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that his government had achieved an average of four per cent growth per annum; and &quot;we were going to double this in the Gateway Project beginning in 1994.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On any clandestine motives to engineer a counter coup against the AFPRC Government, Sir Dawda replied that he wouldn't, but would &quot;encourage Gambians to stand up and say they do not accept the overthrow of a democratic government by unaccountable military people who have no experience...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He called on the Gambian people as well as the international community to denounce the military Government. &quot;Having taken power, they would now perpetuate themselves in power and manipulate the people and the country,&quot; Sir Dawda bitterly complained.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Fatou Jahumpa Ceesay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, the deposed Gambian president, Sir Dawda Jawara, visited the United States, where he held series of meetings with U.S. government officials and the Gambian community, in a bid to drum up their support for his restoration to the presidency. Among the groups Sir Dawda approached for support was the Pro-Democracy Movement which is a Gambian-initiated democracy movement based in Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our reporter, Fatou Jahumpa Ceesay, who was on a working visit to the U.S. at the time, had an exclusive interview with Dr. Sulayman Nyang, the convener of the movement and a top professor at Howard University. Below are the excerpts of the interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: To begin with, what is your opinion about the current political situation in The Gambia?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: Well, when you observed the situation in The Gambia you have to g back to the prelude of what had happened. The situation deteriorated so badly that the only corrective was possibly only through military intervention. Personally, I don't like military intervention. I would prefer to have a civilian democratic society. Actually, the situation as it exists now involves the need to a democratic order as soon as possible. Of course there is the need to set up a commission of inquiry to look into the deeds of the past. A democratic order cannot be restored with all the defects of the past. As a matter of fact I am proudly concerned about the current political trend in The Gambia which compelled me to convene at Howard University a meeting for a group of Gambian intellectuals and professionals to study the situation in the country. They are, for one, emotionally attached to The Gambia and they have the intellectual gadgets to help them analyse critically the goings-on in The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I expect them to be able to heat the Gambian issue with candour and without any feeling of bias. We did not agree with all the points raised but I would say all the points raised but I would say we had a fruitful discussion since we raised critical questions. The National Consultative Committee have, nonetheless, come up with a finding which is relieving for anybody with serious concern for The Gambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: Have you current knowledge about economic situation in The Gambia especially after the dawn of sanctions by Britain, the EU and the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: Well, the British and American authorities who decided to sever economic relations with The Gambia were merely enacting a policy guideline.  For example, the United States Department was instructed not to deal with governments of militaristic nature. The figures I have on the Gambian economy are from sources here in the city and they reflect the performance for 1995 which is expected to be minus four which would be very bad. Now we hope things would reverse half way through the next year. Another thing is the reserve and the figures I receive to this effect are not bad but it would be problematic if the trying trend continues. Once The Gambia can attract the British, Americans and the EU back with economic assistance through genuine projects of development, we may see a trend suggesting otherwise. It would be bad if they refuse to come forward and the current Government may be forced to dip into the reserves and this would certainly be unfavourable for the country. Based on information available to me, the military Government have been able to finance five to six months of import but if this continues uncomplicated by donors, there could be national bankruptcy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that the donors will be sufficiently impressed by the performance of the transition Government now headed by Captain Jammeh. I think the Government has the responsibility in allaying the fears of the average Gambian about the issue of restoring democracy. They must also make it clear to donors that they are concerned about relationship between economic performance and political stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: How would you asses former party leaders (opposition) operating in their capacities as private individuals on holidays?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: Nothing should prevent them from using their pen to write in the media expressing their views. Some of the weaknesses of the former regime are familiar with them so they have every reason to make themselves heard. I even think people were linked with the PPP and are sincere enough should contribute to this political change since they are in a better position to decry the weaknesses of the former regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: I learnt that the deposed President Sir Dawda Jawara was here in the U.S. and visited Atlanta, Georgia and Washington DC, can you tell me if you indeed met him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: No I didn't, I was contacted by him (Jawara) before he came here through the telephone three times from London, apparently he had the news that a group of Gambians had met and decided to address some of the problems facing the country. I told him during our dialogue that the old regime under him did not do any serious intellectual defense of democracy.  That was an important point Jawara will even remember. He was entertaining hopes that when he comes here he will get the chance of meeting us but unfortunately it didn't happen and there were a number of reasons why that didn't happen. Nonetheless, he met with the Gambian community in Atlanta but he didn't meet with the Gambian community in Washington DC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: Do you know if he was able to see officials at the State Department or any American authority?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: Yes,... I mean that is what the Washington Times article I referred to earlier brought to our attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: Whom did he meet at the State Department?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: We were informed by the paper (Washington Times) that he met the assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, George Moose, and of course based on the article, Mr. Moose felt that Jawara deserved support. I think that article must have been reproduced in one of the Gambian newspapers, (N.B. The American embassy in Banjul said the article under reference misquoted George Moose).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: Do you think Jawara should be campaigning to restore himself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: Well one of the reasons why I wanted to have a direct meeting with Sir Dawda was to raise this issue with him. It is really correct to say what Jawara has been in the helm of state affairs for 30 years; in fact he was there for 33 in view of his pre-independence position as prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I give him credit for the good he has done the state, but in light of present revelations by the commissions of inquiry his overall record in office is quite unimpressive and undeserving to the state. The only sensible approach he can make if he wants to be recalled somewhat favourably by historians and posterity is to push for restoration of democratic rule without him. This may build upon his past image as a democrat. Though I don't know the extent, but I know that people are bitter about his misdeeds from what I could gather in telephone conversations with people in The Gambia.  Certainly people are not happy with the administration of the former regime which he headed for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: How would you describe the result of this trip to America?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: I am not in a position to make any kind of evaluation on his trip, but based on the Washington Times Jawara left U.S. with the hope that somehow the U.S. government is going to pressurise the military government in Banjul through sanctions to step down unconditionally. Of course, in an article, Jawara tried to strike a compassion between his case and Aristides'.  Now whether he will go to The Gambia I am not in a position to tell. His return to The Gambia is sure to exact a high prize in human lives. This would be reminiscent of Senegal's Intervention in 1998 in order to quash Kukoi Samba Sanyang and his supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: I understand that there is an AFPRC delegation in the US. They have in fact attended social functions organised by the Gambian community here in Washington. Can you comment on whether they are here to meet your committee?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: The group (committee) is supposed to meet them later this evening but I am not in a position now to ascertain their concerns and aims since we have to listen to them first to know what they need. We may want to know, however, how far they can work with our movement and how they would react to certain suggestions a pro-democracy movement is willing to put forward to them. There are some points, though, which I think are very critical in terms of dialogue. These rather young military officers should set precedence not for Africa but for The Gambia by recognising the need to return to barracks and prevent the Gambian nation from retrogressing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: Captain Yahya Jammeh, most people believe, is very popular following the failure of an attempted counter coup by Sana Sabally and Sadibou Hydara. He has been urging Gambians like you abroad to go back home and take part in the process of national rectification and development. Do you think you would ever answer to his call?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: Yeah, well, I have realised that a lot of Gambians have been putting pressure on me to return and offer services to the people but I think there is a lot of Gambians who are really competent and available at home to contribute effectively to the national effort. Some of them are doing fairly well there so there is no pressing reason to go back now. In fact we can help them from here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FJC: Recently I came across an obituary you wrote for the late Garba Jahumpa in the West Africa magazine. Can you expatiate on that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NYANG: I decided to write the obituary for a number of reasons one of which was that I.M. Garba Jahumpa was one of the few consistent personalities of our time who have contributed healthily to socio-economic and political development in The Gambia. In fact he deserves a book of tribute to recognise his contribution to The Gambia's development for over 50 years. He was a considerate and forthright man that we sadly miss. I hope his children will continue his impressive traits... so that what we need, continuity, that is the problem in Gambian families. Yeah, Jawara was the president, but he didn't contribute as much effectively to civic society as Jahumpa. That's a fact.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 14, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Confederation of African Football (CAF), the continent's football governing body, has issued a statement to all national football associations affiliated to it on the issue of &quot;Interference of governments in the life of the national associations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the release by CAF, the world football governing body FIFA had both at its 1992 congress in Zurich and 1994 in Chicago, took a decision prohibiting governments from mixing with the activities of national football associations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a logical consequence of this provision, FIFA will only recognise the national associations which are democratically elected. According to Article 7 of the FIFA statutes, the executive body of an association shall be appointed only by means of election within that association. The statutes of an association shall provide for an election procedure that guarantees the complete independence of the electorate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also states that FIFA will not recognise all the executive body of an association, even on an interim basis, if it has not been appointed in accordance with the stipulated rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, any decision taken by an outside body to suspend an association's executive body shall not be binding on the Federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The FIFA statues also said that leagues or any other groups of clubs at association level shall be permitted with the association's express consent and shall define the powers appointed to any group as well as its right and obligations. The regulations of any such group shall be subject to the approval of the association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement from CAF concluded by calling on national associations wishing to clarify their relationship with the public power and to preserve their autonomy, to amend their statutes to cope with the new situation as these statutes will be the only document which governs football in the national association.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 31, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As many as 50,000 Rwandan refugees are fleeing towards the Tanzanian border form camps where they were housed in Burundi. Relief officials estimate that potentially 100,000 people may head towards Tanzania in the next few days. Fear among refugees has resulted from an attack on one of several Rwanda camps in northern Burundi in which 12 Rwandan refugees were killed and 22 wounded. These migrations have occurred following violence in several quarters in Bujumbura over the pasty days by armed militias which led to the deaths of at least 150 people, left some homes burned and provoked the departure of several thousand people from their homes, some dispersing in Burundi and some seeking refuge in Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currently, there are approximately 500 refugees waiting to be allowed to cross into Tanzania near the Kobero Bridge. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is monitoring the border situation and distributing water to the refugees who have carried some food supplies with them. A few hundred are said to have decided now to remain in Burundi. The High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, has called on governments to honor their international commitments to allow refugees to seek asylum.  Because the journey takes two to three days, the vast majority of refugees have not yet reached the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The departure of the dependents of U. S. and European nationals has added to the level of fear. Staff of international relief agencies in Burundi are sending a clear message that they are not planning to depart. The UNHCR is reportedly increasing its presence in Burundi to reassure the population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees International urges the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNHCR and international donors must &quot;insist&quot; that the governments of Tanzania and Zaire continue to uphold the internationally accepted right to asylum</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In turn, the donor community should be actively engaged in identifying ways to meet the needs of this emergency, assisting the already heavily burdened asylum countries to cope with these additional demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contingency planning must include the provision of adequate water and food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donors must insure that the World Food Program receives pledges for future months to insure that minimum requirements are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ration levels should be equalized to prevent food inequalities form contributing to the insecurity in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN Security Council should remain ready to promptly respond to requests from the Government of Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees International commends the prompt and generous support of the United States to the potentially tragic and destabilizing shortage of food available for refugees and displaced persons in Central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An emergency fundraising campaign by the World Food Program (WFP) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), vigorously supported by Refugees International, resulted in approximately $100 million in new contributions to fight hunger among refugees and internally displaced persons from Rwanda and Burundi, including those in camps in Zaire and Tanzania.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugees International appreciates the rapid response of donor countries to the fundraising campaign. According to the UN agencies, ten countries have contributed an additional 100.5 million dollars for the emergency program. The U.S. contributed $47 million. European contributions account for the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The prompt and generous response of the United States was the essential catalyst of the response of other donors,&quot; said Refugees International President Lionel Rosenblatt..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; he added, &quot;the job is only half-done. This additional $100 million will only last until October or November 1995. Without more food in the pipeline by then, millions of refugees and displaced persons from Rwanda and Burundi will face cuts in food aid that will be fatal to both their long-term survival and to the fragile efforts to stabilize the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Next steps include a continued appeal to potential donors, including countries which have not yet contributed to the emergency fund. The United States can now speak forcefully and authoritatively to such potential contributors because we have acted so forcefully ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP, for its part, is reducing operational costs for the delivery and distribution of the food. These include making improvements in infrastructure and transportation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear General Abacha:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the months since the Nigerian military's annulment of the democratic presidential election of June f1993, the Nigerian government has become an absolute military dictatorship. Unfounded treason charges have been brought against the presumed winner of the election. Critics of the military regime have been killed. Hundreds more have been arbitrarily detained. the national and state legislatures have been disbanded. Labor unions have been dissolved. Elected civilian governors have been removed from office. All political activity have been banned. The country's once free press has been shut down. And owing to gross mismanagement and corruption, Nigeria's economy now borders on collapse. lamentably, Nigerian courts have lost any authority to review military decrees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the world struggles in the general direction of democratic reform and reconciliation, Nigeria, to determine of its people and indeed to all of Africa, is moving painfully on an opposite course. We are deeply saddened. We beseech you to expedite the restoration of democracy to Nigeria's 100 million people who yearn for it. To do less will result in incalculable damage to Africa's most populous nation and eventual global economic and political isolation of your regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sincerely,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On April 8, 1995, in Montreal, Canada, Mr. Amadou Diop, Director of The Rodale Institute Senegal received the Grand Prize of Excellence for the Senegal program's contribution to the African Cause in the Category of Development Aid. There were 2500 organizations nominated all throughout Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was the first year for the International Center of the African Cause in Montreal to hold this event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This award comes at an appropriate time as the Rodale Institute Senegal Team is working very hard to become its own independent organization.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Committee for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, will join UNICEF and the Organization for African Unity in commemorating the fifth annual Day of the African Child on June 16 to advocate for greater resources and public attention for Africa. As violence poses one of the greatest threats to African children, this year's Day of the African Child campaign will explore the theme of children in armed conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The 1995 Day of the African Child commemoration gives us the opportunity to draw attention to extraordinary challenges facing African children,&quot; stated Dr. Gwendolyn Calvert Baker, president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF. &quot;The U.S. Committee for UNICEF will work vigorously in its education, advocacy, and fundraising initiatives to ensure the survival, protection, and development of Africa's children and for children worldwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Children in Armed Conflict&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tragedy in Rwanda can be used as a benchmark from which to measure the impact of armed conflict on children. A study commissioned by UNICEF found that even a month after Rwandan children witnessed the bloody coup in their country, they were severely traumatized by what they experienced.  Seventy-five percent of the children interviewed in the UNICEF study had seen firsthand someone being killed, over half had seen a family member killed, and most had witnessed mass killings in schools, churches, and other areas.  Eighty percent of the children at some point had also feared for their own lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, there has been a rise in the number of conflict situations around the world. UNICEF finds that 80 percent of casualties from armed conflicts are civilians, mostly women and children. In the past decade, approximately two million children have been killed in armed conflicts, about 12 million have been left homeless, and more than one million have been orphaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many cases, children are not only victims as civilians, but also as soldiers. In Liberia, Somalia, and the Sudan, children as young as 10 years old are said to be familiar with the use of weapons. IN some areas 11-year-old boys have been conscripted or coerced into military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Fifth Year of Advocacy and Celebration&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As in previous years, the U.S. Committee for UNICEF and UNICEF-- with the support of religious and civic groups and non-governmental organizations-- will coordinate a variety of week-long cultural and educational programs culminating in United Nations reception on the evening of June 16. Many of the activities are open to the public and target children as well as adults.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the activities planned for this year's Day of the African Child are a children's event at the United Nations to help educate U.S.  schoolchildren about Africa's rich cultural heritage; an interfaith service on the morning of June 16; and a gala event where the U.S. Committee for UNICEF will present the Africa's Future Award to a prominent individual who has demonstrated a strong commitment to African and African-American children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How to Get Involved&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Individuals, groups, and business are encouraged to support the Day of the African Child by contributing to the U.S. Committee for UNICEF's Day of the African Child fund, currently supporting emergency and long-term development programs throughout the continent. The U.S. Committee is also accepting donations earmarked for relief efforts in Rwanda, Somalia, Zambia, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Liberia, and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the Audrey Hepburn Fund, established in honor of the late actress and beloved UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, promotes education initiatives for children in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Sudan. For more information on how to participate in the Day of the African Child or to make a contribution, call 1-800-For-KIDS, or contact the U.S. Committee for UNICEF at 333 East 38th St., New York, NY 10016, (212) 686-5522.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UCLA Public Information Office (Los Angeles)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lively, contemporary, painted African hairdressing signs from Gabon, Ghana, Kenya and Cote d'Ivoire comprise the exhibition, &quot;Coiffure Moderne: A Gallery of African Hairstyles, 1970-1990,&quot; at the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History in The William Goldenberg Galleria which continues through July 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approximately 50 painted, wooden signs vibrantly depict the latest hair fashions for men and women, combining concepts of art, culture and advertising in exuberant, eye-catching compositions. On one level, this selection of signs offers a varied study in the elegant, and often elaborate, arts of African hairstyling. In addition, the signs are themselves visually compelling works of art. Designed to attract patrons, the signs express contemporary ideals of fashion and status and reflect cultural aspirations and global influences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The works were created by artists from four major cities-- Liberville, Gabon; Kumase, Ghana; Nairobi, Kenya; and Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire-- for display outside barber shops, hair salons o haircutting stands. Painted in bright colors and varying greatly in style, the signs often feature several distinctly coiffured heads accompanied by catchy names such as &quot;Top Style,&quot; &quot;Zoulou Boy (Zulu),&quot; &quot;American Coiffure,&quot; or &quot;Diplomatic Haircut.&quot; Many of these signs are rendered in a playful, quirky manner; others are realized with straightforward, simple strokes; still others are painted with a graceful, almost tender, kind of realism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aesthetic value aside, these hairdressing signs are not just works of art-- this is art at work. For example, the dignified &quot;Mandela&quot; haircut, a reference to South African leader Nelson Mandela, appears on a sign painted by the acclaimed Abidjan-based artist Joel. Progressive, urban women are recognized as an economic force; one sign features the &quot;Student Cut,&quot; a no-nonsense hairstyle worn by a serious-looking young woman. The sleek &quot;Boeing 707&quot; haircut depicted on a sign from an artists' workshop in Kumase, Alpha and Omega Art Works, refers to a newer, a foreign culture of high-speed travel. Several other signs suggest faraway destinations and international enterprise with haircuts called &quot;Paris Dakar,&quot; &quot;Italian Draft&quot; or the &quot;Cincinnati Zip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exhibition also demonstrates just how global style and media have become and how current trends--mainly American--are integrated by these urban artists. Several signs identify styles using famous or terms, such as &quot;Grace Jonnes (Jones),&quot; &quot;RFK&quot; and &quot;House Party,&quot; among others. In these works, there is a strong emphasis on African and African-American cultural heroes or entertainment figures, including mentions of a sports idol, &quot;Mode Pele,&quot; and the rap group &quot;Kid'n Play.&quot; One sign features a likeness of actor Eddy Murphy sporting a suave haircut, titled &quot;Murphy Modelle Currency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, the hairstyles on the signs point out profound cultural links between African and African-American cultures and the dynamic nature of contemporary transcultural exchanges. Men's shaped cuts, popular among young adults in African-American communities in the late '80s were quickly embraced by African urban youth. Similarly, the elaborately braided women's hairstyle of the '80s and '90s were worn simultaneously by women in Africa and in America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hairdressing signs and other forms of commercial art have been part of the urban landscape in Africa since the 1930s. Many commercial signs are painted by self-trained artists, and the prices for hairdressing signs continue to be based on the number and size of the painted heads. Self-taught artist Joseph Bertiers of Nairobi began painting signs for beauty shops and other businesses in the early 1960s. In addition to presenting hairstyles, Bertiers' signs often depict the bustling activity of hairdressing salons, accompanied by humorous, often satirical quips. Over the years, he began producing works for the contemporary international art market as well. The reverse also occurs; in recent years, academically trained artists in Abidjan occasionally produce signs to supplement their incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the late 1960s, Bishok T. Pierre came to Liberville as a young sign painter. Today, there is hardly a barber shop or hairdressing salon in the city that does not display multiple paintings by the renowned artist. Like sign painters in other parts of Africa, Pierre now regularly copies photographs from a variety of fashion magazines and other publications in order to keep current with the latest styles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Working directly from photographs has changed how he renders his images. From the relatively flat profiles of earlier work, Pierre has moved to three-quarter poses, as well as paintings of full figures, which he renders more realistically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sign-painting ateliers have been established in many urban centers in Africa. Often the painters sign their name or a nickname, or they use the name of the atelier on the paintings, such as &quot;Unity Best Art,&quot; &quot;Double-Do Art,&quot; &quot;Almighty God Art&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Father Cuts.&quot; One sign, bearing the &quot;Heavenly Father Cuts&quot; imprint in the corner, titles one particular haircut &quot;God's Gift.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Curated by Fowler Museum Deputy Director Doran H. Ross, an African-art historian and curator of the museum's African collections, the exhibition was organized by the UCLA Fowler Museum and includes objects selected from the museum's holdings, as well as from several private collections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Coiffure Moderne&quot; is presented in conjunction with its companion exhibition, &quot;Crowning Achievements: African Arts of Dressing the Head,&quot; which features traditional and contemporary hats, headdresses and hairstyles. Like hair, hats are excellent vehicles for visual expression that can be used to construct one's social identity, and to enhance and transform one's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UCLA Fowler Museum has planned extensive public programming to complement both &quot;Coiffure Moderne&quot; and &quot;Crowning Achievements,&quot; including lectures, African hair braiding demonstrations, children's storytelling, gallery talks and teachers' workshops, among other events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UCLA Fowler Museum's hours are Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 5 p.m., Thursday until 8 p.m. Admission is free. For general information, the public should call (310) 825-4361.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A REPORT RELEASED IN WASHINGTON TUESDAY AND QUOTED BY THE WASHINGTON LINE, A STATE DEPARTMENT NEWSLETTER, SAYS THE MOMENTUM IS DUE TO A NEAR UNIVERSAL PUSH TOWARDS TRADE AND CAPITAL MARKET LIBERALISATION AND INTERNATIONAL CORPORATE STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLGICAL CHANGE.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHEN THE ZCTU REALISED THAT ZIMBABWE'S ECONOMIC STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMME (ESAP) INTRODUCED BY THE GOVERNMENT IN 1990 WOULD COST A LOT OF JOBS, IT SET UP A REVOLVING FUND FOR THE EXERCISE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SO FAR IT HAS RAISED THE &quot;SEED MONEY&quot; TOTALLING ZIMDOLLARS 300,000 (USD 37 500) DONATED BY THE NORWEGIAN PEOPLE'S RELIEF ASSOCIATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ZCTU HAS DISBURSED ZD 200 000 (USD 25 000) TO FOUR COMPANIES, BENEFITING MORE THAN 60 WORKERS SINCE ITS EMPLOYMENT CREATION UNIT BECAME OPERATIONAL IN 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NOW A TOTAL OF 30 532 EMPLOYEES HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS IN BOTH THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OF ZIMBABWE'S 10.5 MILLION PEOPLE, A TOTAL OF TWO MILLION ARE UNEMPLOYED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARD HIT ARE SOME 300 000 SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO JOIN THE LABOUR MARKET ANNUALLY. ONLY 30 000 OR SO ARE ABSORBED INTO THE NATIONAL WORK FORCE.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE REVOLVING FUND, WHOSE IDEA ZCTU MOOTED IN 1991, IS OPEN TO INDIVIDUAL TRADERS, PARTNERSHIP ENTERPRISES AND CO-OPERATIVE VENTURES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE INTEREST ON THE LOAN, PAYABLE OVER FOUR YEARS WITH A THREE-MONTH GRACE PERIOD, HAS BEEN SET AT 20 PERCENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT IS TAKEN AS PART OF COLLATERAL, AND THE MACHINERY REMAINS ZCTU PROPERTY UNTIL THE LOAN IS REPAID IN FULL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE INSURANCE AGAINST FIRES AND BURGLARIES WILL BE CONSIDERED AS ADDITIONAL SECURITY IN FUTURE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AS OF NOW, TWO PARTNERS IN A FIRM WHICH MAKES FOLDERS, BUSINESS CARDS, BIBLE COVERS AND BRIEFCASES SECURED A LOAN OF ZD 45 000 (USD 5 625), AND CREATED EMPLOYMENT FOR 15 PEOPLE AT THEIR PREMISES IN WATERFALLS, HARARE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALSO IN WATERFALLS, TWO PARTNERS IN A COMPANY WHICH MANUFACTURES SOCCER BALLS, VOLLEY BALLS, RUGBY BALLS, TENNIS BALL NETS AND SATCHELS HAVE CREATED JOBS FOR 15 PEOPLE WITH A LOAN OF ZD 25 000 (USD 3 125).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE TRADER IN MUFAKOSE, HARARE, CREATED EMPLOYMENT FOR EIGHT PEOPLE WITH A GRANT OF ZD 60 000 (USD 7 500) TO MANUFACTURE SHOES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANOTHER TRADER AT A GOLD MINE NEAR THE SECOND LARGEST CITY OF BULAWAYO HAS CREATED JOBS FOR 19 PEOPLE WITH A GRANT OF ZD 70 000 (USD 8 750).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS YEAR THE TRUSTEES HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO FUND 10 PROJECTS FOR WOMEN BECAUSE THEY ARE DISADVANTAGED ON THE MONEY MARKET, YET THEIR LOAN REPAYMENT RECORD OF 75 PERCENT FAR OUTSTRIPS THAT OF MEN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ZCTU, WHICH HAS 29 AFFILLIATES, WILL TRY TO PERSUADE THE GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE SOME OF THE SOCIAL DIMENSIONS FUND (SDF) MONEY TO SPONSOR PROJECTS WHICH IT WILL HAVE APPROVED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SDF HAS FINANCED 1 195 PROJECTS WORTH ZD 89,3 MILLION (USD 11 162 500), CREATING JOBS FOR 5 032 PEOPLE SINCE 1990.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY MUSENGWA KAYAYA, PANA STAFF CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT HAS OFFERED ITS SHARES IN THE COUNTRY'S SOLE CEMENT MANUFACTURING COMPANY, CHILANGA CEMENT, FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC UNDER THE COUNTRY'S CURRENT PRIVATISATION OF STATE-OWNED COMPANIES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE GOVERNMENT HAS TRANSFERRED SOME 54,750,970 ORDINARY SHARES TO THE ZAMBIA PRIVATISATION TRUST FUND (ZPTF) WHICH WILL EFFECT THE SALES TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH THE LUSAKA STOCK EXCHANGE (LUSE) ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHILANGA CEMENT WAS BOUGHT OFF IN 1994 BY THE COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (CDC) BUT GOVERNMENT RETAINED SOME SHARES WHICH IT IS NOW DISPOSING OFF.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCORDING TO A PROSPECTUS RELEASED BY THE ZPTF TUESDAY IN LUSAKA TUESDAY, THE OFFER IS OPEN ONLY TO ZAMBIAN CITIZENS AND OTHER PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS TO BE SPECIFIED BY GOVERNMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHILANGA CEMENT PRODUCES ABOUT 500,000 TONNES OF CEMENT PER YEAR FROM ITS TWO PLANTS IN CHILANGA, SOUTH OF THE CAPITAL LUSAKA, AND NDOLA IN THE NORTHERN COPPERBELT REGION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCORDING TO THE LATEST AVAILABLE DATA, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT 65 PERCENT CAPACITY AND GEOLOGICAL FORECASTS INDICATE THAT LIMESTONE RESERVES, THE MAJOR INPUT, ARE EXPECTED TO LAST FOR THE NEXT 40 YEARS IN THE CHILANGA AND 60 YEARS IN NDOLA AREAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT EMBARKED ON THE PRIVATISATION PROGRAMME IN 1992 FOLLOWING ADOPTION OF AN IMF-DRIVEN STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMME (SAP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHILANGA IS AMONG SOME OF ZAMBIA'S MAJOR FORMER STATE ENTERPRISES BEING TRANSFERRED INTO PRIVATE HANDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZAMBIA BREWERIES, BREWERS OF BOTTLE BEER, WAS TAKEN OVER BY A SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM IN 1994.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOVERNMENT HAS SET ITSELF A TARGET TO SELL OFF SOME 20 STATE FIRMS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APRIL 18, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY ABDOULAYE TRAORE, PANA CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MINING HAS RECEIVED A MAJOR BOOST IN MALI AS THE COUNTRY'S GOLD INDUSTRY TAKES ON A NEW IMPORTANCE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN THE 18TH CENTURY, IN THE HEYDAY OF THE MALI EMPIRE, THE COUNTRY'S GOLD WAS HELD BY THE OF KINGS AND PRINCES OF THE MANDING. IN COLONIAL DAYS, IT TURNED SEVERAL EUROPEANS INTO WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO CAME TO THRIVE IN WHAT WAS THEN FRENCH SUDAN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFTER INDEPENDENCE (1960), PRESIDENT MODIBO KEITA, A SOCIALIST, WANTED TO STEM THE OUTFLOW OF GOLD PROFITS TOWARDS THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND ALLOW MALI BENEFIT MORE FROM THE RESOURCE.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE SOUGHT AND OBTAINED THE SUPPORT OF THE SOVIET UNION AND PUT IN PLACE A STATE ENTERPRISE, THE 'NATIONAL COMPANY FOR MINING RESEARCH AND EXPLOITATION' (SONAREM) WHICH REPLACED THE (FRENCH) BUREAU OF GEOLOGICAL AND MINING RESEARCH (BRGM) PREVIOUSLY IN CHARGE OF GOLD MINING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNFORTUNATELY, THE INITIATIVE DID NOT PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULT. GOLD PRODUCTION STARTED SUFFERING FROM MISMANAGEMENT AND BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE, LIKE MANY OTHER STATE ENTERPRISES IN AFRICA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WITH THE 1968 MILITARY COUP WHICH BROUGHT PRESIDENT MOUSSA TRAORE INTO POWER, MALI FELT OBLIGED TO OPEN UP THE GOLD SECTOR TO PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.  THE INDUSTRY HAD FALLEDN INTO DECLINE AND THE ONLY MAJOR PRODUCER WAS KALANA, RUN BY THE STATE AND ITS SOVIET PARTNERS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT EQUIPMENT AT THE MINE HAD BEEN BADLY MAINTAINED WHILE THERE WAS ALSO OVER-EMPLOYMENT WITH SOME 600 WORKERS FOR AN ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF LESS THAN THREE TONNES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE CURRENT MALIAN GOVERNMENT, BORN OUT OF DEMOCRATIC ELECTIONS IN 1992, IS DETERMINED TO FACILITATE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THE MINING SECTOR, OFFICIAL SOURCES SAY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE INITIATIVE SEEMS TO BE BEARING FRUIT AS MAJOR COMPANIES, INLCUDING THE GIANT ANGLO-AMERICA, INVEST IN GOLD EXPLORATION IN THE COUNTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OPTIMISIM IS HIGH, AS THE PRIME MINISTER IBRAHIM BOUBACAR KEITA, IN DESCRIBING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN MALI, SAYS &quot;ALL LIGHTS ARE GREEN&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE COUNTRY IS ALSO DOING WELL IN OTHER SECTORS. AT 26 PER CENT, INFLATION IS, ACCORDING TO THE FINANCE MINISTER, SOUMAILA CISSE, NOT TOO BAD -- CONSIDERING THE DEVALUATION OF THE CFA IN JANUARY 1994. THE CURRENCY IS USED IN MOST OF FRENCH-SPEAKING AFRICA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MALIAN EXPORTS ARE DOING WELL. CATTLE EXPORTS, A MAJOR SOURCE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, DOUBLED TO 41.6 BILLION F CFA (480 CFA = ONE US DOLLAR) IN 1994 AS AGAINST 20 BILLION IN 1993, AMADOU BA, OF THE MALIAN CATTLE AND MEAT OFFICE (OMBEVI) SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE HEAD OF STATE, ALPHA OUMAR KONARE, SAID LAST YEAR THAT MALI HAD PAID OVER 70 BILLION F CFA OF ITS EXTERNAL DEBT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE MONTH AGO, THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK TO HONOUR AN INTERNAL DEBT OF ABOUT 41 BILLION F CFA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CROPS HAVE ALSO DONE WELL THIS YEAR. THE PRODUCTION OF COTTON, THE COUNTRY'S MAIN EXPORT, WILL FOR THE FIRST TIME GO BEYOND THE RECORD 350,000 TONNES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT CROPS AS A WHOLE REMAIN EXPOSED TO THE VAGARIES OF THE WEATHER AND LOCUST INVASIONS. THIS HAS, IN SOME QUARTERS, JUSTIFIED THE SIGNIFICANCE NOW GIVEN TO GOLD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE POLICY FOR THE SECTOR IS TO MOVE TOWARDS A POLICY TO MAKE THE MINING INDUSTRY ATTRACTIVE FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS, WHILE LEAVING PART OF THE WEALTH CREATED IN THE COUNTRY, MORY KANE, THE MINING MINISTER SAYS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOLD RESERVES IN MALI ARE ESTIMATED AT SOME 353 TONNES. PRODUCTION, AT AROUND THREE TONNES IN 1994, IS EXPECTED TO DOUBLE THIS YEAR TO SIX TONNES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TWENTY THREE EXPLORATION AND MINING LICENCES WERE GRANTED IN 1994 TO PRIVATE, MALIAN AND FOREIGN OPERATORS. MALI SEEMS CERTAINLY SET FOR SOME GOLD BOOM.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, SENEGAL (PANA) - BURUNDI AND RWANDA, TWO COUNTRIES WITH A SIMILAR MIX OF COMBUSTIBLE POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ETHNIC FACTORS, ARE SEEMINGLY ALWAYS IN THE NEWS THESE DAYS. THEIR WOES AND THOSE BETWEEN SUDAN AND UGANDA WERE PARTLY THE FOCUS OF THE AFRICAN MEDIA THIS WEEK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE &quot;KENYA TIMES&quot; BLAMED THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY (OAU) AND AFRICAN LEADERS FOR FAILING TO ACT FORCEFULLY IN BURUNDI AND PREVIOUSLY IN NEIGHBOURING RWANDA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT IS TIME AFRICAN LEADERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER AND PREVENTED ANOTHER BLOODBATH IN BURUNDI,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE OAU SHOULD SPEARHEAD THE CAMPAIGN FOR RECONCILIATION AND EMPHASISE ON AFRICAN SOLUTIONS INSTEAD OF INVITING FOREIGN PEACEKEEPERS,&quot; IT ADDED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACKNOWLEDGING THE PRESENCE OF AN OAU PEACE MISSION WHICH ARRIVED IN BURUNDI WEDNESDAY, IT REMINDED THE BODY OF FOREIGN MINISTERS &quot;TO CONSIDER THE PLIGHT OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES WHO KEEP MOVING IN SEARCH OF SHELTER.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT SAID: &quot;THIS TIME ROUND, THE OAU MUST ENDEAVOUR TO RECONCILE THE TUTSI AND THE HUTU (SO THEY WILL) UNDERSTAND THAT KILLING ONE ANOTHER HAS FAILED TO RESOLVE WHATEVER DISPUTE THERE IS BETWEEN THEM, AND MUST JUST LEARN TO LIVE WITH EACH OTHER AND CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE OF TOLERANCE AND CO-EXISTENCE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE SAME PAGE IS AN ARTIST'S CONCEPTION OF NEVER-ENDING WARS IN AFRICA. IN THE CARTOON, SEGMENTED INTO THREE, THE ARTIST BEGINS WITH KENYA AND RWANDA STANDING TOGETHER. A BELLICOSE KENYA IS SHOWN SHOUTING A THE TOP OF ITS VOICE. SEGMENT TWO HAS RWANDAN'S HEAD CHOPPED OFF AND A VERY SHOCKED KENYA LOOKING ON. THE THIRD PART SHOWS KENYA, APPARENTLY HAVING RECOVERED FROM THE SHOCK, STILL SHOUTING AND POOR RWANDA LYING DEAD NEXT TO HER.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ORGANISATION 'REPORTERS SANS FRONTIERES' (REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS) ATTRACTED CRITICISM FOR ADVOCATING A BAN ON WHAT IT SAID WERE EXTREMIST NEWSPAPSERS IN BURUNDI, SUCH AS 'L'ETOILE'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THEY CALL US ASSASSINS OVER ALL RADIO STATIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND COMPARE US TO THE INFAMOUS RADIO AND TELEVISION STATION 'MILLES COLLINES' IN RWANDA AND TO THE 'KANGURA' NEWSPAPER,&quot; BUJUMBURA'S 'L'ETOILE' SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PARADOXICALLY, THE PAPER ADDED, &quot;WHEN THOSE TWO MEDIA ORGANISATIONS WERE PREPARING FOR THE RWANDAN HOLOCAUST, 'REPORTERS SANS FRONTIERES' APPLAUDED AND GAVE THEIR BLESSING TO WHAT THEY CALLED THE EMERGENCE OF A FREE PRESS,&quot; IT SAID. IT ACCUSED THE ORGANISATION, A MOSTLY WEST EUROPEAN GROUP, OF SEEKING PUBLICITY AND OF &quot;NURTURING CERTAIN PATERNALISTIC ATTITUDES.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THEN, L'ETOILE CHALLENGED &quot;THESE ADVENTURERS&quot; TO FIND A SINGLE ARTICLE WHERE IT CALLED ON HUTUS AND TUTSIS TO KILL EACH OTHER.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IF THE GOVERNMENT BANS US, WE WILL GO UNDERGROUND. THEN, CRITICISM AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE MUCH STRONGER, IF IT IS STILL IN POWER,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AS RWANDA LAST WEEK MARKED THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE START OF GENOCIDE IN WHICH SOME 500,000 PEOPLE WERE HACKED OR SHOT TO DEATH, THE UGANDAN PRESS CALLED FOR FAIR TRIALS OF THE ALLEGED KILLERS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WHAT IS NEEDED IN RWANDA NOW IS FOR ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE TO EXERCISE MAXIMUM IMPARTIALITY AND PROFESSIONALISM AS A WAY OF BUILDING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE FRAGILE SYSTEM,&quot; STATE-OWNED NEW VISION SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT ADDED THAT SINCE THE TRIALS WOULD ALSO INTEREST NON-RWANDANS, &quot;IMPARTIALITY WILL NOT ONLY CALM THE ANGER OF THOSE ITCHING FOR REVENGE BUT WILL ALSO REASSURE THOSE MILLIONS OF REFUGEES OUTSIDE TO RETURN HOME AND EXPECT FAIR TRIALS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TURNING TO UGANDA'S RELATIONS WITH SUDAN, IT FOCUSED ON TALKS IN TRIPOLI, LIBYA, EARLY APRIL IN WHICH AN ACCORD TO SETTLE THE ROW WAS WORKED OUT. THAT DEVELOPED OUT OF MUTUAL ACCUSATIONS OF HELPING REBELS ATTACK THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT OF EACH COUNTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THIS IS A WELCOME MOVE THAT SHOULD REMOVE A THORN THAT HAS PERSISTENTLY SOURED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBOURS,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE ACCUSATIONS, ACCURATE OR OTHERWISE, HAVE UNDERMINED EFFORTS TO RESTORE REGIONAL HARMONY AND HAVE PRECIPITATED ACTIONS LIKE THE BOMBING OF PARTS OF NORTHERN UGANDA THAT DISRUPT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN VIEW OF CONSTANT BICKERING BETWEEN KENYA AND UGANDA, KAMPALA'S INDEPENDENT TRI-WEEKLY PAPER 'THE MONITOR' APPEALED TO THE UGANDA GOVERNMENT TO OPEN ITS MUCH TALKED ABOUT SEA ROUTE VIA DAR-ES-SALAAM RATHER THAN RELY ON THE KENYAN PORT OF MOMBASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;KENYAN LEADERS HAVE NOT, IN THE LEAST, BEEN TAMED BY THE PERENNIAL THREATS. PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH A SIDE THAT TALKS A LOT AND DOES LITTLE,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT NOTED A HOST OF REASONS WHY KENYA MIGHT FEEL DUTY- BOUND TO DO WITH THEIR SEA ROUTE: GOOD NEIGHBOURLINESS, RESPECTING THE ECONOMIC SENSE OF KEEPING THE ROUTE OPEN, AND UGANDA'S INTERNATIONAL RIGHT OF ACCESS TO THE SEA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;BUT EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THOSE NAIROBI CHIEFS CAN AT TIMES BE QUITE UNREASONABLE,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT WOULD, THREFORE, BE SILLY FOR UGANDA TO BE BLINDED BY THESE ASPECTS OF THE ARGUMENT AND LOSE SIGHT OF THE SIMPLE LOGIC AND EXPECTATIONS OF POSSIBLE NATURAL DISASTERS AND EVEN WAR. UGANDA AS AN INTERESTED PARTY SHOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE TANZANIA GOVERNMENT TO DEVELOP THE DAR-ES-SALAAM OR TANGA ROUTE,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AGED OVER 65 WILL REACH 326 MILLION WITHIN 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHOM WILL LIVE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ACCORDING TO ESTIMATES FROM THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SENIOR WOMEN ARE OFTEN CONFRONTED WITH DISABILITIES, CHRONIC DISEASES, POVERTY, LONELINESS AND ALIENATION, SAID A WHO STUDY MADE PUBLIC MONDAY AT THE WHO HEADQUARTERS IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOWEVER, THE DISEASE CAN BE AVOIDED THROUGH PREVENTIVE MEASURES.  SYSTEMATIC SCREENING EVERY FIVE YEARS CAN CAUSE AN 85 PER CENT REDUCTION OF MORTALITY DUE TO THE CANCER, THE STUDY EXPLAINED.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY MILDRED MULENGA, PANA STAFF CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A HIGH POTENCY APHRODISIAC INTRODUCED IN ZAMBIA A FORTHIGHT AGO HAS BEEN BANNED BY THE COUNTRY'S PHARMACY AND POISONS BOARD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE DRUG, 'MALE FORMULA', IS WHEN TAKEN OVER THIRTY DAYS WITH A DOSAGE OF TWO TABLETS PER DAY SUPPOSED TO ENABLE MEN PERFORM SEX &quot;ALL NIGHT LONG&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT IS SAID TO INCREASE SPERM COUNT, ALLEVIATE MALE FERTILITY PROBLEMS AND STIMULATE BOTH MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ENERGY.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A FEMALE VERSION THE APHRODISIAC, THE 'FEMALE FORMULA', ALSO SAID TO REJUVENATE WOMEN SEXUALLY, WAS ALSO ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT ON THE ZAMBIAN MARKET BY A PRIVATE LUSAKA FIRM, 'NODA INVESTMENTS'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZAMBIA'S PHARMACY AND POISONS BOARD, TUESDAY IN LUSAKA ORDERED THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE MARKET OF 'MALE FORMULA', SAYING ITS CLINICAL CONTENTS HAD NOT BEEN VERIFIED BY PHARMACEUTICAL EXPERTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE DRUG, MANUFACTURED BY A UNITED STATES COMPANY, CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTORS WAS SUPPLIED THROUGH A SOUTH-AFRICAN-BASED COMPANY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCORDING TO THE SUPPLIERS, THE DRUG CONTAINS VITAMIN B1 (THIAMINE), VITAMIN B2 (RIBOFLOVINE) AND CALCIUM PANLOTHENATE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNDER ZAMBIAN LAW, NO MEDICINE CAN BE IMPORTED OR MANUFACTURED UNTIL IT IS PASSED BY THE PHARMACY AND POISONS BOARD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCORDING TO NODA PROPRIETOR, MACDONALD NKABIKA, THE DRUG IS BEST FOR SEXUALLY TIRED AND OVER-WORKED MEN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;MARRIAGES HAVE BROKEN UP BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE FAILED TO PERFORM SEXUALLY BUT THOSE WHO WILL TAKE THIS FORMULA WILL BE ASSURED OF A RESTORATION BECAUSE NATURALLY THE MAN WILL BE PHYSICALLY STIMULATED,&quot; NKABIKA HAD EARLIER CLAIMED IN HIS ADVERTISEMENTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE CLAIMED THE FEMALE FORMULA STOPS IRRITABLE DISCHARGES FROM WOMEN AND ACTIVATES THEIR SEXUAL DESIRE, REDUCED IN SOME WOMEN AFTER PROLONGED CONSUMPTION OF BIRTH CONTROL PILLS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NKABIKA HAS PROTESTED THE BAN OF THE DRUG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE CLAIMED IN LUSAKA WEDNESDAY THERE HAD BEEN A &quot;TREMENDOUS&quot; DEMAND FOR THE DRUG SOLD AT 15,000 KWACHA (ABOUT 20 UNITED STATES DOLLARS) A COURSE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HERBAL APHRODISIACS ARE POPULAR AMONG BOTH MEN AND WOMEN IN ZAMBIAN CITIES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEDICAL EXPERTS CONSULTED BY PANA IN LUSAKA WEDNESDAY SAID AS FAR AS THEY KNEW, THERE IS STILL NO MEDICINE THAT BOOSTS ONE'S SEXUAL PERFORMANCE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THEY SAID SEX IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION WHOSE SUCCESFUL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, MENTAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER FACTORS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NKABIKA'S 'NODA INVESTMENTS' TRADITIONALLY SELLS HYGIENE AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD GOODS UNDER THE TRADE NAME 'MOTHER OF HYGIENE'.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MARY IS A SEVEN-MONTH-OLD ORPHAN NOW BEING CARED FOR BY FOSTER PARENTS IN THE HIGH DENSITY SUBURB OF MKOBA IN ZIMBABWE'S MIDLANDS CAPITAL, GWERU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HER PARENTS DIED THREE MONTHS AGO OF ACQUIRED IMMUNO-DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) LEAVING THE INFANT WITH NO RELATIVE PREPARED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HER UPKEEP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT A SINGLE MOTHER WHO KNEW HER PARENTS VOLUNTEERED TO LOOK AFTER THE CHILD, RECEIVING ASSISTANCE FROM A LOCAL HEALTH CENTRE AND A NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATION IN THE FORM OF FOOD AND CLOTHING.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MARY IS NOW AMONG MORE THAN 100 CHILDREN IN AND AROUND GWERU IN CENTRAL ZIMBABWE,BORN TO TERMINALLY-ILL PARENTS WHO EVENTUALLY DIE LEAVING THEIR OFFSPRING HOMELESS DESTITUTES, ALSO BOUND FOR THE GRAVE IN MOST CASES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SIXTY THOUSAND CHILDREN AGED BELOW 15 YEARS HAD BEEN ORPHANED IN ZIMBABWE BY THE END OF 1993 AS A RESULT OF THE DEATH OF BOTH PARENTS FROM AIDS AND OTHER KILLER DISEASES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOST OF THEM WERE LEFT IN THE CARE OF DESTITUTE GRANDPARENTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALTHOUGH STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND SOME NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS TO GIVE ASSISTANCE, THIS IS NOT ENOUGH.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOWEVER, A HOME-BASED CARE PROGRAMME JOINTLY LAUNCHED BY THE GWERU CITY COUNCIL AND THE MIDLANDS AIDS SUPPORT ORGANISATION (MASO), COULD BE THE WAY OUT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PROGRAMME, INITIATED IN NOVEMBER 1992, WAS OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED IN JULY 1994 BY A GROUP OF 15 WOMEN IN GWERU WHO OFFERED TO PROVIDE CARE TO TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABOUT 100 WOMEN, MAINLY VOLUNTEERS, WERE TRAINED BY MASO AND THE GWERU CITY COUNCIL BUT ONLY 15 REMAINED WHILE THE REST DROPPED OUT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS FIGURE HAS NOW RISEN TO 35 AS MORE WOMEN VOLUNTEERS ARE NOW TAKING AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN THE PROGRAMME.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOME-CARE CO-ORDINATOR FOR THE GWERU CITY COUNCIL, NURSING SISTER DIANA MAKWINDI, SAYS NURSES PROVIDE HOME VISITING SERVICES TO THE SICK AND TO THE ORPHANS AS PART OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES IN THEIR AREAS OF OPERATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WE ARE TRYING TO SOURCE FUNDS FROM THE CHILD SURVIVAL AND DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION SO THAT WE CAN ESTABLISH A SOCIAL WELFARE FUND TO ASSIST ORPHANS, TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS AND THE POOR,&quot; EXPLAINS MAKWINDI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHE SAYS 54 TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AT GWERU GENERAL HOSPITAL WHILE 39 WERE BEING CARED FOR BY THE COMMUNITY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT AS MORE AND MORE TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS DIE IN GWERU, SAYS MAKWINDI, THE PROBLEM OF ORPHANS RISES BY THE DAY BECAUSE THEY NEED FOOD, CLOTHING AND ACCOMMODATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JANET MADAMOMBE, WHO HAS ASSISTED FOUR FAMILIES, SAYS SHE IS NO LONGER VIEWED AS A VISITOR IN THE HOMES WHERE SHE IS COUNSELLING PATIENTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE PATIENT WHO SPOKE ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY SAID THE HOME-BASED CARE PROGRAMME WAS THE BEST THING WHICH COULD EVER HAPPEN TO TERMINALLY-ILL PATIENTS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APRIL 12, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY MUSENGWA KAYAYA, PANA STAFF CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WORLD'S 18 MILLION REFUGEES ARE AMONG PEOPLE WHO RARELY RECEIVE FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES, ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES-BASED &quot;FAMILY HEALTH INTERNATIONAL&quot; (FHI).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE NON-PROFIT RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ORGANISATION, SAYS THAT WHILE PROVIDING FOOD, SHELTER AND MEDICAL CARE ARE INITIALLY VITAL IN ASSISTING REFUGEES, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT AFTER BASIC NEEDS ARE MET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;EVERN IN CRISIS SITUATIONS, PEOPLE ARE STILL SEXUALLY ACTIVE, AND THUS, MANY ARE STILL EXPOSED TO UNWANTED PREGNANCY OR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES,&quot; SAYS BEVERLY TUCKER, AN FHI ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF FIELD OPERATIONS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE FHI MOSTLY CONCERNS ITSELF WITH FAMILY PLANNING ISSUES AND HIV/AIDS AROUD THE WORLD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TUCKER IS REPORTED IN THE LATEST FHI QUARTERLY &quot;NETWORK MAGAZINE&quot; AS SAYING THAT SOME REFUGEES LIVE FOR MANY YEARS IN REFUEE CAMPS WHERE YOUNGER PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO RESORT TO SEXUAL ENCOUNTERS FOR LACK OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WOMEN PARTICULARLY ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO BY USING SEXUAL FAVOURS TO OBTAIN FOOD OR OTHER NEEDS FROM OFFICIALS INCHARGE OF REFUGEE CAMPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A REPORT FROM THE WOMEN'S COMMISSION FOR REFUGEE WOMEN AND CHILDREN QUOTED BY THE MAGAZINE RECOMMENDS THAT RELIEF AGENCIES STRENGTHEN ALL FACETS OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES FOR WOMEN, INCLUDING TRAINING OF BIRTH ATTENDANTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT RECOMMENDED THAT WOMEN REFUGEES BE PROVIDED WITH CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES AND TREATED FOR SEXUALLY TRANSIMITTED DISEASES AND PROTECTED FROM UNSAFE ABORTIONS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FHI ALSO STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY PLANNING AND COUNSELLING FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE JUST GIVEN BIRTH OR HAVE LOST A PREGNANCY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CHILDBIRTH IS AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH WOMEN TO OBTAIN FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND COUNSELING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEANWHILE THE FHI SAYS THAT SCIENTISTS ARE EXPLORING A VARIETY OF WAYS TO GIVE MEN NEW METHODS OF REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION, INCLUDING CONTRACEPTIVE INJECTIONS, PILLS AND SKIN IMPLANTS. OTHER METHODS ARE PATCHES OR CREAMS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT SAYS HOWEVER THAT DESPITE THE INVESTIGATIONS, IT WILL BE MANY MORE YEARS BEFORE ANY OF THE METHODS ARE PERFECTED FOR GENERAL USE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FHI CORPORATE MEDICAL DIRECTOR DR WILLIAM GATES SAYS FOR THE TIME BEING MEN SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO USE THE EXISTING METHODS OF CONDOMS AND VASECTOMY INCLUDING THE NATURAL METHODS OF PERIODIC ABSTINENCE OR THE &quot;RYTHM METHOD.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO EDUCATE AND SHOW MEN THAT INVOLVEMENT IN FAMILY PLANNING AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WILL SERVE THEIR INTERESTS AS MEN.  ECONOMICALLY, THEY WILL HAVE FEWER CHILDREN TO SUPPORT AND THE LIVES OF THEIR WIVES WILL BE BETTER WITH FEWER CHILDREN,&quot; ACCORDING TO DR GATES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEN ARE CONSIDERED AS ANOTHER GROUP WHO ARE NOT &quot;TYPICAL&quot; FAMILY PLANNING CLIENTS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A GROWING NUMBER OF MINING COMPANIES, SOME AMONG THE WORLD'S BIGGEST, ARE SHOWING A GROWING INTEREST IN EXPLORING FOR GOLD IN MALI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE LAST ONE TO HAVE ESTABLISHED ITSELF IN MALI, THE BARRICK GOLD CORPORATION COMPANY OF NORTH-AMERICA HAS OBTAINED EXPLORATION LICENCES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR AN INVESTMENT OF OVER 5.2 MILLION DOLLARS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE TWO PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE OVER 100 JOBS IN IN KADIOLA, SOUTHERN MALI, AND KENIEBA IN THE WEST.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WE ARE PLANNING TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS AND WE HOPE TO MAKE MALI OUR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLE,&quot; THE FORMER CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER, BRIAN MULRONEY, NOW CHAIRMAN AT THE BARRICK GOLD CORPORATION SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN FEBRUARY, REPORTS FROM THE MALIAN CAPITAL SAID TWO SOUTH AFRICAN COMPANIES HAD RECEIVED EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION LICENCES FOR THE COUNTRY'S WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE OF THEM, THE RAND GOLD COMPANY WILL, UNDER ITS LICENCE, OPERATE IN THE LOCALITIES OF KEREKOTO I AND II (KENIEBA ZONE). THE OTHER ONE IS THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CORPORATION WHICH, ACCORDING TO INFORMED SOURCES, IS THE LEADING GOLD-PRODUCER IN THE WORLD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SOUTH AFRICAN GIANT WILL OPERATE IN SADIOLA IN THE SOUTH WHERE IT PLANS TO INVEST 1.5 BILLION CFA FRANCS (480 F CFA = 1 US DOLLAR). IT IS EXPECTED TO MINE 116 TONNES OF GOLD IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS, MORY KANE FROM THE MALIAN GOVERNMENT SAID.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMBABWE'S NATIONAL EXPORT BODY, ZIMTRADE, HAS BLAMED THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OF FAVOURING LARGE EXPORTERS BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR LOANS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNDER ITS OFFSHORE EXPORT CREDIT FINANCE SCHEME,THE MINIMUM AMOUNT AN EXPORTER CAN APPLY FOR IS ZIMDOLLAR 4.25 MILLION (500,000 US DOLLARS), BUT ZIMBABWEAN SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZE COMPANIES SAY THIS IS UNFAIR AS IT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST THEM.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT SEEMS TO EXCLUDE NEW EXPORTERS WHO BADLY NEED THE RESOURCES. BUT WE FEEL THIS FACILITY SHOULD BE BROADENED BY MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE TO SMALL SCALE EXPORTERS,&quot; SAID ZIMTRADE CHIEF EXECUTIVE, MORRISON SIFELANI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNDER THE SCHEME, THE FINANCE IS AVAILABLE THROUGH SOME OF THE LOCAL MERCHANT AND COMMERCIAL BANKS. THE FINANCE IS PROVIDED AS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDED TO FULFILL AN EXPORT ORDER.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALTHOUGH INTEREST RATES (CURRENTLY AROUND 10 PER CENT) FLACTUATE FROM TIME TO TIME, THEY ARE WELL BELOW THOSE ON THE LOCAL MONEY MARKET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SIFELANI WOULD NOT SAY WHAT ZIMTRADE WANTED AS THE MINIMUM AN EXPORTER COULD APPLY FOR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT SHOULD BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE EACH CASE MUST BE EVALUATED ON ITS MERIT,&quot; HE SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMTRADE WAS ALSO PUSHING FOR THE SETTING UP OF A &quot;NON-ORTHODOX&quot; BANK SYMPATHETIC TO THE NEEDS OF ENTREPRENEURS ASPIRING TO BREAK INTO THE EXPORT MARKET.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APRIL 11, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY DOMINIC ETE-DANIEL, PANA CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A MAJOR STEP AT DIVERSIFYING NIGERIA'S OIL-DEPENDENT ECONOMY WAS THE RECENT CREATION OF A MINISTRY FOR SOLID MINERALS DEVELOPMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE NEW MINISTER KALOMA ALI ON ASSUMING DUTY IN MARCH PLEDGED TO EVOLVE A POLICY THAT WILL GIVE DIRECTION TO NIGERIA'S MINING SECTOR AND PROVIDE AN ENABLING INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE BIRTH OF THE SOLID MINERAL MINISTRY FOLLOWED A MINING WORKSHOP HELD IN NIGERIA'S CENTRAL MINING CITY OF JOS IN NOVEMBER 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WORKSHOP HAD RECOMMENDED THE CREATION OF AN INVESTMENT BANK TO CATER FOR THE NEEDS OF NIGERIA'S MINING COMMUNITY.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE CREATION OF THE MINISTRY HAS HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS THAT THE REACTIVATION OF NIGERIA'S SOLID MINERALS SECTOR WILL GIVE AN IMMEDIATE BOOST TO THE COUNTRY'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALREADY MANY INVESTMENT PROPOSALS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED FOR FUNDING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN THE COAL INDUSTRY FOR INSTANCE, THE NIGERIAN COAL CORPARATION (NSS) IN 1994 SUBMITTED A THREE-YEAR ROLLING PLAN FOR 1995-1997, TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE 1.3 BILLION-NAIRA PROPOSAL IS FOR THE REHABILITATION AND MODERNISATION OF THE COUNTRY'S EXISTING COAL MINES AND ASSOCIATED INFRASTRUCTURE (22 NAIRA =1USD).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL COAL CORPORATION, GREY IWUH SAID IF REACTIVATED, NIGERIA'S EXISTING COAL MINES COULD EARN THE COUNTRY ABOUT 55 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS PER ANNUM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIGERIA CURRENTLY HAS 18 UNDEVELOPED COAL FIELDS, WITH COAL RESERVES OF 2.7 BILLION TONNES, HE SAID. SOME 10 OF THESE REQUIRE DETAILED EXPLORATION WORK, CONSTRUCTION OF ACCESS ROADS AND PRE-INVESTMENT STUDIES TO DETERMINE VIABILITY, AND A PROGRAMME OF DEVELOPMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE NIGERIAN MINING CORPORATION (MMC), WHICH OVERSEES THE COUNTRY'S VAST ARRAY OF SOLID MINERALS APART FROM URANIUM, COAL AND IRON ORE, HAS ALSO SUBMITTED ITS OWN PROPOSAL TO GOVERNMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MMC MANAGING DIRECTOR, YOHANAH BOT KWA, TOLD PANA &quot;THERE ARE DIVERSE MINERAL DEPOSITS IN NIGERIA (32 CURRENTLY) WITH VARIED INDUSTRIAL AND DOMESTIC USES AND THEIR EXPLOITATION CAN CONTRIBUTE TREMENDOUSLY TO NIGERIA'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE SAID WHAT IS NEEDED IS SUSTAINBLE INVESTMENT IN THE SECTOR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE SAID IT WAS TO STIMULATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINING SECTOR THAT THE NIGERIAN MINING CORPORATION WAS SET UP IN 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT KWA SAID &quot;IT IS PARADOXICAL THAT WHILE NIGERIA HAS BEEN SPENDING SUBSTANTIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO IMPORT VITAL MINERAL RAW MATERIALS, THEREBY ASSISTING OTHER COUNTRIES TO RESUSCITATE THEIR ECONOMIES, IT HAS SIMULTANEOUSLY FAILED TO GRASP AND EXPLOIT THE ABUNDANT OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY THE AVAILBILITY OF THESE RAW MATERIALS LOCALLY.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE SAID NIGERIA SPENDS ABOUT 800 MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE IMPORTATION OF RAW MATERIALS BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY OF LOCAL INDUSTRIES TO MEET DOMESTIC NEEDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AT THE SAME TIME, HE SAID, THE EXPORT POTENTIAL FOR NIGERIAN MINERALS, AS APPRAISED BY THE CORPORATION, IS MORE THAN 800 MILLION DOLLARS PER ANNUM WITH POTENTIAL INCREASE OF 25 PER CENT IN THE LONG TERM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEANWHILE, KWA SAID NIGERIA HAS SO FAR INVESTED MORE THAN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN ITS IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A GREATER PART OF THE AMOUNT, HE SAID, WAS SPENT ON IMPORTING INPUTS SUCH AS IRON ORES, COKING COAL, DOLOMITE, LIMESTONE, CLAYS, MAGNESITE, KYANITE, ZIRCON, GRAPHITE, MANGANESE SELICA SAND AND CHROMITE, ALL OF WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COUNTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT IS ESTIMATED BY INDUSTRIALISTS THAT IN ORDER TO FULLY HARNESS THE POTENTIALS OF NIGERIA'S SOLID MINERALS, ABOUT 350 MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE REQUIRED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS WOULD GO INTO EXPLORATION, APPRAISAL, DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLOITATION OF THE DEPOSITS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS ROADS, WATER AMD POWER SUPPLY TO MINING OPERATIONS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN THE SHORT TERM, THEY RECOMMEND THAT EMPHASIS BE PLACED ON INDUSTRIAL MINERALS TO SATISFY THE DOMESTIC MARKET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PROCEEDS FROM THE INDUSTRIAL MINERALS, THE INDUSTRIALISTS SAY, COULD BE USED TO SUSTAIN GROWTH AND PROVIDE EQUITY CAPITAL IN THE LONG TERM PROJECTS WITH EFFORTS GEARED TOWARDS DEVELOPING THE COMPLEX METALLIC MINERALS FOR JOINT CONCERNS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICIPATION IN THE MINING VENTURES, KWA SAID &quot;DUE TO THE RISK FACTOR&quot; AND THE LONG GESTATION PERIOD PRIVATE INVESTMENT HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ATTRACTED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE CALLED FOR SOME INCENTIVES SUCH AS LOWER TARIFFS AND INTEREST RATES AND ADEQUATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE ALLOCATION FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE NECESSARY MINING INPUTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO BE ALLOWED TO HOLD 100 PER CENT EQUITY IN MINING VENTURES WITH DRASTIC REDUCTION IN RENT AND FEES, HE ADDED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO USE SOLID MINERALS AS A LINCHPIN FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY, MANY INDUSTRIALISTS SAY NIGERIA MUST DO AWAY WITH &quot;NEGATIVE POLICIES THAT HINDER PRIVATE INVESTMENT&quot; IN THE SECTOR, SUCH AS HIGH RENTS AND FEES WHICH TEND TO ENCOURAGE ILLEGAL MINING.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> APRIL 11, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY FAITH ZABA,PANA CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, ZIMBABWE (PANA) - SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES, FACED WITH INCREASED COMPETITION FOR TOURISTS FROM DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, HAVE RESOLVED TO PROMOTE REGIONAL CO-OPERATION IN TOURISM, ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMIC SECTORS IN THE REGION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCOUNTING FOR LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF THE WORLD TOURISM EARNINGS, THE REGION COULD REALISE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF TOURISM OPERATORS ADOPT THE AGGRESSIVE BUSINESS ATTITUDES OF THEIR WESTERN COUNTERPARTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ACCORDING TO THE WORLD TOURISM ORGANISATION (WTO), PRELIMINARY RESULTS FOR 1994 INDICATE THAT TOURIST ARRIVALS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WERE 528 MILLION WITH TOTAL EARNINGS OF USD 40,125 BILLION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE REST OF THE WORLD ENJOYED A THREE PERCENT INCREASE IN ARRIVALS WHILE THE AFRICAN CONTINENT HAD A MODEST INCREASE OF 1.5 PERCENT.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION, AS A SINGLE TOURIST DESTINATION, HAS A POTENTIAL TO INCREASE INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS BY MORE THAN 10 PERCENT AFTER THE END OF APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA LAST YEAR, THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR IN MOZAMBIQUE AND IMPROVED PROSPECTS FOR PEACE IN ANGOLA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOTELIERS FROM SIX SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES MET IN ZIMBABWE RECENTLY TO DISCUSS STRATEGIES OF BOOSTING REGIONAL CO-OPERATION TO MAKE SOUTHERN AFRICA ONE OF THE PREMIER TOURIST DESTINATIONS ON THE CONTINENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOTELIERS FROM BOTSWANA, LESOTHO, MALAWI, NAMIBIA, ZAMBIA AND ZIMBABWE MET IN ZIMBABWE'S NORTHERN LAKE RESORT TOWN OF KARIBA WHERE THE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OF ZIMBABWE (HARAZ) WAS HOLDING ITS ANNUAL CONGRESS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE THEME OF THEIR CONGRESS -- BUILDING BRIDGES -- WAS FOCUSING MORE ON THE NEED FOR REGIONAL CO-OPERATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OTHER SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES STAND TO BENEFIT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT FROM THE NEWLY INDEPENDENT SOUTH AFRICA, WHICH ENJOYED A 12 PERCENT INCREASE OF TOURIST ARRIVALS LAST YEAR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AS A RESULT OF THE ADVENT OF PEACE IN THAT COUNTRY, TOURISTS FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM, GERMANY, THE UNITED STATES, FRANCE AND THE FAR EAST ARE NOW FOCUSING ON SOUTH AFRICA AS A TOURIST DESTINATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN SOUTH AFRICA, THE TOURISM INDUSTRY EARNED MORE THAN 12 BILLION RANDS (3.34 BILLION US DOLLARS) WHILE ZIMBABWE, WITH THE NEXT LARGEST INDUSTRY, EARNED 800 ZIMDOLLARS MILLION (USD 100 MILLION).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH AFRICAN TOURISM BOARD CHIEF EXECUTIVE MAVUSO MSIMANG SAID THERE WAS NEED FOR JOINT MARKETING TO ATTRACT MORE INTERNATIONAL VISITORS TO THE REGION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THERE IS AMPLE SPACE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOURISM IN OUR REGION AND WE MUST JOIN HANDS AND GET ON WITH THE JOB. TOURISM IS ABOUT BUILDING BRIDGES. LET US USE TOURISM AND OUR UNIQUE AFRICAN HOSPITALITY TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL,&quot; HE SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMBABWE'S MINISTER OF ENVIRONMENT AND TOURISM, HERBERT MURERWA, SAID SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRIES SHOULD ADOPT THE CONCEPT OF MULTI-DESTINATION TOURISM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WE MUST WORK TOGETHER AND SHARE OUR LIMITED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM IMPACT IN THE SOURCE MARKET,'' MURERWA SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN REGION COULD MORE THAN DOUBLE ITS ANNUAL EARNINGS IF ITS GOVERNMENTS IMMEDIATELY SCRAPPED VISAS FOR ITS REGIONAL NATIONALS AND RESIDENTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMBABWE IS SAID TO BE LOSING MORE THAN 100 MILLION ZIMDOLLARS (USD 12.5 MILLION) IN POTENTIAL TOURISTS FROM SOUTH AFRICA WHO ARE REQUIRED TO PAY 90 RAND (25 US DOLLARS) FOR A SINGLE ENTRY. ZIMBABWEANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, GET FREE VISAS TO ENTER SOUTH AFRICA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE RECENTLY CREATED SOUTHERN AFRICA HOSPITALITY ASSOCIATION (SAHA) HAS CALLED ON SOUTHERN AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO ABOLISH VISA CHARGES FOR PEOPLE TRAVELLING IN THE REGION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CURRENT MEMBERS OF SAHA INCLUDE BOTSWANA, MOZAMBIQUE, NAMIBIA, SOUTH AFRICA, ZAMBIA AND ZIMBABWE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAHA CHAIRMAN ENZIO ROSSI OF ZAMBIA SAID SOUTHERN AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS SHOULD INTRODUCE A SOUTHERN AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) VISA FOR INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS TO FACILITATE INTERNATIONAL TOURISTS' FREE MOVEMENT WITHIN THE REGION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ROSSI ALSO URGED GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGION TO INTRODUCE A SADC PASSPORT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT THE REGION SHOULD BE MARKETED AS A SINGLE TOURIST DESTINATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SELLING REGIONAL PACKAGES COMBINING THE MAJOR TOURIST ATTRACTIONS IN THE REGION,&quot; HE SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE MAJOR CONCERN WHICH AROSE AT THE CONGRESS WAS THE NEED FOR INCREASED PARTICIPATION OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE TOURISM INDUSTRY IN THE REGION IS DOMINATED BY THOSE OF WHITE STOCK -- THIS WAS EVIDENT AT THE CONGRESS WHERE THE RATIO WAS ONE BLACK TO THREE WHITE PARTICIPANTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOST INDIGENOUS PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY ARE EMPLOYEES RATHER THAN ENTREPRENEURS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THERE ARE 319 TOUR OPERATORS IN ZIMBABWE, OF WHICH ONLY 19 ARE BLACK ENTREPRENEURS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OF THE 19, FIVE PULLED OUT AFTER EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS, 10 ARE RUNNING MINIBUSES, TWO SAFARI AND CANOEING OPERATIONS AND ONE HAS EMPLOYED AGENTS TO RUN HIS OPERATIONS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMBABWE'S TOURISM MINISTER, MURERWA, SAID HOTELIERS SHOULD ENTER INTO JOINT VENTURES WITH INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE SAME ISSUE, HOTEL AND RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION OF ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT PAUL MATAMISA REASSURED WHITES THAT EFFORTS BY GOVERNMENT TO INDIGENISE THE ECONOMY WERE NOT A THREAT BUT WOULD MAKE MORE PEOPLE ECONOMICALLY STRONGER.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THAT INDIGENISATION IS NOT A THREAT TO ANY ONE SECTION OF OUR POPULATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;APPLIED FAIRLY AND CORRECTLY, IT WILL BENEFIT US ALL, MAKING MANY MORE PEOPLE ECONOMICALLY STRONGER AND HELPING REDUCE SUCH NEGATIVES AS UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY,&quot; HE SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MATAMISA SAID GOVERNMENT HAD A MAJOR ROLE TO PLAY IN ASSISTING BLACK ENTREPRENEURS INTO THE INDUSTRY BY PROVIDING START-UP CAPITAL AND CREATING AN ENABLING ENVIRONMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT IS ONE THING TO TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR REGIONAL COOPERATION - THE CHALLENGE IS NOW FOR THE REGION TO DEVELOP SOLID FRAMEWORKS FOR EFFECTIVE CO-OPERATION AND CO-ORDINATION OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EGYPT HAS ACCEPTED A PROPOSAL BY THE UNITED NATIONS CULTURAL AGENCY, UNESCO, TO ALTER THE ROUTE OF THE EIGHT-LANE CAIRO RINGROAD WHICH WAS CUT ACROSS THE ANCIENT PYRAMIDS LYING SOUTH OF THE CITY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE GOVERNMENT AND THE UN EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANISATION AGREED ON AN ALTERNATE ROUTE RUNNINHG FROM THE NORTH OF THE SITE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WORLD FAMOUS PYRAMIDS HAVE BEEN DECLARED A 'WORLD HERITAGE' SITE BY UNESCO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNESCO AND EGYPTIAN OFFICIALS MET LAST WEEK TO WORK OUT DETAILS OF THE NEW ROUTE. THE OFFICIALS ALSO HAD TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT WAS IN CONFORMITY WITH EGYPTIAN LAWS PASSED IN 1983, WHICH PROTECT THE AREA CLOSE TO THE GISEH PYRAMIDS SOME 4,500 YEARS OLD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DURING ITS FIVE-DAY VISIT, THE MISSION HAD TALKS WITH A COMMITTEE OF EXPERTS FROM THE MINISTRIES OF CULTURE, DEFENCE, LOCAL ADMINISTRATION, RECONSTRUCTION AND NEW COMMUNITIES, AS WELL AS WITH THE GISEH GOVERNNOR'S OFFICE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT WAS FEARED THE FOUR-KILOMETRE FREEWAY WOULD BRING A F GROWTH OF AUTO EXHAUT GASES AND UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF VIBRATION THAT WOULD DESTROY THE POLLUTION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PYRAMIDS AND THE GISEH SPHINXES HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED DAMAGE FROM UNPLANNED BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AROUND THE ARES, WASTE DISPOSAL AND TRAFFIC.  THEY SUFFER FROM AIR AND CLIMATIC EROSION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A SECTION OF THE ROAD, WHICH PASSES CLOSE TO THE PYRAMIDS, MIGHT BE DESTROYED THIS WEEK THE SECRETARY GENRAL OF THE EGYPTIAN SUPREME COUNCIL OF ANTIQUITIES, ABDEL HALIM NOUREDDIN, SAID.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BY MUSENGWA KAYAYA, PAN AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) CORRESPONDENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A NEW STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS ON THE ATMOSPHERE HAS REFUTED COMPUTER PREDICTIONS OF DANGEROUS WARMING OF GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AS EXAGGERATED AND SHOULD BE REJECTED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE IS THAT THE COMPUTER MODELS ARE NOT ABLE TO PREDICT CHANGES IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE BASED ON CARBON-DIOXIDE LEVELS,&quot; SAID SALLIE BALIUNUS, A HAVARD ASTROPHYSICIST AND SENIOR SCIENTIST AT THE MARSHALL INSTITUTE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE STUDY WAS RELEASED 3 APRIL BY THE GEORGE C.MARSHALL INSTITUTE IN THE UNITED STATES.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WEDNESDAY'S ISSUE OF THE WASHINGTON LINE,&quot; A UNITED STATES' STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLICATION, QUOTED THE STUDY AS SAYING THAT SCIENTIFIC FACTS FAIL TO SUPPORT POLICYMAKERS CALLING FOR IMMEDIATE LIMITS ON CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS FROM THE BURNING OF COAL AND OIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE REPORT WAS RELEASED TO COINCIDE WITH THE UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE TREATY CONFERENCE IN THE FUTURE GERMANY CAPITAL, BERLIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BALIUNUS IS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT POLICY-MAKERS NEED ACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT MAN-MADE CARBON DIOXIDE AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GLOBAL WARMING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCIENTISTS HAVE PREDICTED THAT CURRENT RATES OF FOSSIL FUEL USE COULD RESULT IN DOUBLING OF ATMOSPHERIC CARBON BY LATE IN THE NEXT CENTURY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COMPUTER SIMULATIONS ON EARTH CLIMATE SHOW SUCH DOUBLING WOULD CAUSE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE TO RISE BY AS MUCH AS THREE DEGREES CENTIGRADE, LEADING IN INCREASE IN COASTAL FLOODING, TROPICAL CYCLONES AND DROUGHT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOWEVER, THE MARSHALL STUDY SAYS THAT TEMPERATURE CHANGES OBSERVED OVER THE LAST 50 TO 100 YEARS, IN RESPONSE TO INCREASE IN CARBON-DIOXIDE, SUGGEST THAT TEMPERATURE INCREASES FROM A DOUBLING OF GREENHOUSE GASES WILL BE LESS THAN ONE DEGREE CENTIGRADE AND INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM NATURAL CLIMATE FLUCTUATIONS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE PREDICTED WARMING IS EXAGGERATED BY A LARGE FACTOR. ACCORDING TO THE SCCENTIFIC EVIDENCE, THE WARMING SHOULD BE WELL UNDER ONE DEGREE CENTIGRADE. THIS RISE, SPREAD OVER A CENTURY, WOULD LIKELY BE BEGIGN,&quot; BALIUNUS SAID IN HER STUDY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE UNITED NATIONS HAS DECLARED A WORLD SOLAR ENERGY DECADE FROM 1996 TO 2005. THIS IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF SOLAR ENERGY GLOBALLY, MORE SUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY SOURCE OF POWER COMPARED TO COAL AND OIL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THESE FOSSIL FUELS ARE BLAMED FOR POLLUTING THE EARTH AND THREATENING MAN'S EXISTENCE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COAL COMBUSTION HAS BEEN PROVED BY SCIENCE TO PRODUCE ACID RAIN WHICH RESULTS IN THE POLLUTION OF LAKES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WORLD BODY HAS FORMED A WORLD SOLAR COMMISSION CHAIRED BY ZIMBABWEAN PRSSIDENT ROBERT MUGABE TO OVERSEE THE GLOBAL TRANSITION TO MORE USE OF THE SUN A SOURCE OF ENERGY FOR THE FUTURE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT IS ...VITAL THAT VITUALLY FREE PRIMARY ENERGY RESOURCES ARE FOUND AND EXPLOITED AND THE MOST PROMISING OF THESE IS SOLAR ENERY,&quot; BORIS BERKOVISKI SAID RECENTLY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BERKOVISKI, THE DIRECTOR OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY DIVISION OF UNESCO, WAS SPEAKING AT AN AFRICAN REGIONAL CONFERENCE OF ENERGY EXPERTS MEETING IN THE ZIMBABWEAN CAPITAL, HARARE TO MAP OUT THE REGION'S UNPUT TO THE WORLD SOLAR DECADE.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAND AND WATER MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES ARE THE ONLY VIABLE WAY OF ENSURING SUCCESS FOR SMALL-SCALE FARMERS IN THE SEMI-ARID PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, AGRICULTURAL EXPERTS ENDING A WORKSHOP ON SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION HAVE AGREED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EXPERTS RULED OUT IRRIGATION BECAUSE IT WAS COSTLY. THE OFTEN CASH-STRAPPED FARMERS HAVE TO RELY ON LIMITED, ERRATIC RAINFALL.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THEY SAID THAT DIFFERENT TILLAGE TECHNIQUES HAD PROVED HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON SOIL AND SITE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF HIGH VARIABILITY OF CONDITIONS, DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS SHOULD BE PROMOTED AS OPTIONS RATHER THAN BLANKET RECOMMENDATIONS,&quot; THEY SAID,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FARMERS, THEY ADDED, SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO SELECT, TEST AND EXPERIMENT WITH OPTIONS &quot;IN ORDER TO ADAPT TECHNOLOGIES TO THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND CONDITIONS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SPECIALISTS AGREED THAT HIGH WATER LOSSES FROM ARABLE LAND THROUGH SURFACE RUN-OFF AND RAMPANT SOIL LOSS THROUGH SHEET EROSION DIMINISHED THE LOW AGRICULTURAL POTENTIAL OF THESE AREAS, CHARACTERISED BY GENERALLY SANDY AND INFERTILE SOILS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRAINING OF FARMERS SHOULD BE BASED ON TEACHING OF PROCESSES AND SHARING OF AVAILABLE FARMER KNOWLEDGE RATHER THAN TEACHING OF TECHNIQUES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE FIVE-DAY WORKSHOP WAS CONVENED IN THE WAKE OF RAMPANT LAND DEGRADATION THAT HAS SEEN YIELDS PLUMMET AND FARMER MORALE SINK IN ZIMBABWE'S SEMI-ARID NATURAL REGIONS FOUR AND FIVE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MAJORITY OF COMMUNAL FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE LIVE AND FARM IN THESE REGIONS WITH AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL OF 600 MILLIMETRES OR LESS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALTHOUGH THE ANNUAL RAINFALL IS LOW, THE INTENSITY OF THE RAINFALL OFTEN EXCEEDS THE INFILTRATION RATE OF THE SOIL. THEREFORE, MUCH RUN-OFF OCCURS EXPOSING THE SOIL TO VARIOUS FORMS OF EROSION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WORKSHOP WAS SPONSORED BY THE GERMAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ZIMBABWE. IT DREW AT LEAST 60 PARTICIPANTS FROM THE FARMING COMMUNITY, RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMBABWE VICE-PRESIDENT JOSHUA NKOMO HAS UNVEILED A MULTI-BILLION PROGRAMME TO GIVE A FACE LIFT TO CITIES OF HARARE AND BULAWAYO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE SAID GOVERNMENT WOULD BEGIN BUILDING SATELLITE TOWNS THIS YEAR IN THE URBAN CENTRES WITH IMPROVED HOUSING DESIGNS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES INDUSTRIAL CENTRES THAT WOULD FURTHER BLACK ADVANCEMENT INTO THE MAINSTREAM OF THE WHITE DOMINATED ECONOMY.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALTHOUGH THE LAND FOR THE PROJECTS HAD ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED IN BOTH CITIES, WHICH TOGETHER HAVE AN ESTIMATED 1.14 MILLION PEOPLE, MUNICIPALITIES HAD NOT BEEN APPROACHED. HOWEVER, THEY WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TAKE PART.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PROGRAMME WILL EMPHASISE PRODUCTION OF MODERN STRUCTURES THAT WILL REMAIN ACCEPTABLE OVER MANY YEARS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WHAT THE BULAWAYO CITY COUNCIL DID IN NKETA AND NKULUMANE IS A TRAGEDY THAT WE WILL AVOID IN THE NEW TOWN,&quot; NKOMO SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE SATELLITE TOWN WILL STRETCH FROM MAKOKOBA, BULAWAYO'S OLDEST TOWNSHIP, WHICH WILL BE DEMOLISHED AND REBUILT, TO GREENSPAN THAT IS AT THE MOMENT AN EXPANSE OF MAIZE FIELDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNLIKE PRESENT HOUSING SCHEMES THAT WERE DIVORCED FROM EMPLOYMENT CREATION, THE NEW TOWNS WILL BE PLANNED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT DWELLERS WILL BE GET WORK AND AFFORD RENTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PRESENT SCHEMES, NKOMO SAID, SOON BECAME A FARCE AFTER STANDS AND HOUSES WERE REPOSSESSED WHEN PEOPLE FAILED TO SERVICE THE MORTGAGES, LEAVING THEM HOMELESS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMBABWE NEEDS 84,000 NEW HOUSES EVERY YEAR TO MEET URBAN DEMAND OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS, WHILE OVER 33 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IS UNEMPLOYED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NKOMO SAID THE EXISTING TOWNS WERE DOMINATED BY NON-AFRICANS WHOM THE GOVERNMENT DID NOT WANT TO PUSH OUT BUT WAS CREATING COMPETITION FOR THEM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PROGRAMME, HE SAID, WAS A STATE PROJECT THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEVELOPMENT TRUST OF ZIMBABWE WHICH HE CHAIRS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DAKAR, SENEGAL (PANA) - WHILE THERE MAY BE NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT THE SPATE OF ETHNIC KILLINGS IN BURUNDI, A NEW WEEKLY NEWAPAPER THERE USED A CARTOON TO ILLUSTRATE THE GRAVITY OF THIS PROBLEM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN ITS FIRST ISSUE BUJUMBURA'S PRO-TUTSI 'L'OBSERVATEUR' ILLUSTRATED THE SOMEWHAT UNEASY COHABITATION BETWEEN HUTU HEAD OF STATE SYLVESTRE NTIBANTUNGANYA AND HIS TUTSI PRIME MINISTER, ANTOINE NDUWAYO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNDER THE TITLE &quot;TWO BULLS IN THE ARENA&quot; THE 12-PAGE TABLOID SHOWED BOTH MEN IN SHORTS, BOXING GLOVES ON AND READY TO DRAW BLOOD. NTIBANTUNGANYA WAS SHOWN CLUTCHING A HAND GRENADE BEHIND HIS BACK PRIMED AND READY TO BE HURLED AT NDUWAYO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THEN, SHOWING THEIR VASTLY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON POLICY, IT HAD NDUWAYO SAYING, &quot;I SHOULD HUNT AND DESTROY ALL ARMED HUTU BANDITS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NTIBANTUNGANYA REPLIES, &quot;I SHOULD OVERHAUL THE TUTSI DOMINATED ARMY.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ARMY WAS SUBJECT FOR MORE ANALYSIS IN THE PAPER'S INSIDE PAGES.  WHILE EXPLAINING TUTSI PRE-EMINENCE IN THE ARMY, L'OBSERVATEUR SAID IT WAS UNTRUE THAT IT WAS ENTIRELY SO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE HEAVY TUTSI PRESENCE IN THE ARMY OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, IT CLAIMED, WAS BECAUSE THEY SOUGHT PROTECTION FORM EXTERMINATION BY THE HUTU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THIS PREDOMINANCE OF TUTSI IN THE ARMY, THEREFORE, PROVOKED FEAR AMONG THE HUTU,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THESE FEARS WERE UNJUSTIFIED, IT SAID, ESPECIALLY SINCE HUTUS HAVE TAKEN TEST THIS YEAR FOR ENTRY INTO DIFFERENT RANKS OF THE ARMY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CONCLUDING, IT CLAIMED &quot;THE TUTSI DOMINATION IN DIFFERENT ARMY UNITS IS SIMPLY DUE TO THE HUTU'S OWN WISH TO STAY OUT.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN ANOTHER TROUBLESOME COUNTRY, NIGER, PAPERS COMMENTED ON THE NEGOTIATIONS IN BURKINA FASO BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND TUAREGS REBELS. SOME HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP OF THE UNITED TUAREG FRONT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE WEEKLY 'LE REPUBLICAN' OF NIAMEY NOTED THAT THE REPLACEMENT OF MANO DAYAK BY RHISSA BOULA AS HEAD OF THE TUAREG RESISTANCE HAD NOT STOPPED THE PEACE TALKS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANOTHER NIAMEY WEEKLY 'LE DEMOCRATE' EXPLAINED THE LEADERSHIP CHANGE THIS WAY: AS AN AGREEMENT DRAWS INEVITABLY NEARER BOULA, A MAN OF THE PEOPLE, WISHES &quot;TO SHARE SOME OF THE FRUITS&quot; OF PEACE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT SAID THAT BOULA MAY WELL DESERVE TO GAIN SOMETHING OUT OF PEACE SINCE HE HAS SACRIFICED MORE THAN DAYAK, WHO PASSES HIS TIME PLAYING THE STAR ON EUROPEAN TELEVISION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT IS RIGHT TO REPLACE THE HEAD OF THE ORGANISATION OF THE ARMED RESISTANCE,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BECAUSE OF HIS POPULARITY AMONG THE PEOPLE, IT SAID, HE IS THE BEST MAN TO ASK FOR AN INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO THE MASSACRES OF TCHINTEBARADEN, THE RELEASE OF TUAREG PRISONERS, DEVELOPMENT FOR TUAREG AREAS AND THE DISARMING OF THE ARAB MILITIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FOR ITS PART, TOGOLESE NEWSPAPERS COMMENTED ON BENIN'S LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS WHICH WERE FREE OF ARGUMENT AND VIOLENCE. ONE PAPER NOTED THAT THERE WERE NO SOLDIERS AROUND AND ORDER WAS MAINTAINED BY VILLAGE CHIEFS THROUGHOUT POLLING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PAPER, THE WEEKLY 'MOTION D'INFORMATION', TERMED BENIN'S EXPERIENCE &quot;A LESSON IN DEMOCRACY AND GOOD CITIZENSHIP&quot; FOR TOGO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IT WAS ADMIRABLE. IT (EXEMPLIFIED) THE DETERMINATION OF VOTERS FOR CLEAN ELECTIONS,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IN TOGO, OUR LEADERS HAVE NOT YET ATTAINED THIS LEVEL OF MATURITY,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN TOGO, IT WENT ON, EVEN TASKS AS SIMPLE AS UPDATING ELECTORAL LISTS TURNS INTO VIOLENCE WHICH EVENTUALLY BRING POLICE, SOLDIERS, GERNDARMES AND EVEN ARMY VETERANS INTO TAKING PART IN ELECTORAL FRAUD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE VANGUARD OF LAGOS COMMENTED ON WHAT IT CALLED NIGERIA'S LIBERIAN ADVENTURE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT WONDERED IF THE COUNTRY COULD SUSTAIN THE 660,000 NAIRA (30,000 U.S. DOLLARS) DAILY TO FEED ABOUT 6,000 TROOPS IN LIBERIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WHEN OTHER COSTS SUCH AS MILITARY HARDWARE, TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNICATIONS AND SUNDRY EXPENSES ARE CALCULATED FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS DURING WHICH NIGERIA HAS BEEN PART OF ECOMOG, THE COST MUST BE MIND-BOGGLING,&quot; HE SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT NOTED THAT TANZANIA AND UGANDA WERE PULLING OUT OF THE OPERATION BECAUSE &quot;THE INTRASINGENCE OF THE LIBERIAN WARLORDS CAN NO LONGER BE TOLERATED.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OPTIONS OPEN TO NIGERIA, IT SAID, INCLUDED AN ULTIMATUM TO THE WARLORDS THAT THE PRESENT PEACE PROCESS &quot;WILL BE THE LAST OPPORTUNITY OR WE PULL OUT.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT CONCLUDED: &quot;WE HAVE TO BE COST-CONSCIOUS AS OUR RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. THIS THE LIBERIANS MUST BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CUTTING COSTS AND AMASSING WEALTH WERE ALSO THE PREOCCUPATION OF DAKAR'S 'LE SOLEIL' WHEN COMMENTING ON SENEGAL'S 35TH INDEPENDENCE ANNIVERSARY OF THE COUNTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;GENERATING WEALTH SHOULD BECOME OUR LEITMOTIF, OUR PERSONAL AND COLLECTIVE OBSESSION, OUR STRONG YEARNING,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IN THIS RESPECT THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IS TO BEGIN,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TURNING TO JIMMY CARTER'S BATTLE AGAINST THE GUINEA-WORMS, THE VANGUARD NOTED THAT THE INFECTION DROPPED FROM 700,000 TO 36,000 CASES IN ONE YEAR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS RESULT BY CARTER'S GLOBAL 2000, IT SAID, WAS &quot;A MONUMENTAL ACHIEVEMENT.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT SAID, &quot;WE COMMEND THE DRIVE, DEDICATED AND COMMITMENT WHICH FORMER PRESIDENT CARTER HAS BROUGHT INTO THE PROJECT.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOVERNMENTS AT VARIOUS LEVELS IN NIGERIA MUST, IT SAID, SUPPORT &quot;THIS WORTHY PROJECT&quot; BY PROVIDING SAFE AND POTABLE DRINKING WATER FOR THE PEOPLE.  HEALTH OFFICIALS AT LOCAL LEVELS &quot;MUST ALSO INTENSIFY CAMPAIGNS&quot; TO PREVENT THE DISEASE FROM SPREADING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THIS IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO TO SHOW THAT EFFORTS BY MR. CARTER AND HIS ORGANISATION WILL NOT BE IN VAIN,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November-December, 1994</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by N. Sema Hurugo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A health insurance society has been in existence in Zaire since 1986.  It was started by the Bwamanda Centre for Integrated Development to counter the difficulties which the district's rural population faced in having no fixed income to pay for hospital care, and also to compensate for reduced eternal financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Membership of the Mutual Society, a true health insurance scheme, is not obligatory. So people have to be made aware of its value and convinced that sickness is a risk inherent in life which they must make provision for so that, when it does occur, they are prepared against the unforeseeable aspects - its gravity, duration, overall cost and economic consequences, and the professional and moral impact.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The registering of new members took place in March each year, the period when both the Center for Integrated Development and the traders are engaged in buying agricultural produce. The peasants therefore have some income and can afford the annual premium. This premium takes account of local purchasing power and is fixed empirically at a sum equivalent to the price of two to three kilograms of soya per year and per individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When an individual signs up with the Society, he or she is also obliged to sign up all the family members, each paying an individual premium.  So members are in family units and today include 60% of the population of Bwamanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The health centres maintain files on each family and it is they who refer the sick to hospital, with a transfer coupon affirming that they are Mutual Society member. The Society covers all their hospital and some primary care dispensed at the health centres, particularly for tuberculosis, heart diseases, leprosy and childbirth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The success of Bwamanda's Mutual Society is due principally to three factors: participation of the community and the agencies of the medical service and of rural development in all stages of the process, from conception to organization; the trust existing between the community and the medical service, thanks especially to the quality of health care offered and to such other activities of the Centre for Integrated Development at a farming, digging of wells and rural promotion drives; the investment of the funds collected in the purchase of drugs. The existence of a well run regional pharmacy helps to ensure that the contributions collected are well spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fully accepted and understood by the people of Bwamanda, the Society has already shown good results. It gives people greater access to health care by covering 80% of all outpatient and hospital treatment. It has much improved the finances of the general referral hospital by ensuring that t 70% of the costs are recouped, a remarkable feat considering the social and economic crisis at present facing Zaire. Finally by encouraging those who are well to pay for those who are sick, it represents a real attempt to promote community solidarity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sudan Democratic Gazette (London)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the Khartoum regime's refusal to work with the United Nations Human Rights Commission's Special Rapporteur, Gaspar Biro, throughout the whole of 1994, the commission still found growing evidence of human rights abuses in Sudan and so voted on 8 March to condemn this record and to renew Mr. Biro's mandate for another year. Thirty-three countries out of a total of fifty-three voted to condemn Sudan. Only seven countries voted against, ten abstained and three absented themselves from the vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more so than in previous years, the Khartoum regime finds itself isolated internationally. Those countries who voted against the resolution were notable for their own poor records on human rights; namely China, Cuba, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The seventh vote was cast by the Khartoum regime itself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More African Condemnation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although it was disappointing that only Mauritius out of all the African countries present joined with the twenty-one European countries, Japan and the USA, to sponsor the resolution, the actual voting record of African countries on the resolution itself was an improvement on last year.  Of the fifteen African members of the commission apart from Sudan, seven voted to condemn Sudan. These were: Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Malawi, Mauritius and Zimbabwe. Five countries abstained. These were Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia and Togo. Of these, only Ethiopia's position as one of the mediators in the IGADD process had real justification for an abstention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Egypt acted more responsibly this year than last by abstaining rather than absenting themselves. Egypt's position has always been a difficult one due to its close ties with Sudan. The Khartoum regime regularly tries to blackmail the Cairo administration into supporting its position by trying to bring Egypt's own dubious human rights record before the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Egypt, Mauritania has its own reasons for abstaining. The country has been exposed as one of the few states where slavery is still practiced, and so it would have found it difficult to support a resolution which criticises the re-emergence of slavery in Sudan. The abstentions of Cote d'Ivoire, Angola and Togo are less easy to explain. Togo is one of the emerging democracies in Africa and its failure to support human rights issues at the UN casts doubt on its ongoing democratic experiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In presenting his report to the commission, Dr. Biro regretted that the Khartoum regime had failed to co-operate with him during 1994. He observed that he was nonetheless able to collect information and data on human rights abuses during field visits to Sudan's neighbours, Egypt, Uganda and Kenya, as well as through talking to Sudanese, UN and international humanitarian agencies. He observed that the human rights situation in Sudan has not improved during 1994. In some areas, it has deteriorated. He gave as an example of this deterioration the regime's aerial bombardment of civilian targets inside Southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The special rapporteur emphasised the plight of the most vulnerable groups: children, women and the elderly. He wrote: &quot;In this introductory statement I want very much to emphasise the sad situation of the most defenceless victims of all sorts of abuses and violations throughout the whole country: the women and the children. Particularly in the North, displaced women and children are affected by the most atrocious practices by government agents. Nubians are perhaps the most prominent within this category of victims: reports on abduction of children fro the Nuba Mountains continued to arrive during the past year. Cruelty, ruthlessness and arbitrariness are the most important characteristics of these actions. On 15 October 1994, for instance, scores of settlers in Omdurman, protesting a new campaign of destruction of houses by bulldozers and the forced resettlement of squatters by the authorities, were disbursed by force by the Sudanese security forces. These forces shot indiscriminately into the unarmed crowd, which included women and children, leaving 5 squatters and seriously injuring more than 25 others. In the South, according to 1994 UNICEF estimates, around 500,000 minors are in danger because of the war. Any shortages due to forced suspension of humanitarian assistance have direct repercussions on women and children firstly. On 8 January 1995 for instance, UN and NGO staff were relocated from Maiwut following the Government's withdrawal of the location from the Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) flight clearance list for the month of January. OLS considered that because of this situation approximately 10,900 residents and displaced persons were placed at risk, including over 1,000 unaccompanied minors who were receiving assistance from among others UNICEF and WFP. It is worth mentioning while the number of people in need of emergency food aid in Sudan has dropped from 4.3 million in 1994 to 1.2 million, of which some 720,000 are in Southern Sudan, OLS estimated at the end of January 1995 that an intensification of the fighting in Equatoria, Bahr al Ghazal and Upper Nile provinces may force thousands of people to abandon their harvest and run for safety.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Comprehensive Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year's resolution condemning human rights abuse in Sudan was more comprehensive than in previous years. The resolution included terms on slavery and support for the IGADD regional peace process amongst its main points. The document:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations in the Sudan, including summary executions, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions without due process, violations of the rights of women and children, slavery and slavery -like practices, forced displacement of persons and systematic torture;...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Urges the Government of the Sudan fully to respect human rights, and calls upon all parties to cooperated in order to ensure such respect;...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to cease immediately the deliberate and indiscriminate aerial bombardment of civilian targets;...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan, particularly summary executions, detentions without trial, forced displacement of persons and torture, as described in, &quot;inter alia&quot;, recent reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance, ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Deplores the fact that, following its interference with the Special Rapporteur's visit in 1993, the Government of the Sudan has persisted in its refusal to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur in his efforts to carry out his mandate in full, in particular by denying him the right to visit the Sudan;...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Urges the Government of the Sudan to release all political detainees and prisoner, cease all acts of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and close down all clandestine or unacknowledged detention centres, and to ensure that all accused persons are held in the custody of ordinary police or prison authorities where family members and lawyers can visit them and that such persons receive just and fair trials under internationally recognised standards;...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Per haps the two new and most striking features of the commission's resolution on Sudan are the clear statement on slavery and the endorsement of the IGADD peace initiative. On slavery, the resolution:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Urges the Government of the Sudan to terminate policies or activities which support, condone, encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children, the separation of children from their families and social backgrounds, or which subject children to forced internment, indoctrination or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Calls upon the government of the Sudan to work actively for the eradication of practices which are directed against and particularly violate the human rights of women and girls, and welcomes activities by any local or women's groups towards that end, as reported by the Special Rapporteur;...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the IGADD initiative the commission:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Notes with appreciation the current regional effort of the heads of State of the Intergovernmental Authority on Draught and Development (Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda) to assist parties to the conflict in the Sudan to reach a peaceful settlement;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Urges all parties to the conflict to agree to an immediate cease-fire and to co-operate fully with the present regional initiative of the heads of State of the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Honourable Ministers; Premier of the Gauteng Province; Councillors of Pretoria and Johannesburg; Friends from abroad and the diplomatic corps; Distinguished Guests;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow South Africans;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As dawn ushered in this day, the 27th of April, 1995, few of us could suppress the welling of emotion, as we were reminded of the terrible past from which we come as a nation; the great possibilities that we now have; and the bright future that beckons us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so we assemble here today, and in other parts of the country, to mark a historic day in the life of our nation. Wherever South Africans are across the globe, our hearts beat as one, as we renew our common loyalty to our country and our commitment to its future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The birth of our South African nation has, like any other, passed through a long and often painful process. The ultimate goal of a better life has yet to be realised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if any one day marked the crossing of the divide from a past of conflict and division to the possibility of unity and peace; from inequality to equality; from a history of oppression to a future of freedom, it is 27 April 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On this day, you, the people, took your destiny into your own hands.  You decided that nothing would prevent you from exercising your hard-won right to elect a government of your choice. Your patience, your discipline, your single-minded purposefulness have become a legend throughout the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You won this respect because you made the simple but profound statement that the time had come for the people to govern. You turned our diversity from a weakness to be exploited for selfish ends; into a richness to be celebrated for the good of all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, we meet to reaffirm that we are one people with one destiny; a destiny that we can now shape together from the sweat of our brows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear compatriots;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have learnt over the First Freedom Year that there is no short-cut to making South Africa the country of our dreams. It requires hard work by those entrusted with positions of responsibility in government. It demands that workers and employers work together to produce efficiently and compete with the best in the world, to achieve equity and to help create more jobs.  It requires hard work on the part of farmers and farm-workers, to feed the nation and provide raw materials, even in the face of adversity. It requires hard work by students and teachers to build a literate, skilled and learned nation. It requires greater exertion by our sports-persons and artists to always offer the best for the country and its people. It demands of all of us, wherever we may be, to exercise our rights as citizens; and do so without infringing on the rights of others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa is firmly set on the road to peace and prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the spirit of Masakhane, w must, as a nation, strive to do better, and even better, all the time. This is the challenge that we face, as we enter the Second Freedom Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rights that we now enjoy should be improved as we draft the new constitution. And you, and only you, can ensure that the Constitutional Assembly produces what is best for the country. We must ensure that democracy reaches our localities, at work and everywhere we interact. To make the RDP work, we must all register for the November Local Government elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On its part, Government is finalising guidelines for next year's budget: to ensure greater spending on education, health, housing and other needs. We are determined that public funds must be spent responsibly and in an open fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The projects we have started in Odi-Moretele, Weenen, Ibhayi, the East Rand, Kutama-Sinthumule, Mogopa and other areas have shown that the people, working together with government, can improve their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The phasing in of free education; free medical care to children under six and pregnant mothers; the school nutrition scheme; land restitution - all these and others are the beginnings of programmes to give freedom real meaning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Second Freedom year, we must speed up these programmes; cut down on bureaucratic red tape; ensure that there are community structures to manage them; and direct more relief to the Fellow South Africans; 27 April bequeathed us the supreme bodies to make laws and guard our democratic rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we move into the Second Freedom Year, our democracy will be strengthened by the welcome role of bodies such as the Constitutional Court, Human Rights Commission and the soon-to-be-established Truth and Reconciliation Commission, not only to correct past wrongs, but also to create a better future. In the same vein, we shall need more systematic work in parliament to complete the legal framework needed for transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But freedom would be meaningless without security in the home and in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is for this reason that government has set in motion a plan to deal firmly with crime and violence. Discussions have been completed to allocate more resources for the training of police officers, improving facilities in areas ignored under apartheid, and to facilitate the setting up of more Police Community Forums. These funds will be acquired both from the shifting of priorities in the ministry concerned, and from the RDP Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the spirit of Masakhane, where communities succeed in co-operating with the police to bring down the levels of crime, and where they ensure that services are paid for, serious consideration will be given to increase the investment of public funds in these localities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We thank the security forces, whose support for the process of change has been invaluable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the spirit of goodwill that accompanies this, our first Freedom Day, I have decided to grant amnesty to the following categories of prisoners: Firstly, a special remission of sentences of one quarter for all prisoners with a maximum remission of six months. This amnesty will not apply to prisoners sentenced for child abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, a remission of sentences on all persons who were charged solely for the possession, before 6 December 1993, of arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices, associated with political conflicts of the past, irrespective of their political affiliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These measures will come into effect as soon as the Departments concerned have completed the necessary administrative procedures. We hope that through this act of goodwill, we are sending message to all prisoners that they should mend their ways and make a fresh start. We appeal to society to help them resettle in communities as responsible and law-abiding citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fellow compatriots; Over the past year we have confounded the prophets of doom; and we shall do so for many, many more years to come. On behalf of the Government of National Unity, I wish to thank all South Africans who have made this, our miracle possible. As a nation, we extend our gratitude to the international community whose force of example, encouragement and support has strengthened us in this difficult task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I also wish to congratulate Minister Ben Ngubane and his team for the excellent work they have done to make this celebration the success that it promises to be. Theirs has been a lofty example of united action in the national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As our nation did a year ago, let each community take its destiny into its own hands by ensuring that everyone registers as a voter by the 1st of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Enriched by the experience of the First Freedom Year, let us work together, with each other and for each other, in the spirit of Masakhane!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Clinton Asary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The game of soccer, as it is so often said, is very unpredictable -- though these days in places like Malaysia this trend is changing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here at home, however, as in most parts of the world, it is still as unpredictable as ever. Ask Randal Borman (20) the Cape Town Spurs and national U23 striker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borman went into last Saturday's Olympic qualifing first leg tie against Burundi at Milpark as the home side's kingpin, having scored in three consecutive games for the Sasol Super Squad. The &quot;hopes of the nation&quot; appeared to have been placed squarely on his shoulders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in an interview shortly before the game, Borman, maybe in foresight, remarked on the ups and downs of the game: &quot;You never know with soccer, one minute you are on top and then suddenly you get a kick,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And how true it proved to be, 90 minutes later Borman went from hero to villain as he first squandered a golden opportunity, driving the ball over the top after he had rounded the goalkeeper, and then, seven minutes from the end, he missed a penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the first chance I was off balance and shot with my weaker foot, but the penalty I shot straight at the goalkeeper, hoping he would dive into one of the corners,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is unlikely that the disappointment against Burundi will keep the talented Capetonian down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borman's uncle Daniel, or &quot;Dot&quot; as he was popularly known, terrorised defences on the Cape Flats as a youngster, then as a professional with Glendene in the old FPL and Randal is looking to do the same but on a much higher level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An injury to Spurs' star striker Shaun Bartlett has seen Borman slot into the striker's position, and do what he does best, score goals. &quot;I have set myself a target of 15 to 20 goals for the season, if I play regularly I am sure I can achieve it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Borman feels that Spurs have put last season's disappointment behind them and are aiming to go one better than the two cup semifinals and losing the league by a point. &quot;We have a good team, with players like Zane Alexander and Andre Arendse, who are playing well, we should do well again this season.  But we have to play more as a unit and not individuals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like any young player Borman also has overseas ambitions, &quot;Before the end of the season I would like to go overseas for trials, just for the experience. If I get a contract though, I will gladly accept it,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for now Borman is working on achieving his main goal for this season, &quot;I want to make the senior national squad, hopefully by the end of this season .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rugby: For the love of the game -- and money by Michael McMurray</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They love rugby in Pretoria and as the World Cup approaches many budding entrepreneurs are showing they love money just as much</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WITH the same mischievous twinkle that a naughty schoolgirl might have in her eyes, Francina de Kock confesses that she doesn't pay to watch any of the rugby matches played at Loftus Versfeld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;During half-time I follow the catering van into gate five and nobody ever stops me. They probably feel sorry for me,&quot; she admits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the ripe old age of 81 Francina surely ranks as one of Pretoria's oldest female rugby supporters, but it's highly unlikely that she will be able to &quot;sneak&quot; through the gates when security measures are tightened at the stadium in preparation for the World Cup in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria is a buzz of excitement as residents eagerly wait in anticipation for the kick-off of one of the world's most hyped and greatest sporting events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only rugby fans are getting caught up in World Cup fever but also those out to make a fast buck from what they are hoping will be a literal flood of foreign currency streaming into the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Marie Pretorius, manageress of the Oorkant Loftus guest house, &quot;I will be increasing my rates for the World Cup period but I'm not out to rob anyone blind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Sunnyside woman who refused to be named said she was planning to rent out two of the rooms at her house for between R600-R700 a day which would exclude meals. She said two groups of Australians were interested but nothing had yet materialised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ingrid Schnetler from Waterkloof Agricultural Holdings will be selling jerseys and pullovers displaying the World Cup logo at between R110-R130.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other ambitious entrepreneurs from Pretoria will be issuing certificates stating that &quot;I was at the Rugby World Cup 1995&quot; to socks, wooden beverage holders, and plastic bottles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rugby World Cup licencee manager Mandy Scalen says a taxidermist from Pretoria had even proposed the idea of a stuffed springbok rump that was actually a liquor dispenser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She says they couldn't endorse the product as it might have damaged the image of the Rugby World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for ordinary fans the only damage they are in danger of is sheer emotional exhaustion as the kick-off day draws closer. Jan Hofmeyr, self-proclaimed Northerns (but now Springbok) rugby fan from Monument Park, says people tend to become overly emotional when it comes to rugby. &quot;People start to think, eat and sleep rugby. For fanatics it's not just a game anymore ... it's a way of life,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A financial and administrative official in charge of suite owners at Loftus Versfeld, Rina Smit, giggles in agreement, &quot;People might not know what the local government elections are but everybody knows about the World Cup&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keith Glass, an accountant from Sunnyside jokingly puts his fascination for the sport down to the fact that he never played soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's the game I grew up with,&quot; says Anneline Jonker from Moreletta Park. &quot;Coming from an Afrikaans household it was simply expected of one, male or female to watch rugby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the more traditional city folk like 21-year-old barman Shawn Alexander, the love of rugby might have something to do with one's testosterone level. &quot;I love rugby as it's a game played by men for men,&quot; he says in macho drawl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rugby might still be a game played by men but judging by its large female following in Pretoria it's not just a game exclusively for men anymore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women enjoy the game just as much as their beer-guzzling male counterparts, albeit for rather peculiar reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trudie Eksteen, a thirtysomething accountant in Pretoria, says her love for the game is dominated by all the good looking men on and off the field. &quot;Some of the male spectators are just soooo sexy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Pretoria, rugby is still the great white sport but recently the game has succeeded in making some tentative inroads. Nike Phahla admits for instance that &quot;my game is still soccer&quot; but adds that his interest in the white-ruled game was piqued when some of his white friends introduced him to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Phahla, who works for a Johannesburg-based security company comprised of former exiled Apla and MK members, there may be more in the World Cup than his awakening interest in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to him, the company was approached by New Zealand regarding possible protection for its players during the World Cup but nothing has been finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, even in Pretoria, there are those wishing the game and the tournament would simply go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What skill do grown men need for chasing after a ball, stomping on each other and taking bite sized chunks out of their opponent's ears?&quot; Michelle Bayford, a fiery red haired sub editor at a children's magazine wants to know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I loathe rugby but the people here (Pretoria) have almost embraced it as a form of religion,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A final year mechanical engineering student at the University of Pretoria, ML Nel, says rugby supporters are hooligans. &quot;Just look at Loftus after a rugby match -- its a pigsty,&quot;he explains. &quot;The only good thing about the World Cup is that it affords all South Africans the chance to make as much money as possible.&quot; -- Digi-News</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Russia has threatened to pull out of the De Beers-run diamond buying and selling cartel, reports Jacques Magliolo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The long-awaited battle between diamond giant De Beers and Russia is looming after last week's threats by the Russian government to pull out of the Central Selling Organisation (CSO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Russia did leave the CSO, would the world diamond market suffer from a major shake-up and would it have serious implications for world diamond prices? After all, experts believe that last year Russia sold 50 percent of an estimated US$2-billion worth of polished and rough diamonds outside the CSO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deputy head of the Russian state precious metals committee, Leonid Gurevich, says the current agreement does not reflect Russia's status as a country which possesses some of the world's richest diamond reserves and they want greater access to world markets. Essentially, it wants to increase its sales outside the CSO from five percent to 20 percent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Gurevich: &quot;Russia is not just seeking the amendment of some provisions of the deal, it wants the whole strategy of dealing with the cartel to be reviewed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It appears that the organisation is also not happy. &quot;The current CSO agreement with Russia expires on December 31 1995 and it is possible that De Beers could stop buying diamonds from Russia,&quot; says De Beers spokesman Andrew Cumine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Russia wants to amend future agreements to allow it to sell greater quantities of diamonds outside the CSO, De Beers is &quot;looking for 100 percent of Russian diamonds to sell through the CSO, plus a sales quota for Russia's existing stockpile, so that it can sell diamonds in an orderly fashion,&quot; says Cumine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In terms of our agreement with Russia, it is the only country which is permitted to sell any quantity of diamonds outside the CSO,&quot; says Cumine.  He adds that reasons for this are historic and were &quot;to allow Russia to check CSO prices against other buyers and thus make sure that the CSO was providing them with a fair deal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a meeting held in March CSO managing director Gary Ralfe made De Beers position on the issue clear. &quot;If the Russians would like to have a close partnership with the CSO then this should be based on the equitable principle that a 100 percent of their production should be flowing through the CSO.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At present De Beers controls 50 percent of the world's production of diamonds. Russian diamond sales represent 26 percent of CSO sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While this may be a substantial stake of the world diamond pie, Cumine believes that Russian production is not increasing. Their mines are old and deep, have to be mined under extremely adverse conditions (they are based in Siberia), no new mines seem to have opened and their seems to be a lack of electrical power to run the mines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to these problems, De Beers believes that even Russia's stockpile is decreasing. &quot;At present we estimate that the stockpile consists of diamonds which are more difficult to sell, such as the good quality and the smaller range diamonds,&quot; says Cumine. &quot;It is only to their advantage to sell these more difficult diamonds through the organisation,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a new five-year agreement, De Beers would insist on a simplification of the negotiation procedures, it would want to know how diamonds are distributed within Russia and the quantity of diamonds produced and stockpiled in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Analysts agree that Russia will kick up a fuss, but will ultimately agree to these terms. The general consensus is that Russia needs hard currency to fund precious metals mines, social welfare, roads and such and could not afford to set up its own client base, nor do they have the necessary technical expertise to create another CSO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After all, the present agreement provides Russia with about $1-billion a year &quot;up front payment for diamonds, in cash,&quot; says Cumine. For the present Russia is not in a position to dictate terms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A barrage of criticism has greeted South Africa's support of the Big five nations at the UN nuclear summit, writes Gaye Davis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH AFRICA has been accused of turning its back on the Third World and cosying up to the United States by supporting the Big Five powers in their bid to hold on to their nuclear bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo backed the Big Five -- the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom -- at the United Nations nuclear non- proliferation summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign policy analyst Peter Vale, professor of Southern African studies at the University of the Western Cape, said South Africa had &quot;buckled under United States' pressure&quot; and warned there would be &quot;a great deal of disquiet within the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Director of South Africa's Group for Environmental Monitoring David Fig said the decision called the independence and integrity of South Africa's foreign policy into question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He slammed foreign policy decision-makers for failing to consult South Africans, saying: &quot;Our new leaders are becoming indistinguishable from the old in their adherence to the foreign policy prescriptions of the rich and privileged countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Countries within the NAM wanted the treaty conditionally extended for a fixed period only in order to pressure the Big Five -- to fully implement its provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Particularly, they wanted an end to failures and delays in implementing Non Proliferation Treaty provisions which would see nuclear powers fully committed to disarming, to giving non-nuclear countries proper guarantees for their own security and to enabling the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa was seen as having particular influence on the issue as the world's first country to unilaterally and voluntarily dismantle its own nuclear weapons programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo's address this week to 178 nations gathered at the United Nations for the NPT review conference effectively dashed any hopes of South Africa's support for the NAM position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo acknowledged the NAM countries' criticisms of the treaty were valid. He urged that the NPT be strengthened in order to ensure nuclear powers did more to meet NPT obligations and suggested proposals for doing so.  But he said the proposals should not be made conditions for the NPT's extension, saying the treaty itself could be weakened if they were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said South Africa was making the proposals in the interests of the greatest possible consensus among treaty states. But critics believe United States threats to withhold nuclear co-operation with South Africa if it went with the NAM countries lie behind the decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vale said: &quot;This foreign policy decision will be seen to be one made by whites in the interests of a world in which white interests are protected and defended. It does not reflect what the majority of people feel about the issue -- South Africa's people have not been consulted at all,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was ridiculous to defend the decision as necessary in the interests of North-South bridge-building, Vale said. &quot;This is a very privileged club which is now licensed to get more nuclear capacity while those outside it are forced to resort to illicit ways of developing a nuclear capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In a sense it is an apartheid treaty -- some countries are in and some are out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Fig: &quot;We are submitting to extreme pressure exerted by the United States to conform to its desires.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa had failed to use the moral ground it acquired when it became the world's first country to unilaterally and voluntarily dismantle its own nuclear weapons arsenal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fig said the decision contributed to the inherent instability of the NPT by putting certain key countries within the NAM outside the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He criticised foreign policy decision-makers for failing to submit South Africa's position to public debate. &quot;We need a new approach to decision-making, not a reproduction of the old alienating system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision was &quot;a severe setback for alliances being built between South Africa, its southern African partners and the Non-Aligned Movement. The position plays into the hands of the existing nuclear weapons states, particularly the United States, which knows the extension of the treaty makes no significant demands on the weapons states to reduce their existing arsenals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The non-aligned countries need strong evidence of good faith in the nuclear weapons' states' willingness to disarm before they can agree to participate in such an unequal non-proliferation regime.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was why South African officials proposed a compromise position of a rolling extension at a preparatory conference in January, Fig said. &quot;This compromise would have opened the way for the resolution of the inequalities in the spirit of global non- proliferation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ANC MP Rob Davies, a member of the parliamentary portfolio committee on foreign affairs, said: &quot;It's a complicated question. There is an unevenness in the process and some Third World countries were seizing on this in order to be able to create nuclear arsenals themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm not sure that this is the direction we should be going in. We should really be trying to close the loopholes which allow other countries to develop arsenals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are advantages in South Africa, which has abandoned its own nuclear programme, taking a stand against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'My only reservation is the indefinite extension (of the NPT) does freeze the status quo as far as existing nuclear powers are concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Washington Post this week reported that United States ambassador to South Africa Princeton Lyman delivered a demarche to Nzo on March 10 which warned a vote against the unconditional extension by South Africa would undermine &quot;mutual interests&quot; and affect Washington's view of South Africa's non-proliferation credentials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newspaper said the demarche also noted the United States had supported South Africa's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group -- an exclusive group of nations generating nuclear power controlling technology sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign Affairs spokesman Coen Snyman could not confirm the demarche.  He said the issue had a long history with &quot;lots of communication between South Africa and the United States. President Clinton wrote to President Mandela about it&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 21, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Anton Harber</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a year in office, South Africa's political leaders are talking defensively. Minister Jay Naidoo speaks, in the language of South Africa's new bureaucrats, about the lack of capacity, the need for rigorous business plans, the demands of fiscal discipline, the absence of effective local government, and other factors that have slowed down implementation of the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gauteng Premier Tokyo Sexwale said last week that you cannot turn around 400 years of history in one year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Housing Minister Sankie Nkondo will tell you about all the preparation she needs to make before starting to build houses. And Health Minister Dr Nkosazana Zuma will tell you about the difficult issues that have to be solved before one can tackle health reform.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are being defensive because if you measure the success of the Government of National Unity in strictly numerical terms -- the number of houses built, the number of people who have access to free health care or potable water -- then it scores disturbingly low.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apart from a few showy (and important) presidential projects, such as the provision of a daily peanut butter sandwich to schoolkids and free health care for infants, all the key ministries such as housing, health and education will tell you that they are still at the stage of policy formulation and structural planning, prior to actual implementation of the RDP. Of course they are. There was never any chance that within a year a whole team of new ministers would come to grips with their new tasks, change their departments, develop the policy positions they need to start with and actually start implementing radically new programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But you don't win elections by saying that in the first year you will write white papers, hire consultants and open matters to public debate. You do it by promising to provide houses, health care and schools. Judged against these pre-election promises, the GNU fails miserably. And that's why it has opened itself up to the crude populist criticism of slow delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this is a simplistic way to judge, because beyond the simple numbers, the ANC has put in place a broad agenda for social change that has already started to make a fundamental impact on the make-up of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of these measures are so far-reaching that they make us world trend-setters in social reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, before Parliament is a new Labour Relations Bill which is aimed at fundamentally changing workplace relations and breaking the tradition of antagonism and conflict. If has been drawn up at breakneck speed and, if passed, will put us in the forefront of modern industrial relations.  The formation of Nedlac, the joint state- business-labour-NGO forum to deal with economic and development issues, puts us ahead of most attempts around the world to create a social contract between these different sectors to overcome the traditional antagonisms of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The health policy proposals due to be handed to the minister by a special committee in the next few weeks is more a case of catching up with the world on basic health care provision -- as is the case with attempts to create equal educational opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these moves are a clear indication that this is one country which has routed those conservatives, masquerading as neo-liberals, who are winning campaigns in most Western and many African countries to cut back the state and withdraw government from these kinds of social policy issues in order to leave reform to the market system. Where President Bill Clinton has failed to create a new social agenda, President Nelson Mandela has succeeded. Where the British Labour Party is struggling to articulate a social democracy for the late 20th century, the ANC is bounding ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is accepted by virtually all South Africans -- even most of the conservative business community -- that the state has a role in redressing the inherited inequalities and creating a better society, as long as it is done within the constraints of fiscal discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is almost universal agreement -- inherent in the fact that all parties have embraced the RDP -- that progress depends on the pragmatic combination of economic growth and tightly-managed reform and redistribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So we see high on the national agenda both the encouragement of foreign investment and such issues as the provision of clean water and equal education opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the social reformers driving this, notably Minister Jay Naidoo, have not only accepted the credo of fiscal discipline -- they have embraced it with all the fervour of new converts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has introduced a new breed of civil servants, often drawn from the ranks of the strugglistas of the 1980s, filling government policy posts to write new policies and laws in every area from industrial strategy to freedom of information. And their agenda is one of social democratic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The role of the private sector has been to try to create a few extremely wealthy and powerful black individuals who would provide a bulwark against accusations that South Africa's most powerful companies are all-white. So white business is financing and advising a line-up of instant millionaires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will undoubtedly have its own, unpredictable, social effects. But much more radical is the reform programme being put in place in almost every government department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When was the last time in any country that policy on everything ranging from policing to pensions was being rewritten? And rewritten in such a way that, if followed through, will change this society so fundamentally that within a decade it will go from being one of the world's least civilised to one of the most progressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has been combined with a formidable human rights structure. The interim constitution creates a Constitutional Court, a Human Rights Commission, a Public Protector, and a Gender Commission. The first of these to be formed, the Constitutional Court, is packed overwhelmingly with individuals who have a proven commitment to human rights and independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has faced two tests of its commitment to constitutionalism and human rights. The one came when Mandela himself had to climb down on the dismissal of his own wife from the cabinet. The other was an attack on press freedom from the Defence Ministry. Heavily criticised by his own party, the Defence Minister backed off. The ANC passed both tests.  Couple this agenda with the prospects for economic growth, said by all experts to be good for the next few years, and the first year of the GNU seems to end as optimistically as it began. The post- election honeymoon continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some significant problems that could send things awry: crime is escalating, the police forces are in disarray, the looting of pensions and other coffers by old-guard bureaucrats continues apace, crude affirmative action so far has done as much good as harm, and there is little sign of an end to the endemic corruption that marked the previous government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The important ministries of welfare, foreign affairs, police and education are weak points -- and President Mandela has not dealt with ineffectual cabinet ministers as toughly as he has dealt with ill-disciplined ones. The policy of openness and accountability is facing a potential backlash from some of those made uncomfortable by aggressive media scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, on a political level, the far-right-wing threat has dissipated, and the Inkatha Freedom Party's ability to disrupt things is much more limited than before. The feel-good factor is high, with the post-inauguration euphoria of national unity proving to be more lasting than expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against this background, the ANC does not have to be overly concerned that it has not met its first-year promises. It has a growing economy, a strong majority, the world's most popular president and the longest- lasting afterglow in recorded history. If serious delivery on the RDP is not under way in two to three years -- prior to the build-up to the next election -- then the ANC will have a headache. It would do well to set more realistic targets for this period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the country thrives on the rich and rare combination of economic growth, fundamental social reform and firm steps to establish a human rights culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How they scored (out of 10)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nelson Mandela (President)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 9.5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mandela would have scored a full 10-star rating a month ago, before the mishandling of the Winnie Mandela saga, and he may be back up there when he puts this issue behind him. But his star-studded performance has been tarnished a little by the messiness of the last few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is easy to talk about Mandela's strengths: his vision, his mixture of strong leadership and a willingness to compromise, his pragmatism, his moral stature, his workaholic habits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is not without his weaknesses: he has been slow to flag down the government gravy train and he has not been firm with ministers performing below par.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But none of this does serious damage to the fact that he is -- both at home and internationally -- the world's most popular and most respected politician. The success of the first year of the GNU, and the strongly humanistic ethos of the new government, can be credited largely to his leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thabo Mbeki (First Deputy President)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki has been increasingly taking over Mandela's tasks, functioning as a de facto prime minister, bringing his suaveness, his political savvy, and his diplomatic experience to bear. Yet he is criticised for not putting his own stamp of authority on matters of state. Instead he functions as a ubiquitous Mr Fix-it, intervening in day-to-day crises and heading various task groups and committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His mishandling of Winnie Mandela's firing raised eyebrows when it became apparent that he was the one who had failed to consult with other party leaders. It seemed to confirm a reputation for inefficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has also sullied his reputation by being seen to back the &quot;populists&quot; in the ANC. Indeed, he had built a political base on their support and is considerably weakened within the ANC when they are on the defensive, as they are at the moment. It is an irony, because Mbeki is no populist -- he is a pragmatic man who has his eyes firmly fixed on his primary goal: ascending to the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is a man never to be underestimated: a skillful political manoeuverer and a man of charm and eloquence, he is a formidable candidate for succession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FW de Klerk (Deputy President)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The former president has struggled to come to terms with his loss of power. Essentially, he has a difficult position: he has only as much authority as Mandela cares to give him and the chemistry between the two of them is lacking. Without any well-defined area of responsibility, he is limited to a narrow role, which carries its own frustrations. He is not allowed to stand in for the president -- rather than have him do so during the president's parliamentary question-time, the institution was done away with. And the ANC makes sure that if Mandela is overseas, Mbeki is there to stand in for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> De Klerk has mostly been heard from when he is having a tantrum about something he is accused of -- and is generally guilty of. The only other time he makes a mark is during his frequent overseas trips (five in the last year, costing R370 000), spreading the GNU gospel and promoting foreign investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As De Klerk grew into the job of president, so he has shrunk into the lesser post. He would do well to consider retiring to be remembered for his remarkable contribution to history, rather than continue to be beset by anxiety over his status and problems within his own caucus. He is now more important to his own party -- where he is the glue holding it together -- than to the GNU itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kader Asmal (Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score 8.5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Groucho Marx lookalike has turned his ministry from an archetype of apartheid bureaucracy into a model of civilian participation. The former law professor has used his intellectual energy and heavyweight status in the ANC to ensure that water and forests now occupy a central role in the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His style of &quot;participatory governance&quot;, which he is trying to develop into an art form, saw dam names neutralised without a backlash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal does not confine himself to his ministry, speaking out on almost anything else that catches his eye, which is why he is known in parliamentary circles as the Minister of Everything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sibusiso Bengu (Minister of Education)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The effects of a stroke suffered shortly after his appointment may still be troubling Bengu; he has not caught up with his late start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More serious is his reluctance to become involved in confrontation; perhaps why he favours long-range planning over short-term fire fighting.  Bengu's response to turmoil in the universities was to set up the National Commission on Higher Education. It will all take time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been some progress in Bengu's year in office; there just hasn't been enough of it. In January, the former 18 education departments were transformed into one national and nine provincial departments and the ministry approved a new (interim) deracialised school syllabus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mangosuthu Buthelezi (Minister of Home Affairs)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If he's not in Cape Town he's in Ulundi. Perceived in Pretoria as a largely absent minister, his director-general (who achieved fame as head of the Independent Election Commission department that failed to deliver ballot papers) effectively runs the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi has guaranteed every South African a passport, and raved a little about illegal immigrants. He brings more skills and experience to the post than most, having served for decades in homeland cabinets -- but is spending most of his time fighting party-political issues. There is little sign that he has come to grips with the biggest headache of his department -- the amount of illegals flowing across South Africa's borders and the hostile, even violent, reception they are receiving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dawie de Villiers (Minister of Environment and Tourism)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there's a motto in the ANC's cabinet caucus it could be &quot;Dump it on Dawie&quot;. The Environment and Tourism minister has faced a barrage of criticism from opponents in the GNU. These range from he &quot;wants to turn us into a garbage ground for other countries' toxic waste&quot; to complaints that the former Springbok rugby captain is out watching matches. But it appears that much of it is motivated by the ambition of his rivals, Deputy Minister Bantu Holomisa and parliamentary committee head Peter Mokaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although De Villiers has made some mistakes -- like coming up with a gobbledygook hazardous waste policy -- tourism is booming and he can take some credit for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pallo Jordan (Minister of Posts and Telecommunications)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jordan is the minister trying to change important institutions by doing as little as possible. He's the hands-off minister, arguing that it is not his role to be too active in running the state -owned corporations that fall within his brief, such as the SABC, Telkom and the Postal Service. A less polite title is the invisible minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He's changed the face of the boards of Telkom and the Postal Service by making new appointments, but appears now to be sitting back to allow the new boards to drive the transformation process -- something ANC colleagues feel he should be doing. The integration of broadcasting and posts and telecommunications services in the ex- bantustans is still in limbo. So is the question of whether the state will fund the SABC to become a proper public service broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Liebenberg (Minister of Finance)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score 7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A responsible and quiet student, Liebenberg has done better than expected this term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dubbed the Kepler Wessels of finance ministers because of his painstakingly methodical approach, he was expected to be cast as lacking in verve because of his predecessor's flamboyance. But Liebenberg has shown up the flaws in Keys' ministerial style. Keys talked endlessly of scrapping the financial rand: Liebenberg actually did it. Keys also saddled Liebenberg with the problem of the rather ad hoc Secondary Tax on Companies. For the business audience, banker Liebenberg says all the right things, while having a keen social conscience. All are impressed by his attention to detail, and his willingness to grapple with the enormous financial problems -- such as public debt -- the GNU inherited. The only criticism is that the colour of his department is still pinko-grey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trevor Manuel (Minister of Trade and Industry)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel has confounded business skeptics with his understanding of the issues facing the country and has quickly gathered around him a core of well-qualified advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His performance in trying to get South African exporters a better deal with Europe in terms of the Lome convention was commendable. He has taken the bull by the horns, signaling an end to protection-on-demand by business, and promising tougher anti-competitive laws. His department was responsible for the Monitor report's scathing criticism of industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, his newfound commitment to competition has less than thrilled the left wing of the party and made some unionists uncomfortable. He has hung tough with both business and unions in beginning the restructuring of the textile and motor industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But so far movement on policy has been slow and there has been insufficient movement in framing an over-arching industrial policy and tougher competition policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tito Mboweni (Minister of Labour)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No department has moved as fast and as effectively as Labour to write new policy, draft new Bills and establish new structures -- all of which have received widespread acclaim. Mboweni's Labour Bill, currently before Parliament, promises far-reaching reform of industrial relations. Much the same breadth of thinking lies behind the formation of Nedlac, the forum for the government, business, labour and non-government organisations to seek common ground on major policy issues. He has also announced a five-year plan for a labour market policy which will stress skills development and job creation. Mboweni has also been studiously independent in labour matters, winning the respect of both unions and business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roelf Meyer (Minister of Constitutional Development, Provincial Affairs and Local Government)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Able and competent, Meyer has been the most impressive of NP ministers. He has the weightiest portfolio of any Nat minister in the GNU and is very much on top of his department, even though he now finds himself trapped in a vacuum as his tasks are usurped by the Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meyer's major challenge is to see through the devolution of power to the provinces -- many of which are not yet sufficiently geared for this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The biggest problems he faces are political, enjoying conspicuous lack of support from his NP colleagues. He is deeply disliked by some who hold him accountable for compromises made during negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Modise (Minister of Defence)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 3</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not known for his ability to think on his feet, Modise leaves much public work to his deputy minister, Ronnie Kasrils. Modise was chosen becuase he was thought to be the military leader who could bring the old-style generals along into the new order. But often it appears that they are dragging him backwards into the old order. Ironically, the rebellion came not from the old guard, but from the new recruits -- the MK and Apla cadres who were furious with the survival of the old army culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Modise has succeeded in bringing in a significant number of new officers and set up the Cameron Commission of inquiry to investigate covert arms deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A defence White Paper has yet to appear. His department is also criticised for being less than transparent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Derek Hanekom (Minister of Land Affairs)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hanekom likes to say he qualified for his post by keeping a few cows and making the best yoghurt in the Magaliesberg, before being jailed in the 1980s. But anyone who thought Hanekom would run his ministry like a rural commune was wrong. He set in motion sophisticated land reform programmes and has achieved more than any other ministry in dealing with apartheid's legacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He promotes himself as the &quot;comrade minister&quot;, spending time tramping around rural areas. The only complaints come from colleagues left to carry out &quot;Derek's decrees&quot;, frequent and rash promises to rural communities that &quot;you will get your land back within months&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mac Maharaj Minister of Transport</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maharaj has been uncharacteristically quiet in the Cabinet, perhaps because of his peripheral post. He has moved to defuse taxi conflicts. and has also taken important steps to deal with the airport system, a critical factor for tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankie Nkondo (Minister of Housing)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkondo's relatively low profile since stepping into Joe Slovo's shoes, points to the extent to which she was initially overwhelmed. However, she is now coming to grips with it. But it is still too early to assess her performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sydney Mufamadi (Minister of Safety and Security)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To be fair to Mufamadi, he has been given one of the hardest tasks of all. The police force is disunited, underpaid, overworked, discontented and barely competent. He has to undertake not just massive restructuring to turn it into a decentralised, civilian force, but teach it new skills and new attitudes. At the heart of his policy is community policing, now being adopted by members of the force around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no sign yet of the new Police Bill, though Mufamadi has forced out the truculent old commissioner, made an astute choice for a new one, and appointed nine regional commissioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sipho Mzimela (Minister of Correctional Services)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mzimela got off to a slow start in terms of transforming Correctional Services. An amendment to the Correctional Services Act prohibits the jailing of awaiting-trial children and he has planned youth development centres for young offenders. Mzimela eased pressure on overcrowded prisons without resorting to the &quot;bursting&quot; process of his predecessor. Prison riots saw him doing a good deal of firefighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jay Naidoo (Minister without portfolio)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Naidoo's greatest achievements have been the crafting of a new language, RDP-speak, and the adoption of a new state religion, fiscal discipline. He uses these to explain why there is so little delivery of the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some have called him the Chris Heunis of the new order: he speaks in riddles, is minister of everything and of nothing, and has a propensity for producing organograms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ben Ngubane ( Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ngubane's best friends would probably admit he got off to a bad start, due to his unfamiliarity with cloak-and- dagger cultural politics, and an unworkable relationship with then-Deputy Minister Winnie Mandela. He admitted to having blundered in donating R1-million in state money to a private-sector trust fund. But things have speeded up with a bold restructuring of performing arts councils. The diplomatic and easy-going Ngubane has been the surprise success among IFP ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfred Nzo (Minister of Foreign Affairs)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 2</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nzo is lucky that South Africa is riding the wave of international acclaim, hiding the fact that there is no coherent foreign policy beyond recognising the need to send the president and his two deputies on regular trips to raise investment. The policy gap is due largely to the fact that Nzo has woken up only occasionally in the last year: to make the occasional boring speech and to argue for the retention of old-guard Director General Rusty Evans. But give Nzo his due -- he is only there to ensure that others, such as Mbeki and Mandela, can do the real foreign work. He should be allowed to retire soon and stop all this tiring travel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dullah Omar (Minister of Justice)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 9</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African justice is not what it used to be. Lay people are sharing the bench with magistrates in court. South Africans will no longer serve time in prison simply because they cannot repay a financial debt. Plain language is replacing legalistic gobbledygook. Justice Ministers from all over Southern Africa are talking about regional co-operation. The truth commission is going to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the change is deeper than these outward signs. For the first time ever, South Africa has a Justice Ministry concerned with administering justice as opposed to laying down the law. This is due to the tireless efforts of Omar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jeff Radebe (Minister of Public Works)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score:6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Radebe wins his stars for his dramatic and unprecedented confrontation with his most senior official last week. Prior to that, he would have scored low for lack of progress on his ambitious public works programme. This tardiness may now be explained by the behaviour of his bureaucrats -- but he will have to prove it by making up for lost time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stella Sigcau (Minister of Public Enterprises)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The best that can be said about Sigcau so far is that she has done no harm -- largely because she hasn't done much at all, except accept the inevitability of some privatisation. If it is to happen, it will need a champion. Sigcau, however, has so far lacked the conviction and status to drive the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zola Skweyiya (Minister of Public Service and Administration)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 5</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His is the most difficult portfolio -- changing the face and character of the civil service. Change in every other government department depends on his policies. Skweyiya has come under fire from ANC colleagues for not moving fast or decisively enough. Nonetheless he's managed to come through the year without wide scale disruptions, has employed advisors with strong negotiating skills, and is making progress, albeit slow, on policy issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Tshwete (Minister of Sport)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sport evokes passions among South Africans of every pigment, so the person controlling it has to be a skillful negotiator. Tshwete is such a person: he rescued South Africa's Olympic bid and has guided sports development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andre 'Kraai' van Niekerk (Minister of Agriculture)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Score: 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any intentions which Van Niekerk might have to transform South African agriculture will have to be realised within the parameters set by Land Affairs and Water Affairs. A major part of his job will be to impart farming skills to those who have recently acquired land and drag the white Agricultural Union into the new era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Revolutionary United Front, RUF, a rebel movement in Sierra Leone, appears to be bowing to international pressures to release foreign hostages it is currently holding. Last Tuesday, the RUF freed seven Catholic nuns who had been in its custody since January 25 this year. They were captured along with some Sierra Leoneans in Kambia, west of Freetown, the country's capital.  The freed nuns, six Italians and a Brazilian, were among the 17 foreign hostages captured in January.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Announcing their release in Abidjan, the Ivorien capital last week, the RUF promised that the remaining foreign hostages would be freed in due course. It said, however, that the British nationals still in their custody would regain their freedom when the British government stops military assistance to the government in Freetown. But the foreign and commonwealth office in London said the RUF allegation was unfounded. It said it would be in the movement's own interest to free the British nationals without delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the whereabouts of the British nationals are known, that of Roger Graf, a Swiss national is still unknown. Graf was believed to be one of the 17 foreign nationals abducted by the rebels but the RUF said last week it had no knowledge of his whereabouts. Alimany Sankoh, the political and foreign affairs coordinator of RUF, said the movement had already notified the Swiss ambassador in Accra, Ghana, that Graf was not one of the foreign nationals it has been holding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sankoh's statement was silent on the fate of hundreds of Sierra Leoneans held hostage by the RUF. Analysts said the silence might be prompted by the decision of the movement to conscript captured Sierra Leoneans into the RUF army to swell its rank. Before last week, there had been reports that many Sierra Leoneans were either forced to join the RUF army or compelled to undertake sundry duties for the movement. Those who resisted conscription were either killed outright or tortured to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week's partial release of the foreign hostages and a promise to free the others later was, indeed, a volte- face for the RUF. Before then, it had vowed to hold on to them until their countries stopped giving political, economic and military assistance to the Valentine Strasser-led National Provisional Ruling Council, NPRC. The volte-face has triggered speculations in diplomatic circles of a possible deal between the RUF and the Catholic church to facilitate the release of the nuns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Georgio Bikusi, the Catholic bishop of Makeni, who played a major role in securing their release, said there was no deal with the RUF whatsoever. According to him, the rebels attached no strings to the release of the nuns. He was echoing the claim of the Vatican that the nuns were released purely on humanitarian ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hostage-taking was adopted by the RUF as a warfare strategy five months ago. The first victims were two Britons abducted in Kabala, a northern town. The NPRC said the RUF resorted to that strategy because it cold no longer hold on to any territory. But RUF sources said the strategy was designed to cripple the mining sector and ultimately ground the country's economy. Apart from the nuns now freed, most of the remaining hostages were engineers working at the Bauxite Mining Company and the Rutile Company, another mining firm. The effect of the strategy is already telling on the economy as government is overstretching its finances to prosecute the war and keep the administration going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RUF said last week that if its plans work out successfully, the capture of Freetown was just a matter of time. Reports have indicated that the RUF militia are already 60 kilometers away from Freetown which is the only city so far spared from the ravages of the war. The presence of Nigerian and Guinean troops in the ECOWAS peace-monitoring group, ECOMOG has halted the advance of the rebels on the Sierra Leonean capital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newswatch April 3, 1995 by Wale Akin Aina</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, chairman of the National Constitutional Conference is convinced that the conference is now set to complete its assignment. Last Wednesday, he emphatically told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that all issues before the conference had been concluded. &quot;There is nothing unresolved as of today,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His conviction is note borne out by developments at the conference which is already five months behind schedule. It was to have wound up at the end of last October. But up-till now the conference has not adopted a definite time-table or a deadline for the completion of its work. On March 29, the conference rejected a motion for the conclusion of debates on the draft constitution and final presentation to the Provisional Ruling Council, PRC. According to a proposal by Olusola Saraki, head of the business committee, the conference was to go on a two-week recess on April 6 and on resumption, April 24, conclude debates and present the draft constitution by May 4.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karibi-Whyte disagreed with the motion because he said that he was only aware of the two-week adjournment period last Thursday, the motion was represented and passed. In effect, this means that the conclusion of work by the conference would remain open-ended after the recess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, conference delegates were still arguing over the constitutional provision for a permanent or transitional rotational presidency. Some burning issues might disrupt the conference and thus prolong it work. One of these is rotational presidency. Karibi-Whyte told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that as far as he was concern, the issue had been resolved.  According to him, the conference had decided that the presidency shall rotate between the north and south and this has been reflected in Section 227 of the draft constitution. Quoting Order 40, rule five of the guidelines on conference debates which states that whatever is concluded by the conference cannot be re-opened, Karibi-Whyte said: &quot;We are not going back on the decision of the conference. There can be no amendment of Section 227.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His position is quite different from that of Mamman Nasir, his deputy at the conference. Nasir, chairman of the constitution drafting committee, CDC, had said that rotational presidency was still an unresolved issue. This is not the first time Nasir's position would be contrary to that of officials of the conference. At the completion of the work of the CDC last January, Nasir had raised a number of issues which he said was yet to be resolved by the CDC. This includes the question of whether or not the secretary to government should also head the civil service. This had shocked fellow members of the CDC who felt that Nasir was trying to buy time to elongate military rule by unnecessarily delaying conference decision. Karibi-Whyte told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that Nasir was making the issue of rotational presidency a political one. &quot;He was head of the CDC which drafted the report. Why did he not put the transitional clause as the head of the drafting committee?&quot; he queried. He said that even those insisting on an amendment of Section 227 want rotational presidency for a transitional period of 24 years. This, he said, is not workable because the president will serve for a term of five years. &quot;Who will do a four-year term so that we can conclude the 24-year transitional period that is being suggested?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karibi-Whyte said that the issue of a transitional clause in Section 227 is a waste of time adding, &quot;if they want to waste their time adding, &quot;if they want to waste their time they can do so, but we are not going to bring it (Section 227) back.&quot; But last Thursday, 17 northern delegates led by Isa Kachako, a retired colonel, held a press conference and threatened they would not endorse the draft constitution if it was not explicitly stated that rotational presidency should be transitional. &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that as at the end of last week, some northern delegates had endorsed the presentation of a minority report of the draft constitution to the PRC. Kachako and his group said they had no confidence in Karibi-Whyte. &quot;Newswatch&quot; also learnt that there has been moves to pass a vote of no-confidence on the chairman and possibly impeach him. Karibi-Whyte said that he was not taking such moves seriously. &quot;I have heard talk of this, &quot; he told &quot;Newswatch&quot;, &quot;but there is no provision to impeach me. I would simply have ruled such actions out of order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The position of the northern delegates showed that efforts at resolving the issue of rotational presidency had fallen through. The last of such efforts was the formation of a &quot;working our committee&quot; compromising three delegates each from the north and the south. The committee was jointly header by Abba Kyari, a retired brigadier-general and former governor of North-Central State and Alex Ekwueme, former vice-president &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt that some southern delegates queried Ekwueme's mandate for speaking for them. They were said to have insisted that there should be no change in the draft constitution that the presidency should rotate between north and south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Ismaila Isa, publisher of the &quot;Democrat&quot; newspapers and a conference delegate from Katsina State, said that rotational presidency on a permanent basis was not acceptable to the north. &quot;That is final, &quot; he declared. He told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that the north had accepted rotational presidency on principle and as a show of good faith for delegates from the west who had come to the conference at the risk of their lives and property following the crisis of the annulled presidential elections of June 12, 1993.  According to him, &quot;we felt that they should have something to show back home as heroes and not blacklegs. We never foresaw that rotational presidency should come into the constitution as a permanent feature.&quot; Isa said that those who are insisting on making rotational presidency permanent in the constitution were out to sabotage the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Olumuyiwa Oladimeji, a delegate from Osun State, said that the south cannot negotiate rotational presidency. &quot;It is only people that believe that they have a monopoly of political power who are afraid of rotational presidency,&quot; he said. According to him, the original position of the south was that there should be rotation among six zones in the country, &quot;but we had to make terrible concessions to agree to these narrow two zones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Oladimeji said it was surprising that those to whom they made concessions were now trying to jettison rotational presidency. He said &quot;If they are now going to reject it then we go back to our six zones.&quot; He said that if there was going to be a minority report on the rotational presidency, then the south would also have to present minority reports on several issues that were conceded. This, he said, include revenue allocation, zone structure and commands for the police, amongst others. &quot;The presidency will have more than enough minority reports if people want to write a minority report on rotational presidency,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Larinde Akinleye, a delegate from Oyo State, also disagreed with Isa's statement that the north acted in good faith in accepting rotational presidency. He said that northern delegates were not helping the conference by making an issue out of rotational presidency. &quot;They should be tolerant enough to accommodate the decisions of the conference,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The section of the draft constitution dealing with rotational presidency is not specific on whether or not it should be permanent or transitional. Subsection 1 of Section 227 simply states that &quot;The election to the office of president shall rotate between the North and the 'South.&quot; Subsection 4 of the same section states that states carved our from former Northern region, including the Federal Capital Territory, FTC, Abuja shall represent the North while states carved out from the former Eastern and Western regions, including the Federal Territory of Lagos, shall be deemed to be the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the issue first came up at the power-sharing committee level, it could not be resolved. The committee passed it to the conference. After heated debates, the conference appointed a consensus committee, headed by Saraki to resolve the matter. Last October 8, the consensus committee presented its report which stated that the presidency should rotate alternately between the north and the south. On October 17, J.A. Rowiaye, a delegate from Ogun and a member of the power-sharing committee, proposed that rotation as a transitional measure be deleted from the report of the power-sharing committee. His contention was that when the committee included traditional clause in it report, it did so on the basis that power should rotate among six proposed zones. He said that now that it was to rotate between just two zones, there was no reason why it should remain transitional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rowaiye's motion was defeated but the transitional clause was also not included in the draft constitution. So, the issue of whether rotational presidency should be transitional or not became a conundrum. The northern delegates argue that since the move by Rowaiye to delete the transitional clause in the committee report failed, the draft constitution should be amended to reflect that the rotation was transitional and it should also state the period. On the other hand, southern delegates say that the consensus committee between the north and the south should be transitional.  They, therefore, argued that any amendment on the draft would be by consensus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This appears to agree with Karibi-Whyte's view. He told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last week that since the decision of the conference was arrived by consensus, it would also be changed by consensus. He added: &quot;Since there is no consensus we have to discountenance it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even with this, some delegates from the north are questioning the composition of the Saraki consensus committee. They, for instance, say that for a consensus committee to be truly constituted, it must be representative of all states and as such must have nominated members from all states. This, they claim, was not done by Karibi-Whyte. Also, they queried the nature of the consensus after observing that Saraki and Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, who was also a member of the consensus committee, openly disagreed on the floor of the conference on the decision reached by the committee. The northern delegates also claim that no written report was presented to the conference by the consensus committee. According to Isa, the members of the committee did not append their names or signatures to any resolution. He declared: &quot;I challenge them to show us their resolution or any document they have endorsed when they arrived at the decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The controversy over rotational presidency raised fears that the conference may be extending the tenure of the government of Sani Abacha, the head of state. Last Tuesday, Paulinus Akpeki, a delegate from Delta State, said at a press conference that the conference had itself worked against the January 1, 1996, date it set for the military last December. Akpeki, one of the opponents of the date, said he felt vindicated because the &quot;January 1, 1996 date was hastily taken and was unrealistic and hence impracticable.&quot; He said that the ultimatum to the military was ill-advised and noted that five months after it was supposed to have wound up, the conference was still debating the draft constitution and report of its resolutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that the earlier date of October 1997, suggested by the conference transition committee and rejected by the conference, should have been ideal considering that the committee headed by Barnabas Gernade listed component parts of the transition which included the establishment of a new electoral commission, formation of political parties, registration of voters and creation of states. This situation apparently favours Akpeki, who has always insisted that the conference has no business setting a terminal date for the military. Though he had last January drawn a transition programme to terminate military rule in had not been taken seriously by other delegates who saw his move as political posturing. His expected motion for the extension of military rule last January never saw the light of day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akpeki denied that he was a proponent for an extension of military rule. He told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that even the 1997 date might prove unrealistic. He said it was now uncertain when the draft constitution would be presented to the PRC. He said that up-till now, the conference was yet to draw up a programme of transition for the military and that it shows that it is about to wind up deliberations soon. The present situation tallies with an earlier &quot;Newswatch&quot; report which last January spoke of moves to delay the submission of the draft constitution till June 1995 and thereby make it impossible for a transition programme to be worked out in the remaining months of the year.  This conforms with the programme proposed for government by pro-military groups who want 1997 as the exit date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Are the delegates being teleguided to use delaying tactics to prolong military rule? The frequent adjournments by the conference seems to suggest so. This year alone, the conference has adjourned two times. When it resumed last January 9, it sat for less than 48 hours and went on a two-month recess.  By Thursday, it would go on another long recess. Also, opinion are divided over the foot-dragging attitude of delegates. A conference delegate said some delegates were afraid of losing the generous allowances of N25,000 a month and the bonus paid to every member at special religious holidays. Sources close to Aso Rock said that long adjournments would enable the government deliver &quot;welfare packages&quot; to delegates. This can be as much as N75,000 during the recess periods to cover Easter expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to the presidency also said that many delegates lobbied for ministerial appointments. Eight of them were appointed into Abacha's new cabinet. The source told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that now that there are speculations that the head of state had directed that administrators should dissolve their cabinets and the care-taker committees of local governments, conference members have again been lobbying for political appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other political commentators, however, feel that those who want to drag the conference back were doing a bidding of the military. There are strong suspicions that this was why the delegates began debates on the second volume of the drafting committee report with suggestions that it should again review all the reports of the various committees, one by one before adopting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some delegates said this was necessary because these were in the second volume of the report that ought to be included in the draft constitution. One of these is the issue of creation of new states and local governments. Although creation of specific states is not a constitutional matter, the constitutional drafting committee seemed to have included additional states and local governments which were not in the original report of the committee for state creation. For instance, the drafting committee report recommended two states to be created out of Benue State. These are Apa with capital at Otukupo and Katsina-Ala with capital at Zaki-Biam. The original report only recommended the creation of Apa State. In Akwa Ibom, they recommended the creation of Atlantic State, comprising of Oron in Akwa Ibom and Calabar in Cross Rivers State. They also recommended the creation of Itai State which will have Ikot-Ekpene as capital. The report of the state creation committee had recommended the creation of Itai state. For local government, the drafting committee report recommended the creation of two new local governments form Oju local government of Benue State. These are Obi and Oyongo. But strangely, it changed the headquarters of Oju local government form Oju to Ichakobe, a development said to be raising tension in the area.  Also out of the Nsukka local government area in Enugu State, the committee recommended three new local governments: Ovogovo, Nsukka and Nsukka South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, indegenes of the Nsukka local government, led by E.A.  Obayi, complained to the conference that at no time did they canvass or ask for three local governments. They claimed that the recommendation by the drafting committee was contrary to the one by the conference committee on states and local governments last September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, in its recommendations, the drafting committee did not name the constituent areas of the new states or local governments and, in some cases, did not even list state capitals or local government headquarters. The capital of the recommended Atlantic State was not mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With these lapses, some conference delegates reason that it might be tempting for the government to delay the handing over of power while it proceeds to reassess the recommendations of the conference. When he visited Nigeria two weeks ago, Jimmy Carter, the former American president, cautioned against implementing all the recommendations of the conference. He said that it might be misinterpreted as excuse by the military to delay handling over to an elected government. Carter specifically said that the creation of states should not constitute a prelude to the transfer of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government has so far left the conference alone with its controversies. Despite the rancour generated by the rotational presidency, government has said nothing. In 1989, when the issue of the sharia was about to derail the constituent assembly, the administration of former President Ibrahim Babangida intervened. Augustus Aikhomu, former vice-president, in a stern speech, called the assembly to order and barred further discussion on the sharia. Also in 1978, under the Olusegun Obanjo regime, when the same issue of the sharia threatened the constituent assembly, the government intervened using a combination of carrot and stick to get back into the assembly the pro-sharia group, led by Shehu Shagari, who had staged a walk-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, government officials told &quot;Newswatch&quot; that the government does not want to get involved in the constitutional conference so that its actions might not be misinterpreted. Appointment of eight delegates into the cabinet would suggest that government is not particularly keen on the outcome of its work. Fred Chijuka, brigadier-general and spokesman for the defence headquarters, said that this would in no way affect the constitutional conference. He said that &quot;if one third of the members are still there, then the job of the day is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chijuka said he does not see this as a strategy by Abacha to stay on, adding that &quot;no military government would want to say put in this country with all these political hawks around.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Olademeji told &quot;Newswatch&quot; all these issues do not have to affect the process of democratisation by government. He said: &quot;I like to hope that the government we have is committed to the democratisation process.&quot; he said that although there were some people who do not agree with majority or consensus opinion, &quot;this should not be an excuse for government to delay the political democratisation process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by H.E. Flt. Lt. J.J. Rawlings, Speech given at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, Washington, DC</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May I first express my appreciation to the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies and the Constituency for Africa for providing this opportunity to share with you Ghana's experience in the field of conflict resolution and peacekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end of the Cold War raised high hopes for a new and stable international order which would be characterized by cooperation among and within states, rather than by polarization, rivalry and conflict. However, within a relatively short time these optimistic expectations have been severely jolted by the aggravation of old conflicts and outbreak of new ones, often with frightening intensity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The spate of conflicts in Afghanistan, Liberia, Somalia, Rwanda, Bosnia, in some of the former states of the former Soviet Union , and along the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border has made it evident that we are not at peace simply because Cold War is over. Indeed we may be facing stark realities which were previously masked by the overpowering images of super power rivalry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The search for effective approaches to conflict prevention, resolution and management highlights the importance of understanding the local context of theses conflicts, the underlying social and cultural forces that are tugging away at the heart of nations and communities, which in the past might have been disregarded in favour of global power explanation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In looking for ways to end such disputes and conflicts, the world has naturally tended to look upon the United Nations as the framework of action by the international community. Despite the imperfections revealed by its operations in Somalia and Bosnia, the united Nations has acquired a wealth of experience through its involvement in efforts to resolve a wide variety of disputes and, therefore may be expected to have the flexibility that is required to deal with different conflict situations. In addition, in places like Nicaragua, El Salvador, Cambodia, South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique and in Angola it has recorded remarkable successes, which often tend to be ignored when strident criticisms are leveled against the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghanaians take pride in our active participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Although we are a relatively small country with limited resources, we have been most willing to commit our forces wherever required in the interest of peace, and to act in concert with other member states to share and shoulder collective international responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the early '60s, Ghana participated in its first major UN operation in the newly independent state of Congo (now Zaire). Ghana has since contributed contingents of troops, military observers, police and electoral officials to the following United Nations peacekeeping operations: UN Emergency Force, Egypt, 1973-78; UN Interim Forces in Lebanon, 178-95; UN Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan, 1988-92; UN Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, 1988-90; UN Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission, 1990-95; UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, 1992-95; UN Protection Force, ex-Yugoslavia, 1992-95; UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, 1993-94; and UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, 1994-95. We sent troops to Rwanda even when most countries still hesitates, and we have maintained a continuous presence to help alleviate the suffering and put an end to the human tragedy in our sister African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have taken the liberty of detailing Ghana's involvement in global peacekeeping in order to highlight Ghana's commitment to the lofty ideals and objectives of the UN, the organisation which is our best hope in for world peace and security. It is indeed, a pleasure to recall the glowing tribute paid to the Ghana Armed Forces in Accra by the US Deputy Secretary of State, Mr. Strobe Talbott, when he said, and I quote, &quot;Ghana has played a very important role in peacekeeping, going back thirty years to when it sent troops to the Congo; and, of course, it distinguished itself both in the multiplicity of missions that Ghanaian armed forces have undertaken over the years and also with the distinction and professionalism, with which the Ghanaian Armed Forces have carried out those missions. All of us were very impressed in those horrible days in April in Rwanda when the Ghanaian unit was the only one on the ground in Rwanda to stand its ground,&quot; unquote. There could be no better tribute to the memory of the Ghanaian soldiers who have lost their lives during peacekeeping duties than the thoughts expressed by Deputy Secretary, Mr. Strobe Talbott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About half of our armed forces are presently engaged in UN peacekeeping activities in one form or another, in fulfillment of our solemn commitment and obligation to the world community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the current atmosphere of concern about the efficacy of the UN as a tool for dealing with conflict situations, one aspect often overlooked is the positive contributions that some developing countries have made in UN operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Good news from Africa is often lost, especially to those who feel far geographically and mentally from our continent. Africa has been making important contributions to United Nations efforts. More African states are willing to participate in UN peacekeeping activities. Within the framework of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of member states, has still been possible for the OAU to acknowledge the realities on the continent and create its own Conflict Prevention, Resolution and Management mechanism, which is expected to play a more active role in the resolution of conflicts in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the sub-regional level, also, concerted efforts have been made to deal with African conflicts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In East Africa, the Inter-Governmental Association on Drought and Development (IGADD), which was originally scheduled to deal with the Sahelian drought as been mediating in the civil war in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Southern Africa, Presidents Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and Quett Masire of Botswana, within the framework of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), undertook joint efforts in helping to resolve the crisis in Lesothos and have also been involved in the search for a peaceful settlement of the Mozambican and Angolan crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In West Africa, in August 1990, the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) which embraces 16 states including Ghana, sent its first contingent of troops drawn from Gambia, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone and Ghana intervene in the Liberian civil war. This marked the first time that an African sub-regional organization had intervened with military forces in one of its member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to launch the ECOMOG operation was purely humanitarian- to deal with a situation of the collapse of a nation state that was having face repercussions for the whole region. Thousands of refugees from other countries in the sub-regions were trapped in Liberia, sometimes being used as apes in the conflict. About half a million refugees had pored over the borders into neighboring states. Thousands of West Africans have lost their lives as a result of this conflict. The Liberian civil war constituted a clear threat to peace and stability in the area which hindered efforts to promote regional integration and regional economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since then ECOWAS has made several efforts at resolving the Liberian civil war. Our efforts have been hampered by our resource constraints, but we have persisted nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in this regard that ECOWAS is appreciative of the supportive role that the US has played in the search for a solution to the conflict, though many were surprised at the initial distance that the US Government seemed to adopt in the early stages of the Liberian crisis were well summed up by Adlai Stevenson &quot;Making peace is harder than making war&quot;, nut making peace is infinitely more regarding for humanity than making war and causing so much suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have certainly learnt some useful lessons from our involvement in the Liberian conflict. It has become increasingly clear to us that even with the noblest of intentions, it is difficult for a third party or a mediator to play an effective and successful role in the face of intransigence by one or more of the parties. Peace cannot really be imposed or forced, it must be made, molded, often with limited logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation is all the more difficult where civil or governmental authority has completely broken down. The involvement of outside powers which may be siding with any of the parties to the conflict is equally a hindrance to peaceful resolution of such conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conflicts resolution and peacemaking are further hindered when the multinational peacemaking entity lacks either the resources or the resolve to maintain peace, or where the positions of its member countries on issues are not consonant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Essentially, the primary responsibility for the resolution of such conflicts resides with the major domestic warring factions and their external supporters, and unless they recognize the need to show accommodation and cooperation, it is difficult for anybody to impose a solution which would be just and lasting. Ultimately what the warring parties aspire to is what Woodrow Wilson described in 1917 as &quot;peace without victory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our experience in Liberia has further confirmed the need for the international community to devise a strategy and mechanism not only for prompt and effective delivery of assistance to refugees, and for demobilization and reconstruction, but more so for the prevention of such conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are convinced that in the long term it is more cost-effective to institute measures to prevent the outbreak of conflicts than to search for solutions when the conflict has already occurred. Preventive diplomacy has the incalculable benefit of saving lives, often in the hundreds of thousands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also recognize that in any global strategy for conflict resolution, regional and sub-regional actors or players should be given a prominent role.  It is our view that the geographical realities of a conflict may impact on its resolution. Regional involvement, in tandem with the UN, and bolstered where necessary by additional bilateral assistance may therefore be more effective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We therefore appreciate the efforts that the US is making under the Africa Resolution Conflict Act passed by Congress last year to assist the OAU improve upon the capacity-building of its conflict resolution mechanism. In the same vein, we welcome recent initiative taken by the Clinton Administration to extend US support for conflict resolution mechanism in Africa to the sub-regional and bilateral levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While these efforts at regional sub-regional and bilateral capacity building are in progress, the international community will have to continue to rely on the UN. It is therefore, disheartening to note that at the moment, the UN does not have the capacity to enable it play the effective role envisaged for it under the Charter. The end of the Cold War has provided multilateral cooperation -- that had long been limited by the US-Soviet Union rivalry -- with a golden opportunity to use the UN as a vehicle for effective peacekeeping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this regard, we in Ghana commend the Clinton Administration for putting a premium on conflict resolution issues as part of its foreign policy agenda. It is important that the U.S. acts effectively in pre-empting some of these conflict situations and not wait till these degenerate into carnage whose horrific exposure on American TV will so outrage the American population that the US will still eventually get involved, but perhaps with too little and too late to prevent human suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the connection, we recognize that even with the end of the Cold War, it may not always be possible for the United States to provide men for UN peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, assistance in providing logistic support, supplies, intelligence and communication is vital. Equally important, the leadership of the US must continue to mobilize international interest in the early resolution of regional disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations, like any human organization, requires sound moral leadership if it is to be effective and successful. Ghana for its part, will play an active role in the UN, the OAU and ECOWAS to prevent conflicts, and when they do occur, to help to resolve them promptly and cost effectively.  The United States also should continue to work in partnership with other states in maintaining peace and security.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Report Summary by Amnesty International</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ethiopian authorities are prosecuting officials of the former government for gross human rights violations, but the Transitional Government has not acted with equal determination against abuses by its own forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Transitional Government was established in 1991 after 17 years of brutally repressive rule. The general election scheduled for May 1995 marks the end of the four-year transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Transitional Government took on the crucial task of bringing to justice officials of the former government responsible for gross human rights violations. The trials have started after long delays and will continue for some years. If they are fair and do not result in executions -- which are themselves violations of human rights -- they will send a message to all perpetrators of human rights violations that they cannot expect impunity and will be held accountable for their actions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the transitional period has also seen many new abuses of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thousands of opponents of the Transitional Government were detained without charge or trial between 1992 and 1994. The majority have now been released but there are still hundreds of political detainees. Some political prisoners have possibly been given unfair trials; as more detainees are being brought to court this is of growing concern. Some detainees are prisoners of conscience, including journalists and members of non-violent opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dozens of government opponents have &quot;disappeared.&quot; People have been held in secret detention centres, and torture has been inflicted on suspected members of opposition groups. A number of defenceless civilians have been shot dead by the security forces. Abuses have also been committed by armed opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Transitional Government has not been consistent in its approach to accountability for human rights abuses. It has not done enough to stop and prevent human rights violations, especially in the context of the Oromo Liberation Front's continuing armed opposition. The international community too has paid insufficient attention to continuing reports of violations. The important message of the trials of former officials will be undermined unless decisive action is taken to stop human rights violations perpetrated by those in power now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This report is about the human rights record of President Meles Zenawi's four-year Transitional Government. It is based on extensive research by Amnesty International and the outcome of Amnesty International's latest talks with the Ethiopian government in February 1995. The meetings discussed a detailed memorandum submitted by Amnesty International to the government three months earlier and the report incorporates the government's response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report documents human rights violations in Ethiopia since 1991, including the imprisonment of non-violent critics of the government; detentions without charge or trial of other government opponents, some of whom were involved in violent opposition; &quot;disappearances&quot;; torture; and political killings by the security forces and by opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also describes the first stages of the trials of officials of the former Dergue and Workers Party of Ethiopia governments headed by Lieutenant-Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam between 1974 and 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report concludes with a series of recommendations for urgent action to end and prevent human rights violations. The Ethiopian government should be more open and consistent in its approach to human rights by acknowledging and redressing violations. It should look more closely at its own record and deal with present as well as past abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This summarizes a 58-page document (23,360 words), Ethiopia: Accountability past and present: human rights in transition (AI Index: AFR 25/06/95), issued by Amnesty</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa Policy Information Center Update</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 30, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Congress returns from recess after the Easter vacation, the Republican majority will be continuing its drive to make fundamental changes in national priorities, on both domestic and international issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cuts in the current year's budget (rescissions) voted by the House and Senate before the recess took $60 million from funds previously approved for the International Development Association (the World Bank's soft loan affiliate), $62 million from the African Development Fund (associated with the African Development Bank), $15 million from international peacekeeping, and $12.5 million from bilateral economic assistance. They also mandated an additional $125 million in additional foreign operations cuts to be specified by the administration's Office of Management and Budget. The supplemental bills including these cuts also failed to approve the administration's supplemental request for $672 million for payment of overdue U.S.  peacekeeping obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal by Senator Mitch McConnell to remove $110 million from the bilateral Development Fund for Africa (one-eighth of the total $802 million) was, however, defeated by intense lobbying and grass-roots mobilization by a number of Africa advocacy groups, including the Washington Office on Africa, the American Committee on Africa, Bread for the World, Interaction, and others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Coming up in May: (1) Both the House and Senate will be considering budget resolutions for Fiscal Year 1996, which begins in October 1995. The roughly $20 billion international affairs &quot;150&quot; account, which includes development aid and peacekeeping as well as operating expenses for the State Department and other agencies, may be cut drastically, by as much as $2.6 billion to $5 billion. Since many items in the account, such as operating expenses and funding for Israel and Egypt, will be protected, a lower &quot;150&quot; limit will put the greatest pressure on the most vulnerable items: peacekeeping and development aid for other regions. Groups including Interaction &lt;ia@interaction.org&gt; and Church World Service &lt;cwslwr@igc.apc.org&gt; are spearheading the effort to keep cuts to this account under $1.5 billion. (2) The House of Representatives has passed H.R. 7, which includes an accounting measure effectively prohibiting most U.S. support for UN Peacekeeping, by counting bilateral costs of U.S. operations approved by the UN (such as the Persian Gulf, the bilateral intervention in Haiti) against U.S. assessed obligations. The Senate will soon take up a similar bill (S. 5). Even if, as some Republicans say, there are loopholes that would still allow some U.S. contributions, the result would be a further drastic reduction in UN peacekeeping capacity. The Council for a Livable World (Tel: 202-543-4100; Fax: 202-543-6297) and the Washington Office on Africa &lt;woa@igc.apc.org&gt; are two of the groups actively opposing S.5.  (3) Development assistance will continue under intense pressure to be cut drastically. With aid to Israel, Egypt, Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union enjoying greater political protection, Africa will be a particular target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senator McConnell and others are expected to continue their push to eliminate the Development Fund for Africa as an earmarked account, leaving priorities within bilateral assistance contingent on strategic significance and short-term economic prospects for U.S. business. Senator Helms is pressing a proposal to merge USAID, the African Development Foundation, and the InterAmerican Foundation into a new agency which would marginalise sustainable development as a goal and not fund government-to-government programs at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most Africa advocacy groups in the U.S. stress that they are not defenders of the USAID status quo. But they argue that drastic cuts and guidelines specifically excluding the goal of sustainable development will simply work to further marginalise Africa, and be used to justify cuts by other countries and international agencies as well. (Thus the Canadian International Development Agency has also announced cuts, aimed particularly at the strong NGO programs of development education in Canada.) Groups such as Bread for the World &lt;bfw@gmuvax.gmu.edu&gt;, the Washington Office on Africa, and African Americans for Aid to Africa (c/o Washington Office on Africa) have stressed that reform in the direction of sustainable development depends on clearly identifying the goals of promoting self-help development and poverty reduction, and preserving funding levels for the bilateral Development Fund for Africa at the 1995 figure of $802 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack on funding for international involvement, however, builds on extraordinary levels of public ignorance about the actual sums involved. A new poll on peacekeeping by the Center for the Study of Policy Attitudes, reported by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The New York Times, showed that a majority of 67% of the U.S. public still express strong support for UN peacekeeping in general (down from 84% a year ago). But when the respondents were asked to estimate what percentage of the U.S. budget goes for international peacekeeping, the median response was 22% (the actual figure is equivalent to less than 1% of the U.S. defense budget alone). They also thought on average that the U.S. provides about 40% of UN peacekeeping troops, ten times the actual percentage. (More details of the poll are expected to be available soon.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A poll earlier this year by the same agency (see summary below) showed parallel results on the issue of foreign aid. Such perceptions, combined with long-standing stereotypes of Africa as a hopeless and undifferentiated morass of violence and poverty, pose formidable obstacles to the many groups working to counter the drive to further marginalise Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attachment: Poll Reveals Contradictory Views on AID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new study of American public attitudes on foreign aid was recently conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes of the Center for International and Security Studies of the University of Maryland. It included a poll of 801 Americans conducted January 12-15 (margin of error plus or minus 3.5-4%), focus groups, interviews and a review of other polls. It found that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. An overwhelming majority of respondents (80%) embrace the principle that the United States should give some aid to help people in foreign countries who are in genuine need. Only 8% want to eliminate foreign aid entirely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. A strong majority (75%) says that the United States is spending too much on foreign aid. But this attitude is based on the assumption that the US is spending vastly more than it is, in fact. Asked to estimate how much of the federal budget goes to foreign aid, the median estimate of those responding was 15% -- 15 times actual spending (only about 1% of the budget).  (Other polls have found even higher estimates). Asked what an &quot;appropriate&quot; amount would be, the median level proposed was 5%. Asked how much would be too much, the median response was 13%, while 3% was seen as &quot;too little&quot; -- still 3 times present spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. When informed about the actual amount of spending on foreign aid, the number who felt that the amount was too much was 18% -- down from the 75% who had previously felt that the US was spending too much. When informed, a strong majority (62%) favored either maintaining or increasing foreign aid spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. The public wants to change the mix of priorities in foreign aid spending, putting less emphasis on securing US strategic allies and bases around the world and more emphasis on helping the poor and needy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Support for spending on poor countries stems partly from a belief that the world is so interconnected that it is in the economic interest of the US to promote the development of Third World countries (63% agree).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. Strong support also comes from the attitude that the US has a moral obligation to help nations in need (67% agree), while an overwhelming majority (77%) rejects the idea that the US should only give aid when it promotes the US national interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7. A strong majority (67%) supports the principle of giving aid to help countries move toward democracy, including former socialist countries, and 80% are unhappy about the amount of aid that goes to countries that are not democratic or have poor human rights records.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8. Eighty-three percent believe there is widespread waste and corruption in foreign aid programs. A strong majority (58%) would be willing to pay more in taxes if they believed that more aid would get to the people who really need it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9. To promote self-reliance, the majority (65%) is willing to spend more on aid that emphasizes trade and development and is willing to give poor countries preferential trade treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The study &quot;Americans and Foreign Aid: A Study of American Public Attitudes&quot;, was conducted by the Program on International Policy Attitudes, a program of the Center for the Study of Policy Attitudes and the University of Maryland Center for International and Security Studies.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NOW, HE IS AMONG 27 INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANISATIONS ELECTED TO THE UNITED NATIONS ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME (UNEP) GLOBAL 500 HONOUR ROLE FOR PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY WILL RECEIVE THE CITATION 5 JUNE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN A STATEMENT FROM ITS NAIROBI HEADQUARTERS, UNEP SAYS MONBIOT'S REPORTS HAS MADE MAJOR NEWS. HE HAS TRACED A CHIMPANZEE SMUGGLING NETWORK TO THE HEAD OF THE CUSTOMS DEPARTMENT OF COTE D'IVOIRE. HE HAS UNCOVERED A TIGER SKIN SMUGGLING NETWORK OPERATING BETWEEN INDONESIA AND SINGAPORE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE DENOUNCED THE ILLEGAL TRADE IN MAHOGANY BETWEEN BRAZIL AND GREAT BRITAIN, TRACING FELLING WITHIN INDIGENOUS FOREST RESERVES AND TO THE FURNITURE RESTORATION DEPARTMENT OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE, OFFICIAL RESIDENCE OF THE BRITISH CROWN.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WITH HIS BOOK AMAZON WATERSHED, HIS REPORT 'MAHOGANY IS MURDER' AND THE DOCUMENTARY FILM 'YOUR FURNITURE, THEIR LIVES', HE LAUNCHED AN INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE ILLEGAL MAHOGANY TRADE. THIS CRUSADE HAS NOW BEEN ADOPTED BY AT LEAST 120 ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, LEADING TO A 55 PER CENT REDUCTION OF MAHOGANY SALES IN GREAT BRITAIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ERIGNE SAMB, A FARMER IN THE SENEGALESE VILLAGE OF THIAMB'ENE, IS ON THE HONOUR ROLE. HE COMES FROM AN AREA WHICH HAS SEEN A DRASTIC REDUCTION IN TREE COVER DUE TO OVERGRAZING, SHITFING CULTIVATION AND TREE CUTTING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAMB RECOGNIZED THE NEGATIVE EFFECT THAT DEFORESTATION WAS HAVING ON HIS LIVESTOCK. SO, IN 1993 HE ESTABLISHED THE FIRST SYLVO-PASTORAL FIELD IN HIS VILLAGE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE FENCED IN 14 HECTARES OF HIS FARM USING VARIOUS CUTTINGS IN ORDER TO SAVE THIS AREA AS A FODDER RESERVE IN DROUGHT YEARS. THE NATURAL REGENERATION IN HIS FIELD DEVELOPED EXTREMELY WELL IN CONTRAST TO THE SURROUNDING BARREN LANDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFTER FOUR YEARS OF PROTECTION, THE NUMBER OF TREES PER HECTARE INCREASED FROM 10 TO 1,250. HIS FARM HAS BECOME A MODEL FOR SOIL CONSERVATION AND DEMONSTRATES WHAT INDIVIDUALS CAN DO, USING LOCALLY DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THROUGH THE ASSOCIATION WHICH HE FOUNDED, FATHER BALCMANS HAS SPENT A LIFETIME REACHING RURAL COMMUNITIES IN BURKINA FASO TO CARE FOR AND NURTURE THEIR ENVIRONMENT. FROM NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT TO SOUND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES AND RATIONAL BREEDING METHODS, SCORES OF VILLAGES HAVE LEARNED TO HELP THEMSELVES.</SPAN></P>

THEIR FIRST PROJECT AIMED AT UPLIFTING THE IMPOVERISHED AND INFORMED SETTLEMENTS IN AND AROUND THEIR DISTRICT. CLUB MEMBERS ORGANIZED WORKSHOPS FOR YOUTH ADDICTED TO NARCOTICS AND SET UP SOUP KICHENS FOR THE HUNGRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SINCE THE INFORMAL SETTLEMENT IS SITUATED AROUND A TRASH DUMP, A SYSTEM WAS SET IN MOTION TO EXCHANGE FOOD PACKETS FOR RECYCLABLE MATERIALS.  THIS NOT ONLY HELPED CLEAN UP THE AREAS, BUT ASSISTED THE COMMUNITY IN SUPPLEMENTING ITS INCOME.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE CLUB CREATED AN INDIGENOUS PARK IN THE GROUNDS OF THE SCHOOL AND SUPPLIED TREES TO OTHER SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. A THIRD PROJECT WAS A CAMPAIGN AGAINST WASTE, ENCOURAGING RECYCLING, WHICH WAS RUN CONCURRENTLY WITH A CAMPAIGN TO ENHANCE ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA, NIGERIA (PANA) - AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK PRESIDENT BABACAR NDIAYE, WHO WINDS UP HIS 10-YEAR TENURE ON THURSDAY, HAS COME OUT WITH TWO NEW BOOKS ROUNDING UP HIS 30 YEARS EXPERIENCE AT THE ABIDJAN-BASED BANK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE OF THE BOOKS ENTITLED +LA FOI DE BANQUIER. LA BAD D'HIER A DEMAIN+ (THE BANKER'S FAITH. THE ADB FROM PAST TO THE FUTURE) IS A 219-PAGE TREATISE WHICH RECOUNTS NDIAYE'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE BANK.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDIAYE IN THE BOOK PROVIDES A THINK-PIECE ON DEVELOPMENT AND HIS OWN VERSION OF THE DETERIORATION OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BANK BOARD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;AFRICA HAS TO BE HONEST WITH ITSELF IF IT IS TO DEVELOP,&quot; NDIAYE SAID IN THE BOOK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE OTHER, TITLED +LA BAD, L'AFRIQUE ET MOI+ (THE ADB, AFRICA AND I), IS A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS BETWEEN NDIAYE AND CAMEROONIAN JOURNALIST, HONORE DE SUMO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HERE, ONE OF ITS HIGHLIGHTS IS ON THE PSYCHOPHANCY COMMON IN AFRICA AND CITES A CONVERSATION WITH AN UNAMED TOP AFRICAN GOVERNEMENT OFFICIAL:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;YOU KNOW DEAR FRIEND, WE MUST TELL THE CHIEF WHAT HE WANTS TO HEAR.  IT IS THE SECRET OF LONGEVITY AND PROMOTION...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDIAYE POINTS TO SUCH ATTITUDES AS SYMPTOMATIC OF &quot;LA POLITIQUE DU VENTRE&quot; (THE POLITICS OF THE BELLY) WHICH HAVE MORTGAGED AFRICA TO THE SHOFT-TERM INTERESTS OF THE PRIVILEGED FEW.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHAT SHOULD BE IS THAT THE CHIEF MUST BE TOLD THE TRUTH IF AFRICA IS TO PROGRESS, HE SAYS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDIAYE HOLDS UP PRESIDENT JERRY RAWLINGS GHANA AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO REFORM AN ECONOMY WITHOUT LOSING POPULAR SUPPORTS. THE BOOK WAS APPARENTLY PRINTED BEFORE THE MASS STREET DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE WEST AFRICAN COUNTRY OVER A NEWLY INTRODUCED VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) EARLIER THIS MONTH WHICH PUT TO QUESTION THE ENTIRE BUSINESS OF ECONOMIC REFORM AND GHANAIAN WELFARE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IS YOUR GREY HAIR THE RESULT OF YOUR HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES&quot; TO THE CONTINENT AND &quot;HOW DO YOU PROMOTE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFRICA AT A TIME OF CONFLICT IN LIBERIA, ANGOLA, SUDAN, RWANDA AND SOMALIA ?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDIAYE RESPONDS TO SUCH QUESTIONS WITH THE SAME DIPLOMATIC DELIBERATION TO WHICH THOSE WHO HAVE ATTENDED HIS PRESS BRIEFINGS ARE FAMILAR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT WHILE THE BOOK THROWS SOME LIGHT ON NDIAYE AND THE ADB, THE READER IS NOT LIKELY TO FIND PROFOUND INSIGHT INTO THE PSYCHE OF THE MAN WHO HAS BEEN AT THE HELM OF THE INSTITUTION'S AFFAIRS OVER THE LAST DECADE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ONE WOULD ALSO HAVE LOVED TO READ HIS PREDICTIONS ON THE BANK'S FUTURE IN THE FACE OF THE CONTINENT'S GROWING MARGINALISATION AND EXTERME POVERTY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NONETHELESS, THE WORKS MARK A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO LITERATURE ON THE AFRICAN FINANCE SCENE.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BANK SENIOR RESIDENT ECONOMIST IN ZIMBABWE KAPIL KAPOOR TOLD DELEGATES AT A DAYLONG CONFERENCE ON THE WEATHER THAT DROUGHT THIS YEAR HAD CAUSED A 60-PER-CENT DROP -- TO 840,000 TONNES -- IN MAIZE OUTPUT. SUGAR PRODUCTION HAD DECLINED BY 27 PER CENT TO 380,000 TONNES.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COTTON EXPORTS WOULD ALSO BE LOWER AS PRODUCTION FELL FROM 181,000 TONNES IN 1994 TO SOME 110,000 TONNES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DUE TO THE DECLINE IN AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, BETWEEN ZD 630 MILLION (75 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) AND ZD 840 MILLION (100 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS) WOULD BE ADDED TO THE IMPORT BILL FOR THE IMPORTATION OF MAIZE, WHEAT AND COTTON.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE COMBINED IMPACT OF THE DECLINE IN EXPORTS AND THE INCREASE IN FOOD IMPORTS WAS EXPECTED TO COST THE COUNTRY ABOUT ZD 1.7 BILLION (200 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA, ZAMBIA (PANA) - ZAMBIA'S OPPOSITION +NATIONAL PARTY+ IS LOBBYING MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO BLOCK THE PROPOSED MERGER OF THE DEFUNCT MERIDIEN BANK BIAO WITH THE STATE-OWNED NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK (ZANACO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NP PRESIDENT HUMPHREY MULEMBA SAID IN LUSAKA MONDAY THAT HIS PARTY IS TOTALLY OPPOSED TO THE ENVISAGED AMALGAMATION AND CALLED FOR A PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE HOW MUCH STATE FUNDS HAD BEEN CHANNELLED TO THE CLOSED BANK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE ADVISED MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS WITH ZANACO TO FILE A COURT INJUCTION TO RESTRAIN GOVERNMENT FROM CARYING OUT THE PROPOSED MERGER, WHICH, HE CLAIMED, APPEARED TO BE MOTIVATED BY PERSONAL INTERESTS AMONG SOME ZAMBIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOME FINANCIAL ANALYSTS IN LUSAKA TUESDAY DESCRIBED THE INTENDED MERGER AS ILL-CONCEIVED AND NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE ZAMBIAN ECONOMY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOVERNMENT LAST FRIDAY PLACED THE CASH-STRAPPED MERIDIEN BANK UNDER RECEIVERSHIP AND ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD MERGE WITH ZANACO TO FORM A NEW BANK, THE ZAMBIA BANKING CORPORATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FINANCE MINISTER RONALD PENZA REVEALED IN LUSAKA MONDAY THAT GOVERNMENT HAD EARLY THIS YEAR SECRETLY PRINTED MONEY IN A FUTILE BID TO BAIL OUT THE ILL-FATED BANK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PENZA SAID GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED TO CLOSE MERIDIEN BANK AFTER THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND OPPOSED ITS DECISION TO BAIL IT OUT WITH STATE FUNDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE IMF IS SAID TO HAVE TOLD ZAMBIA THAT THE ACTION DISQUALIFIED THE COUNTRY FROM ACCESS TO ITS +ENHANCED STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT FACILITY+ (ESAF) ALLOWING MEMBER-COUNTRIES TO BORROW ON LONG-TERM AT CONCESSIONARY RATES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOVERNMENT LAST MARCH DE-LINKED MERIDIEN BIAO BANK FROM THE REST OF THE MERIDIEN GLOBAL NETWORK AND TOOK OVER ITS RUNNING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE BANK SUFFERED A MAJOR SETBACK IN FEBRUARY WHEN CLIENTS CLOSED THEIR ACCOUNTS AFTER HEARING OF ITS LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND IMPENDING CLOSURE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT INTERVENED AND BAILED OUT THE BANK BY PUMPING IN 8.4 BILLION KWACHA (1$ = 855 KWACHA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE BANK HAD 40,000 ACCOUNTS IN ZAMBIA AND WAS THE FOURTH LARGEST COMMERCIAL BANK IN THE COUNTRY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MERIDIEN BIAO INTERNATIONAL SHUT DOWN ITS HEAD OFFICE IN HAMBURG, GERMANY LAST JANUARY AND SCALED DOWN CORRESPONDENT BANKING SERVICES AT ITS LIASON OFFICES IN LONDON AND NEW YORK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE CENTRAL BANKS OF KENYA AND SWAZILAND HAVE TAKEN OVER THE BANK'S OPERATIONS TO RETAIN CONFIDENCE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZAMBIA'S MERIDIEN BANK DEPOSITS HAD DROPPED FROM ABOUT K70 BILLION TO BELOW K30 BILLION, A FIGURE BELOW ITS LIABILITIES.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALTHOUGH THE FINAL ENCOUNTER MAY BE DICEY AND THRILLING, THE EAGLETS' RECORD IN THE COMPETITION IS FRIGHTENING ENOUGH FOR THE UNBLEMISHED GHANAIANS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO SECURE A FINAL BERTH FOR THE WORLD JUNIOR SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIP IN ECUADOR, THE EAGLETS WON FOUR MATCHES SCORING 12 GOALS AND CONCEDED TWO.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOCCER PUNDITS SAY VICTORY COULD GO EITHER SIDE. BUT GHANAIAN COACH NURUDEEN JAWOLA HAS WARNED THAT HIS TEAM IS TECHNICALLY BETTER AND THAT OVER-CONFIDENCE COULD SCUTTLE THE NIGERIAN AMBITION TO TAKE THE TROPHY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE GHANAIANS, WHO WON THE GLOBAL COMPETITION IN ITALY IN 1991, WOULD CONFRONT THE EAGLETS WITH ALL WEAPONS IN THEIR SOCCER ARMOURY.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA, NIGERIA (PANA) - FOUR POWERFUL NON-REGIONAL MEMBERS OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ON FRIDAY SAID A THOROUGH AUDIT OF THE BANK'S FINANCES AND OPERATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT THIS YEAR TO EXPOSE CASES OF FRAUD AND CORRUPTION WHICH ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN AN INTERVIEW IN ABUJA WHERE THE ANNUAL ADB MEETINGS ARE BEING HELD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE BANK REPRESENTING BRITAIN, GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS, AND PORTUGAL, HANS SCHMID, SAID THE AUDIT WAS NECESSARY FOLLOWING NUMEROUS OTHER AUDIT REPORTS WHICH HAD REVEALED THAT FUNDS IN THE BANK HAD BEEN MISUSED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALREADY, FIVE SENIOR BANK OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN FIRED AND ANOTHER 100 OR MORE ARE EXPECTED TO LEAVE AS THE BANK WEEDS OFF STAFF IMPLICATED IN CORRUPT OR FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCHMID SAID THE BANK WOULD SOON ISSUE AN INTERNATIONAL TENDER INVITING REPUTABLE COMPANIES TO BID TO CARRY OUT THE AUDIT, WHICH WAS EXPECTED TO TAKE FOUR MONTHS FROM THE AWARD OF THE CONTRACT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;WE HAVE DECIDED TO COMMISSION AN AUDIT OF THE BANK IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE MISUSE AND ABUSE OF RESOURCES DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REPORTS THAT POINT TO CASES OF FRAUD AND CORRUPTION, MISMANAGEMENT AND ABUSE OF BANK RESOURCES,&quot; SAID SCHMID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THIS AUDIT IS PART OF THE CORRECTIVE MEASURES TO MAKE THIS BANK CLEAN AND LEANER AND DEFINITELY SOME HEADS WILL ROLL; ALREADY THEY HAVE STARTED TO ROLL,&quot; HE ADDED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MEANWHILE, HE DESCRIBED AS AN INSULT THE RECENT LETTER WRITTEN BY ADB PRESIDENT, BABACAR NDIAYE, IN WHICH HE WAS SAID TO HAVE CRITICISED THE BANK'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDIAYE ALLEGED THAT SOME DIRECTORS HAD &quot;TRANSFORMED THEIR OFFICES INTO PERSONAL FIEFDOMS WHOSE WEIGHT THEY BRING TO BEAR WITH CRUSHING WEIGHT ON ANY ATTEMPT TO CHECK THEIR EXCESSES.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE ACCUSATIONS WERE AN INSULT AND WE POINTED OUT IN OUR RESPONSE THAT THEY WERE UNNECESSARY AND WERE DESIGNED TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM NDIAYE'S OWN SHORTCOMINGS DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS,&quot; HE SAID.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HARARE, ZIMBABWE (PANA) - A LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANISATION, ZIMRIGHTS, HAS SAID ZIMBABWE'S JUST-ENDED PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS COULD NOT BE CALLED FREE AND FAIR BECAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ADVANTAGES THE RULING PARTY IN THE COUNTRY ENJOYS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT THE RULING PARTY ENJOYS ARE THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE SOCIAL WELFARE, COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPORT STRUCTURES OF THE STATE TO THEIR OWN POLITICAL GAIN AND A GOVERNMENT-SUPPLIED SUBSIDY OF ZIMDOLLARS 32 MILLION (USD 4 MILLION).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AT THE OFFICIAL LAUNCH OF THE ZIMRIGHTS ELECTIONS MONITORING REPORT ON FRIDAY, ITS CHAIRMAN REGINALD MATCHABA-HOVE SAID THERE WAS URGENT NEED FOR A REVIEW OF THE ZIMBABWE CONSTITUTION, PARTICULARLY THE ELECTORAL ACT.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MATCHABA-HOVE SAID GOVERNMENT SHOULD CALL FOR A NATIONAL CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE TO REVIEW THE ELECTORAL LAWS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WITH THE CURRENT ELECTORAL ACT, MATCHABA-HOVE SAID, ZIMBABWE STILL HAD A VERY LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE IT COULD CONSIDER ITSELF A FULLY-FLEDGED DEMOCRACY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AREAS NEEDING AMENDMENT INCLUDED THE PRESIDENT'S POWERS TO APPOINT THE ELECTORAL SUPERVISORY COMMISSION, DELIMITATION COMMISSION AND NON-CONSTITUENT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THERE ARE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTORAL PROCESS ITSELF AND THE SURROUNDING CONTEXT THAT PREVENT THE ELECTIONS FROM BEING CALLED SUBSTANTIALLY DEMOCRATIC: THE ELECTIONS WERE NEITHER FREE NOR FAIR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;FOR ITS PART, ZIMRIGHTS CAN ONLY DEMAND THAT THE CONSTITUTION BE REVISED IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND EARNESTLY ENTREAT THAT CONTINUAL PROGRESS TOWARDS A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM WILL NOT BE HINDERED BY ENTRENCHED POLITICIANS,&quot; MATCHABA- HOVE SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE MOST SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL DEFICIENCIES, IT SAID, AROSE FROM THE PRESIDENT'S POWER TO APPOINT MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE PRESIDENT HAS THE POWER TO APPOINT 12 NON-CONSTITUENT MPS AND EIGHT PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS WHO SIT IN PARLIAMENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ADDED TO THE 10 CHIEFS, WHO ARE ELECTED BY THE CHIEF'S COUNCIL BUT APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT, THE RULING PARTY WITH AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT NEED ONLY TO WIN 46 OF THE 120 SEATS TO OBTAIN PARLIAMENTARY CONTROL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ADVANTAGES MEAN THAT IN SOME CONSTITUENCIES THERE IS NO CHANCE OF THE RULING PARTY LOSING.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZANU PF WON 118 OF THE 120 CONTESTED SEATS DURING THE FOURTH LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS SINCE INDEPENDENCE IN 1980, HELD IN APRIL. THE OTHER TWO SEATS WERE WON BY ZANU (NDONGA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ZIMRIGHTS ALLEGES THAT THE DELIMITATION OF CONSTITUENCIES FOR ZIMBABWE'S 1995 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS IN SEVERAL CASES SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN DELIBERATELY CHOSEN TO WEAKEN OPPOSITION PARTY STRONGHOLDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IN ITS 1995 GENERAL ELECTIONS MONITORING REPORT, ZIMRIGHTS CITED BULAWAYO, ZIMBABWE'S SECOND CITY, AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE IT APPEARED THAT CONSTITUENCIES THAT WERE TRADITIONAL STRONGHOLDS OF THE OPPOSITION ZANU (NDONGA) HAD BEEN STRETCHED TO INCLUDE AREAS THAT TRADITIONALLY SUPPORTED THE RULING ZANU PF PARTY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ORGANISATION SAID THE DELIMITATION PROCESS FOR 1995 WAS ARBITRARY AND IRRATIONAL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE DELIMITATION COMMISSION'S DECISION ON THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CONSTITUENCIES WAS SUSPICIOUS, THE REPORT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE COMMISSION, LED BY JUDGE PRESIDENT JUSTICE WILSON SANDURA, WAS APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT AND HAS BEEN CRITICISED FOR BEING DOMINATED BY MEMBERS OF THE RULING PARTY.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE VANGUARD, A PRIVATE PAPER IN NIGERIA, RECOUNTED HOW MUCH THE COUNTRY HAD PAID IN THOUSANDS OF LIVES LOST AND FOUR BILLION U.S. DOLLARS SPENT TO HELP BRING PEACE TO LIBERIA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALTHOUGH IT WELCOMED THE SUMMIT, IT SAID, &quot;IT IS VERY SAD, HOWEVER, THAT SOME OF THE COUNTRIES THAT ARE OPENLY CLAMOURING FOR A RETURN TO PEACE TO LIBERIA HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE GIVING CLANDESTINE SUPPORT OF ALL FORMS TO SOME OF THE WARRING FACTIONS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KENYA'S OLDEST SELLING NEWSPAPER, THE EAST AFRICAN STANDARD, SAW &quot;A GLITTER OF HOPE&quot; FOR PEACE.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THIS IS BECAUSE THE MAIN FACTION LEADER, CHARLES TAYLOR, HAS SAID HE IS READY TO PARTICIPATE IN FRESH TALKS TO END THE FIVE-YEAR CONFLICT,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN OFFSHOOT OF LIBERIA'S TROUBLES IS SIERRA LEONE'S GUERRILLA WAR. THE SEMI-OFFICIAL 'DAILY TIMES' OF LAGOS SAID WHATEVER PROGRESS MADE IN LIBERIA &quot;MAY TURN OUT TO BE STILLBORN&quot;, UNLESS THE CRISIS IN NEIGHBOURING SIERRA LEONE IS ALSO RESOLVED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THE CONFLICT IS ALSO TRAGIC BECAUSE SIERRA LEONE, LIKE LIBERIA, IS A SYMBOL OF FREEDOM FOR AFRICAN PEOPLES,&quot; IT SAID, NOTING THAT BOTH WERE SETTLEMENTS FOR FREED SLAVES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT NOTED THAT NIGERIA AND GUINEA WERE PROVIDING MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO SIERRA LEONE. BUT FOR THESE EFFORTS TO YIELD THE PEACE DIVIDEND, IT SAID, CAPTAIN VALENTINE STRASSER'S ADMINISTRATION &quot;MAY HAVE TO DO MORE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> STRASSER'S NATIONAL PROVISIONAL RULING COUNCIL, IT SAID, SHOULD SEEK CONSENSUS WITH THE OPPOSITION FORCES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IN OUR VIEW, THE MOST RESPECTABLE WAY TO DO SO IS TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF MILITARY DISENGAGEMENT FROM POWER,&quot; IT SAID.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CONFLICT PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT ARE SOME OF THE NEW TASKS BEING UNDERTAKEN BY THE ORGANISATION OF AFRICAN UNITY, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN LESS VISIBLY ACTIVE IN SIERRA LEONE'S CASE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GHANA'S STATE-OWNED 'DAILY GRAPHIC' NEWSPAPER COMMENTED ON THE OAU'S 32ND ANNIVERSARY, ITS ACHIEVEMENTS AND FAILURES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT CHRONICLED THE END OF COLONIALISM AS ONE OF THE POSITIVE ACHIEVEMENT BUT ASKS: &quot;LOOKING AT THE CATALOGUE OF THE OVERALL PROBLEMS OF AFRICA, CAN'T IT BE SAFELY SAID THAT THE OAU HAS REMAINED A TALKING SHOP AND, THEREFORE, HAS NOT ACHIVED ANYTHING MUCH TO ITS EXISTENCE?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT CONTINUED &quot;AS WE CELEBRATE THIS ANNIVERSARY, IT IS IMPERATIVE FOR ALL MEMBER-STATES TO REDEDICATE THEMSELVES ANEW TO THE CAUSE OF INTEGRATING THE CONTINENT POLITICALLY, ECONOMICALLY AND SOCIALLY&quot; FOR THE BENEFIT OF ITS PEOPLE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;INFACT THE PRESSING NEED FOR AFRICA IS TO CARVE ITSELF A STRATEGIC ROLE IN THE NEW WORLD ORDER,&quot; IT ADDED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;AND TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE LOFTY IDEAS AND IDEALS, IT BEHOVES ALL AND SUNDRY TO REMEMBER THAT NOBODY CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE TO SHAPE OUR DESTINY AS AFRICANS EXCEPT AFRICANS THEMSELVES,&quot; IT CONCLUDED.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS POSITION WAS BACKED BY LUSAKA'S STATE-OWNED 'TIMES OF ZAMBIA' IN AN EDITORIAL DEVOTED TO THE OAU ANNIVERSSARY, WHICH FELL THURSDAY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IT VOICED THE OPINION THAT AFRICAN COUNTRIES COULD NOT BE REGARDED AS TOTALLY FREE AS LONG AS THEY PRETENDED TO BE IN CHARGE OF THEIR ECONOMIES, WHICH ARE INFACT RUN BY FOREIGNERS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;TOTAL FREEDOM FOR AFRICA IS CLEARLY VERY FAR AWAY AND WILL REMAIN SO AS LONG AS AFRICAN COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO BE SATISFIED WITH CLAIMING THAT THE REFORMS (ECONOMIC) ARE THEIR OWN WHEN IN FACT THEY ARE MADE ELSEWHERE,&quot; SAID THE DAILY IN AN EDITORIAL MARKING AFRICA FREEDOM DAY WHICH FELL THURSDAY.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;IN MOST OF AFRICA TODAY ANYTHING THAT WORKS IS DONOR-FUNDED. THERE IS VERY LITTLE INDIGENOUS INITIATIVE OR EFFORT,&quot; SAID THE TIMES.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA, NIGERIA (PANA) - THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB) FRIDAY REVERSED LAST NIGHT'S DECISION TO SUSPEND THE ELECTION OF THE INSTITUTION'S PRESIDENT FOR SIX MONTHS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> INSTEAD, THE BOARD ASKED THE BANK'S OUTGOING HEAD, BABACAR NDIAYE OF SENEGAL, TO STAY ON UNTIL THE HOLDING, IN AUGUST,OF FRESH ELECTIONS AT ITS HEADQUARTERS ABDIJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NDIAYE IS LEAVING THE INSTITUTION AFTER 10 YEARS AS ITS PRESIDENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS APPEARED TO BE THE COMPROMISE AFTER THURSDAY NIGHT'S FAILURE BY THE FIVE CANDIDATES FROM LESOTHO, MAURITANIA, MOROCCO, NIGERIA AND UGANDA TO COLLECT ENOUGH VOTES TO TAKE OVER THE BANK'S PRESIDENCY.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFTER FIVE ROUNDS OF POLLING, DELEGATES AT THE 31ST ANNUAL GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE ADB HAD DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE ELECTION OF THE INSTITUTION'S PRESIDENT FOR SIX MONTHS AND TO LOOK FOR WHICH AN INTERIM PRESIDENT WOULD MANAGE AFFAIRS AT THE ABIDJAN-BASED BANK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE DEADLOCK OCCURED AFTER THE FRONTRUNNERS, TIMOTHY THAHANE OF LESOTHO WHO LED THE POLLS THROUGHOUT AND HIS CLOSEST RIVAL, MOROCCO'S OMAR KABBAJ, FAILED TO SECURE THE REQUIRED VOTES TO WIN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE LAST ROUND SCORES WERE: THAHANE 44 PER CENT; KABBAJ 36 PER CENT WHILE THE NIGERIAN CANDIDATE, SEYYIED ABDULAI GOT 19 PER CENT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THAHANE'S LEAD WAS BASED ON SUPPORT FROM THE NON-REGIONAL MEMBERS.  KABBAJ CAME SECOND BUT DID NOT SECURE THE REQUIRED MAJORITY VOTES FROM THE AFRICAN MEMBERS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE FOURTH ROUND WITHDRAWAL OF MOHAMED LEKHAL OF MAURITANIA AND RICHARD KAIJUKA OF UGANDA AND THE THE RELEASE OF THEIR VOTES COULD NOT PRODUCE A CLEAR WINNER IN THE LAST BALLOT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO BECOME ADB PRESIDENT, AN ASPIRANT HAS TO SECURE A MAJORITY OF VOTES FROM ITS 51 AFRICAN MEMBERS AS WELL AS THOSE FROM THE 25 NON-REGIONALS, UNDER A SYSTEM OF WEIGHTED AVERAGES OF EACH COUNTRY'S SHARE IN THE BANK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIGERIA HAS THE LARGEST REGIONAL SHARE OF SOME 10.02 PER CENT AT THE BANK.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE NIGERIAN CANDIDATE PLACED THIRD BUT FAILED TO GET A SINGLE VOTE FROM THE NON-REGIONALS, A SLAP IN THE FACE FOR THE HOST MILITARY GOVERNMENT OF GEN.SANNI ABACHA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE THE BANK WITH A SUBSTANTIVE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AT A TIME THE CASH-STRAPPED BANK BADLY NEEDS ONE TO BOLSTER ITS INTERNATIONAL CREDIBILITY, COULD FURTHER AGGRAVATE THE INSTITUTION'S BAD FINANCIAL SITUATION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NIGERIAN OFFICIALS WERE GENERALLY NOT UNHAPPY WITH THE STALEMATE, CLAIMING IT THWARTED, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING, TO ATTEMPTS BY THE WESTERN POWERS TO HIJACK THE CONTINENTAL FINANCE INSTITUTION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;THIS HAS STOPPED THE NON-REGIONALS FROM STEALING THE BANK&quot;, ONE TOP NIGERIAN BANKER TOLD THIS CORRESPONDENT. (MORE)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANOTHER NIGERIAN DELEGATE SUGGESTED THAT SINCE THE US ALWAYS PROVIDES THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BANK AND JAPAN CHOOSES THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPER FOR A NIGERIAN TO HEAD THE ADB SINCE IT IS THE BIGGEST SHAREHOLDER.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BUT THE NON-REGIONAL MEMBERS WHO PROVIDE MOST OF THE BANK'S LOANABLE RESOURCES ARE NOT IMPRESSED BY THESE ARGUMENTS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THEY FEAR THAT A NIGERIAN PRESIDENT OF THE BANK WOULD COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ABACHA'S MILITARY GOVERNMENT AND THIS WOULD IMPACT NEGATIVELY ON ITS ABILITY TO MOBILISE RESOURCE FOR LENDING TO ITS AFRICAN MEMBERS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOME ANALYSTS HERE CONTEND THAT THE NON-REGIONALS USED THEIR LEVERAGE AT THE BANK TO PRESS DEMANDS ON THE NIGERIAN MILITARY TO RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC RULE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NONE OF THESE ARGUMENTS WILL HELP THE ADB, WHICH HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY STARVED OF NEW FUNDS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS BY NON-REGIONAL MEMBERS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BOTH THE ADB AND ITS SOFT LOAN AFFILIATE, THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FUND (ADF) ARE DUE FOR REPLENISHMENT BUT THE FOREIGN MEMBERS INSIST THERE HAS TO BE A THOROUGH HOUSE CLEANING OF THE BANK BEFORE THEY COULD PROVIDE NEW FUNDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THIS SHOULD HAVE BEGUN WITH THE ELECTION OF A NEW PRESIDENT TO OVERSEE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMPENDING REFORMS TO THE FULLEST.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THESE REFORMS WILL ONLY START TO BE PUT INTO PRACTICE AFTER AUGUST, IF A CONSENSUS CANDIDATE COMES UP TO BREAK THE DEADLOCK THAT EMERGED IN ABUJA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a very great honor, and we look forward to cooperation with this establishment here. Mr. Joe Dudley, who visited us in Zimbabwe a while ago, is a man of real determination who has done so much from such humble circumstances. We can benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In southern Africa, now that South Africa is a democracy, we are working to develop a community that will offer a vast market to the rest of the world, a region of some 100 million people, a supplier of commodities to other markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in order for us to be really viable, we need investments. And in Zimbabwe, we are putting in place a number of incentives to encourages enterprises to establish themselves and to encourage those already established to expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not long ago, we centrally regulated the economy. We inherited these central mechanisms, and we noticed that the controls tended to discourage the entrepreneur. We removed them and embarked on our economic structural adjustment progrma, called ESAP. We made it possible for companies to remit dividends, no holds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In regard to investors from then United States, we signed an OPIC agreement in 1990 that protects American companies. Heinz came into our company long ago. Coca Cola, Palmolive-Colgate and a host of other are doing well. And now Dudley will add its name. Let us see a black face that is successful! We are not chasing any whites away, but e are saying, let's be equal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for this opportunity. We have discovered your concern about us. We have discovered we are one.May that love, that concern, may that oneness continue to bind us in the future.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Third Presidential Forum on the Management of Science for Development in Africa is being held on the 24th and 25th July 1995 at the Uganda International Conference Centre in the Capital City of Kampala. The Meeting will be chaired by H.E. President Yoweri K. Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This Third Session of the Presidential Forum is being held after two other successful summits. RANDFORUM organized the First Presidential Forum on the on 31st October and 1st November 1993 in Gaborone, Botswana. The Forum was chaired by His Excellency Sir Ketumile Masire, President of the Republic of Botswana and Chairman of the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA); and was attended by Heads of State and Government (or their senior representatives), African Elders, Chief Executives of Africanwide, Regional and Multilateral Organizations, as well as about 300 leading representatives of the African scientific community, the major regional development agencies, and the private sector. This historic Meeting was dramatic evidence that there is growing and explicit commitment among African Leaders from all economic and development sectors that they are serious in adopting and operationalizing a</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> development paradigm based on S&amp;T for science-led and technology-driven development in Africa. In their Joint Communique, read by Dr. Kenneth Kaunda, former President of Zambia and an eminent African Elder, the Leaders stressed the importance of getting a cross-section of African Leaders sensitized to these issues and having them participate at the next Presidential Forum, to be held in 1994. Countries involved at this inaugural Forum included Botswana, Kenya, Mozambique, Uganda, Nigeria, Egypt, and Zimbabwe. This high-level Meeting was able to discuss and agree to commit itself fully to pursue S&amp;T as a major vehicle for social and economic advancement in Africa on a sustained basis. A major outcome of the First Presidential Forum was the agreement by the Heads of State to the creation of The African Foundation for Research and Development (AFRAND) as a major instrument for the mobilization of financial resources to fund demand-driven research that has direct application to development problems and to commercialization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Second Presidential Forum was held on 21st and 22nd July 1994 in Maputo, Mozambique, under the Chairmanship of His Excellency President Joaquim Alberto Chissano. The theme of the Conference was &quot;Mobilization of Africa's Development Oriented Scientific Talents and Management Skills.&quot; Sixteen African States were represented at the Heads of State level (10), or Prime Minister level (2), or Deputy Prime Minister level (1), and official Ministerial level (3). These comprised Mozambique (host/chairman), Botswana(the 1993 host/chairman), Angola, Congo, Gabon, Malawi, Mauritius, and Namibia; Senegal, South Africa, and Tanzania; Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Numerous multilateral and national development institutions attended, including the African Development Bank (ADB), Preferential Trade Area of Eastern and Southern Africa being turned into a Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (PTA/COMESA), African Regional Industrial Property Organization (ARIPO), United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), and the Association of African Universities (AAU). There were more than 400 participants. A significant proportion of the participants represented the private sector and community-level leadership. The Second Presidential Forum launched AFRAND on 22nd July 1994 after attaining 13 founding signatory member countries and 2 signatories from Africa-based multilateral institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Third Presidential Forum is devoting its time to discussing &quot;Strategic Framework for Food and Nutritional Security in Africa, 1995-2005&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is no doubt whatsoever that basic food and nutritional security has become the priority of priorities in Africa. It is not only a question of Africa's self-worth and political prudence. Food and nutritional security has become a major roadblock that must be completely cleared, in order to make way for other priorities essential for sustainable economic growth and social development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty years ago, Africa was self-sufficient in food, and was even a modest exporter of some food commodities, such as palm oil and groundnuts.  Two decades later, it had lost its capacity to feed itself; and by 1985, 22 countries in the continent had appealed to the international community for emergency food aid. In the Great African Famine of 1984-85, a record number of 1.0 million people died of hunger, malnutrition, and related diseases in the Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Niger, Chad, Mali, and Mozambique. Since then, recurrent drought, the debt crisis, and civil unrest have combined to further deepen the state of hunger and malnutrition in a large swath of the Sahelian and Sahelian like portions of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High rates of child and maternal malnutrition has worsened the famine pandemic, and has greatly diminished Africa's human capital. One-third of Africa's population takes energy below the minimum accepted per capita energy daily intake of 2300 kCal. The absolute number of under-nourished Africans has increased by 27% in the last 20 years, from 101 million people in 1969-71 to 168-300 million people in 1988-90. The result has been a greatly increased mortality rate among children under 5 years old, impaired physique in those who survive, and reduced intellectual development in later life. About 2.5 million out of 4.0 million African children who die before they reach age 5, suffer from malnutrition. There were more than 27 million children in 1990 who were underweight; this horrendous figure will increase to 36 million by the year 2005, if present trends continue. About 50-60% of pregnant women and pre-school children suffer from nutritional anaemia due to iron deficiency, seriously depressing the capacity to work; while many more suffer from malaria, leading to considerable loss of working days among the adult population, and to 1-2 million deaths a year among children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prevalence of malaria mosquitoes in the continent is ironic, since Africa is, in truth, grossly water-poor, except for the areas adjoining the Gulf of Guinea, the Congo Basin, and Madagascar. While water-rich countries, such as Sweden, have per capita availability of freshwater amounting to 22,110 cu.m. or more per year, water-poor African countries, such as South Africa, have per capita availability of freshwater of only 1,540 cu.m. per year, Kenya only 720 cu.m., and Libya a mere 190 cu.m. Indeed, no African country is regarded as water-rich, except Cameroon. Consequently, Africa, which needs irrigation most, has the lowest potential for it, except along the River Nile. Not only does it show unfavourable topography and unreliable rainfall, its water bodies contained in irrigation reservoirs and channels bear a tremendous load of water-borne diseases. Indeed, one may be forgiven if he concludes that, even if Africa is the second largest continent in the world, it is not particularly suited for agriculture: over 80% of its soils are poor and fragile, and 47% of the continent is too dry for rain-fed agriculture. Yet, 70-80% of its inhabitants depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. This is a challenge that African R&amp; D specialists and entrepreneurs cannot afford to pass over to others. The technological innovations, founded on several millenia of traditional knowledge base, that are required to enhance African agricultural productivity and to put production onto the path of intensification, in response to inherent soil fragility, unreliable rainfall, proness to frequent drought, and shrinking per capita availability of arable land, all demand total concentration. It is a priority that can no longer be set aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY IN FEEDING AFRICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than any other region of the world, food production South of the Sahara is in crisis. High rates of population growth and little application of improved production technology has resulted in declining per capita food production, escalating food deficits, and deteriorating nutritional levels, especially among the rural poor. Unless recent production trends are drastically altered, Africa will only be producing 75% of its food requirements by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the fundamental patterns of the African food crisis is the fact that there is no realistic vision and strategic policies to guide the agricultural sector. The African geopolitical leadership is presently working in a fragmented manner, and based on a fragile conceptual framework. Africa is predominantly an agrarian society. This can be exemplified by Kenya, which is one of the few African countries having a significant industrial sector.  Kenya has a total of 2.7 million small holdings, representing about 16 million persons (comprising about 64% of the entire population), 80% of whom own less than 2 hectares. Yet, these small holders account for 75% of the value of agricultural and livestock production, 55% of marketed output, and over 85% of agricultural employment. Therefore, whatever future scenario of science-led development is adopted, it must have small holder agricultural production and employment as a contemporary, integral part of that scenario.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African condition of extreme poverty, human diseases (malaria, river blindness, trypanosomiasis, guinea worm, schistosomiasis, etc), animal diseases, poor soils, uncertain rainfall, increasing population pressures, changing tenure and ownership patterns for land and cattle, agriculturalists, weaknesses in research and technology delivery systems, and political and social turmoil, all make the task of agricultural development extremely difficult. To a considerable extent, the present food crisis is the result of the long-term neglect of agriculture by political leaders both during the colonial and postindependence periods. Even though agriculture provides employment and the livelihood for 70-85% of the people in most African countries, rural and agricultural development have been given - and are still being given - low priority. Investments in primary education, agricultural research and extension education, input distribution and crop marketing systems, are woefully inadequate. Furthermore, many governments have pursued - and continue to pursue - cheap food policies to mollify the politically volatile urban dwellers at the expense of production incentives for farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impact that science-based agricultural development has had on the well-being of all humankind during this century has been enormous, although it has been partially masked by the rapid increase in human numbers. The benefits from the so-called Green Revolution in cereal production over the past three decades in many developing countries in the Asian and South American regions have been tremendous. It has not, however, solved the problem of chronic undernutrition and mulnutrition for hundreds of millions of lowincome, poverty-stricken people around the world, who are unable to purchase the food they need for adequate nutrition, despite the abundance of food in the world markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To reverse Africa's alarming food production trends, her small-scale farmers need access to science-based agricultural technology, just as similar farmers desperately needed it in Asia and South America three decades ago.  Even though most of the technological components that are required for a Green Revolution are already available, because of various constraints, e.g.  discriminatory economic policies, unavailability at the farmgate of seed of improved varieties and appropriate fertilizers, and inadequate transport, infrastructure, marketing and credit systems. It needs much more commitment and action for a similar revolution to occur in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are at least two key problems involved in feeding Africa's - indeed the world's - people. The first is the complex task of producing sufficient quantities and adequate nutritiousness of the desired foods to satisfy basic needs; and to accomplish this Herculean feat in environmentally and economically sustainable ways. The second task, equally or even more daunting, is to distribute food equitably. The impediment to equitable food distribution is poverty - lack of purchasing power - resulting from unemployment or underemployment, which, in turn, is made more severe by rapid population growth and shrinking arable land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ROUNDTABLE OF TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED ENTREPRENEURS IN AFRICA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Third Presidential Forum will be proceeded by the Inaugural Meeting establishing the Roundtable of Technology-Oriented Entrepreneurs in Africa on 22nd23rd July 1995 at the Uganda International Conference Centre.  This Roundtable will have the complex task of organically linking mission-oriented R&amp;D efforts to the resolution of the bottlenecks - whether they originate in production, processing, diversification, quality control, timeliness, sustainability, price competitiveness, or the use of natural or agroprocessing and food industries resources or other commodities as starting points - for manufacturing industries using new or upgraded technologies and enhanced management techniques to meet well-researched markets, whether, domestic, or intra-African, or foreign. This would be its first task, in conjunction with the Roundtable of Science Advisors and African Business Roundtable (ABR) in close conjunction to the African Development Banks, the financial sector as a whole, and venture capitalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Inaugural Meeting of the Core Group of the Roundtable of ScienceAdvisors for Science-Led Development in Africa that was established some three years ago, will be held on 23rd July 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the Third Presidential Forum the Republic of Uganda will exhibit its main achievements in the field of Science and Technology (S&amp;T) and its application in her economic and social development. The exhibition will involve the participation of the industry, R&amp;D institutions, NGOs and Corporations. These will feature industrial development and other major scientific and technological breakthrough in agriculture, mineral resources, environment, construction, telecommunication, electronics as well as other areas of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (UNCST), an institution mandated to oversee the integration of Science and Technology in the SocialEconomic development of Uganda, will have a central role in the staging of the Science and Technology Exhibition. Application of Science and Technology is effectively through the private sector and service institutions. Consequently, the Uganda Manufacturers' Association (UMA) the Northern Uganda Manufactures' Association (NUMA) and the Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA), will play a significant role in this S&amp;T exhibition. So will other service and research institutions based within Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Exhibition will be held at the UMA Showgrounds, Lugogo, Kampala from Sunday 23rd to Tuesday 25th July 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Nabusayi L. Wambokha</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though foreign investors get the red carpet treatment from Uganda's politicians, local companies and individuals beat them to the top of the investment honours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a just-released local and foreign investors survey done by the Uganda Investment Authority (UIA), &quot;most investors in Uganda re not foreign companies who have been promoted and (given incentives) to come to Uganda but individuals who are citizens, former citizens and residents and companies with previous close business connections to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There has been rare foreign investment with no previous connection to Uganda,&quot; the &quot;Survey of Licensed Investors-1994, which was conducted by Arnold F. Lessard, a Special Investment Policy Advisor with the UIA from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 405 companies surveyed between 1993 and 1994, 80 percent are under implementation, while 18 percent are inactive or abandoned. The report says the manufacturing sector, which includes large agro-processing, projects is the leading sector with 71 percent of actual investments, creating 28,118 new jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says Ugandan-controlled companies dominated the survey sample, with many of them sponsored and self-financed while the joint ventures accounted for 35 percent. The local funding sources exceed foreign sources, but foreign funding is growing rapidly; doubling between 1993 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey describes a typical investor in Uganda as &quot;currently or previously a resident of the country, has a Ugandan-controlled company, target the domestic market, is in the manufacturing sector and has an investment ranging between US $250,000 and 350,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UIA Operating Summary report for December 1994 and January 1995, for example, cites the case of six foreign investors coming into the country to explore investment opportunities but none was licensed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The six significant projects which were licensed were all locally owned including Naguru Medcal Laboratory LTD, East African Regional Airline LTD (Joint ownership), G.G. Powers LTD, Sports View Hotel Ltd., Universal matches Ltd., and the Voice of Toro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lessard survey says effective international investment promotion is an expensive undertaking which must be supported over a long period of time. It says the answer for this lies in more pro-active and vigorous international investment promotion of priority sector which have international comparative advantage and marketing such opportunities directly to potential foreign investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot; The days are over when Uganda can simply wait for foreign investors to present themselves at the doors of the UIA,&quot; the survey warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It however says aggressive promotional efforts in 1994 and 1995, many personally led by President Yoweri Museveni, are showing results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The investors are not without their problems. According to the survey, access to project and export finance and to serviced land are the major problems. It estimates that it will take several years to restructure, downsize, restrain and profitable turnround local banks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare -- When Zimbabwe's senior public prosecutor made it clear on Monday that the police had insufficient evidence to proceed with defamation charges against those at the helm of the contry's leading independent newspaper, and that arrests and charges were in any case inappropriate procedures in such a case, a telephone call from the attorney general's office soon put him straight. He was instructed to proceed anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Proprietor Elias Rusike (54), Financial Gazette executive editor Trevor Ncube (33), and deputy editor Simba Makunike (31) were charged with criminal defamation after their arrest and detention over the weekend. The charges followed a complaint from high court judge Paddington Garwe and Cabinet Minister Enos Chikowore about allegations in the newspaper that they had officiated at a state house wedding ceremony for President Robert Mugabe (72) and his former secretary, Grace Marufu (37). All concerned, including Mugabe, have denied that the ceremony took place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Legal sources reported that senior public prosecutor Duncan Dingana had ordered criminal charges to be dropped saying the allegations and evidence to date were &quot;not serious enough&quot; to warrant arrest and remand of the journalists. He was overruled by attorney general Patrick Chinamasa who sits in Mugabe's cabinet. Criminal defamation is a rarely- pressed charge that requires proof of &quot;potential disruption to the community&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prosecution has aroused widespread concern among Zimbabwe's nascent civil society who fears that following its crushing electoral victory, Mugabe's Zanu PF party, which is unashamedly hostile to pluralism and an independent press, will proceed to punish its most prominent critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mugabe has expressed his hostility towards the independent press on previous occasions, referring to it as &quot;the yellow press&quot;. He is said to have become enraged when Horizon magazine disclosed details of his present relationship with Marufu last month, even though it had been rumoured in Harare for two years. There has been no attempt to deny that customary marriage exchanges have taken place between the families or that two children have subsequently been born, Robert Junior (6) and Bona (5), named after Mugabe's late mother. Marufu's first husband, an airforce officer, is reportedly claiming that Robert is his son. He has been posted abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources in Zimbabwe's diplomatic community suggest that leaks about the couple have emanated from powerful political figures in the ruling party who fear that the emergence of a Mugabe dynasty may one day eclipse their chances of preferment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The state media, which has remained obediently silent about the President's marriage until the recent disclosures, last week suggested that Mugabe might consider action in the civil courts against those seeking to &quot;damage his reputation&quot; ahead of next year's presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Althought official newspapers have been quick to suggest that the President's office has nothing to do with the current prosecution, it is difficult to conceive of such high-level action without Mugabe's knowledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The well-organised swoop in which a team of over 16 police officers took part betrays a politcial hand, editor Ncube believes. &quot;This is an unambiguous attempt at intimidation,&quot; he said, adding that police interrogation focused on his sources in the wedding story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three journalists were picked up on Saturday morning and taken by detectives to their offices which were searched. No arrest or search warrants were produced, they said. Defence advocate Erik Morris claimed after Monday's hearing the timing of the arrests was clearly designed to maximise the period of detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems to be a return to the glorious old Rhodesian Front days,&quot; Morris said, referring to the white monority regime of Ian Smith before 1980.  &quot;That is what used to happen then.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Students held placards outside the courtroom saying &quot;Smith's laws again&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Financial Gazette has been responsible for a series of disclosures highlighting official corruption, the most recent case involving a cellular phone contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace representative Mike Auret said the arrests were reminiscent of the Smith era and designed to &quot;instill fear in the local media&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Mugabe is in the United States this week working up investment for Zimbabwe. Commentators note his case for investing in a democratic Zimbabwe will now look threadbare. And stories about his private life are not likely to go away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Federation of Journalists on Wednesday urged Mugabe &quot;to take steps immediately to reassure the international community that Zimbabwe remains steadfast in its commitment to press freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justice Garwe presided over the trial of anaesthetist Richard McGown last year. On that occasion he declined to institute proceedings against a ruling party newspaper that gave prominence to calls for the &quot;amputation of white limbs&quot; if McGown was not found guilty. In the same case, Attorney-General Chinamasa said in response to defence pleas for action against those inciting violence and contempt of court: &quot;That is the price you pay for a free press.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SEVERAL top figures in Namibian politics, including two cabinet ministers and the Southern African Development Community (SADC ) executive secretary, have been accused of misusing drought relief aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Namibian Cabinet in early May refused to release the report of an investigation into the abuse of funds while 'clearing' all top officials involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the centre of the storm are SADC Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende, Minister of Justice Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, Minister of Prisons Marco Hausiku, Deputy Minister of the Environment Nangolo Ithete, Deputy Minister of Finance Rick Kukuri, and Governor of the Okavango region, Ambrosius Haingura. All are accused of using drought aid money to drill boreholes on their private farms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'borehole scandal' is being seen by observers as a test of the Namibian government's real commitment to transparency and accountability following Swapo's landslide majority in last December's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The allegations go back to the severe drought of 1992 in Namibia. In early 1993 the Namibian media revealed that Tjiriange and then Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Ithete, had arranged for two boreholes to be drilled on their jointly owned farm at a cost of almost N$200 000 during the 1992 drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob subsequently appointed a commission to be chaired by the head of Namibia's public service body, Willie Brits, to investigate the media claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It soon became clear to the officials involved in the Brits investigation that other top figures, besides Tjiriange and Ithete, were involved in the aid abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Brits Commission finished its work in mid-1994, but the Cabinet decided to appoint a new ad hoc committee of three ministers to hear the explanations of those political figures and officials named in the Brits report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three weeks ago Minister of Information Ben Amathila announced that all those implicated in the 'borehole scandal' had been cleared by the Cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time Amathila released limited information about the investigation which made it clear that at least six top figures in Swapo had gained boreholes as individuals for their personal farms, expressly defying the directive that drought aid was for needy rural communities only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amathila said the Cabinet had decided to clear the officials because at the time they applied for aid there were no proper administration procedures in place and because the boreholes in question were now, three years later, accessible to rural communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the Cabinet decision to exonerate the officials, it has since emerged that the Brits report found them guilty and recommended that they at least pay back the cost of the boreholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The opposition DTA have called the government's actions &quot;a total cover up&quot; and joined calls for the release of the Brits report and the subsequent findings of the ad hoc cabinet committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Questions are now being asked about the private farms occupied by the top officials.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- A YEAR to the day after Joe Slovo first walked into the Ministry of Housing to give it the shake-up of its life, his successor, Sankie Mthembi-Nkondo, could this week announce a June 5 start for government's mass housing programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unveiling new subsidy and loan and savings schemes, giving people earning R3 500 and less a foothold, and plans for housing support centres offering advice and cheap building materials, Nkondo paid tribute to the man whose first act as housing minister was to tell his director-general he wanted him to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nkondo's deputy director-general, Neville Karsten, remembers the day well -- he and his colleagues were reeling with shock at the announcement that &quot;a communist, someone seen as Public Enemy Number One&quot;, was taking over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One expected to meet an ogre, yet found a quiet, gentlemanly person who was very forthright, knew exactly where he was going and what he wanted to do and who spelled out his policies in such a way that one could completely identify with him,&quot; Karsten said this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of all the ministries, housing has perhaps had the smoothest transition. One reason for this is the work that preceded the April 27 elections -- painstaking and often painful consultations with stakeholders brought together in the National Housing Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slovo's arrival aroused fears that the work done in devising a housing policy based on free-market principles would be washed away by command economy enthusiasms -- but he quickly allayed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Said Karsten: &quot;He accepted the work that had already been done, so we could build on it. We had a broad framework in place but at that stage it was a very shaky skeleton -- we had to clothe it in flesh. We had a good basis on which to start -- all we needed was the strategic thinking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Slovo gave it. His incumbent director general, Louis Koch, took early retirement and former National Housing Forum powerhouse Billy Cobbett came in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The same day, Joe addressed the entire department. He told us what had happened and spoke about the need to work together. In this way, he was able to cement relations between the old officials and the new,&quot; Karsten said. &quot;Without him, we would not be where we are today.&quot; And without the pre-election years of negotiations with the National Housing Forum, the new ministry may well have found itself obstructed, sabotaged or generally debilitated by foot-dragging old-guard bureaucrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refining the &quot;shaky skeleton&quot; of a legal, institutional and financial framework to get delivery going was the first priority of the new ministry.  It meant the actual rate of delivery dropping to historic lows while all the pieces were put into place -- but also means a new policy that is sustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From June 5, Nkondo announced this week, banks will start lending to individuals earning less than R3 500 in terms of the record of understanding forged with government last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consolidation subsidies, for people who have already had state assistance in the form of a serviced site, will be available for building &quot;small but solid&quot; structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a new system of institutional subsidies will be introduced, allowing people to form housing co-operatives and associations -- and opening the way for cheap rental accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bank loans will be offered across the country, but only where cover is available in terms of the Mortgage Indemnity Scheme (MIS) -- in other words, areas where due process of law can be applied. Loans will be granted on a strictly commercial basis, and could be as small as R10 000, repayable over 20 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those unable to afford the five percent deposit will be able to save money towards it over a minimum of nine months -- and there will be subsidies to match the deposit they have saved for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To meet the ministry's part of its bargain with the banks - - it undertook to solve the problem of houses formally repossessed, but which lending agencies cannot get access to -- Nkondo announced the creation of Servcon Housing Solutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A joint venture by the department of housing and lenders, it will offer people living in the estimated 30 000 repossessed but still occupied homes a chance to reschedule their loans and resume payment or -- if this is unaffordable -- help find cheaper accommodation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Nkondo warned that although housing got the largest budget increase of any department, it was still &quot;nowhere near large enough to satisfy demand all at once&quot;, while the backlog would take years to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communities across the country should accept that &quot;nothing will move, nothing, if we do not take responsibility for ourselves&quot; by paying for housing and services, and the repair and protection of community assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is what Masakhane is all about,&quot; she said. &quot;A strategic alliance where government, the private sector and individuals within their communities pool resources to transform and uplift South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was an unfortunate fact of life that most South Africans -- those sidelined in the past by both government and the private sector -- would never be able to afford housing on credit. But they are the focal point of the new policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Let us be quite frank. The maximum subsidy of R15 000 will seldom, if ever, buy outright the kind of house people imagine when they turn to daydreaming. But it will do something South Africa has never seen before. It will provide the poorest people in our country with a tangible and workable housing opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It will provide them with security, services and a structure. It will give them water, waste water disposal, solid walls and a roof ... It is our task to ensure that people who have little to add to the subsidy can maximise the advantages to be gained from what little they have -- whether it be their own labour, minimal savings or other skills.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Housing support centres would be set up in each province to provide, over time, advice, finance, training, jobs and cheaper building materials to the poorest of the poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ultimately, said Nkondo, only South Africa's people could decide &quot;whether we are to get to work building or not&quot; -- by organising within their communities and paying for housing and services, &quot;because a rand withheld is one rand less for new housing or upgraded services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joe Slovo would have been proud of her.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Anton Harber (Commentary)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail and Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- A great deal has been written about the virtues of our Government of National Unity (GNU). Not a lot has been said about its limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the heady days of the elections, when it would have been bad faith to question the institutions on which peace depended, everybody was quick to praise the compromises involved in the GNU and brush aside any problems it might create.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, with a government which often hesitates to make up its collective mind, there is no need for such reticence. One can see the severe limitations this unusual form of government imposes on the process of political change.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The GNU is government by committee. Worse, it is a government of committees made up of people who dislike and distrust each other -- hardly a recipe for effective leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider the Department of Social Welfare. In the horse- trading of Cabinet posts, Social Welfare got the short edge of the wedge, in the form of minister Abe Williams. Notoriously second-rate as an administrator, he got the post because the NP was entitled to five Cabinet posts and wanted at least one to go to one of those black Nats who had served the party so loyally when it was still oppressing blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela's hands are tied. The principles of the GNU make it well-nigh impossible to fire a minister for incompetence alone. The minister would need to do something considered really serious, like criticise the GNU, to be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider also the issue of abortion. A litmus test for government social policy, it has gone to a multiparty committee, which is going to struggle to find a workable compromise, a process that will take at least two years. Just starting public hearings on the issue has taken a year. And that's before the issue is tested before the Constitutional Court, as is inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ANC came to government with an unequivocal pro- choice position on abortion. Since compromise seems unlikely on so touchy an issue, the ANC may have to await the end of the GNU to implement its policy, while tens of thousands of women every year suffer the consequences of back-street abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consider the all-important mining industry. Last week's horrific accident highlighted the need for firm government action to improve safety conditions. But this is going to be bedevilled by a battle between the ministry, led by the redoubtable Pik Botha, and the parliamentary committee, led by fomer unionist Marcel Golding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Botha is the minister not because Mandela chose the best person for the job, or one who had special knowledge or concern for the industry.  Mandela had to find a post for Botha, and one in which he could not do too much harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Choosing a Cabinet this way is unlikely to produce effective leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ethos of the GNU even infects those parastatal bodies set up in the spirit of national unity. The make-up of the SABC board was a careful balancing act in which competence and suitability came second to finding a workable political compromise. The results of this can now be seen in the lack of a coherent vision for the national broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Independent Broadcasting Authority, the compromise was so complicated that it ended up with a co- chairpersonship -- guaranteed to prevent speedy and effective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The root cause of all this paralysis is that the GNU enforces compromise, not just where it is a political necessity, but even when the situation demands firmness and decisiveness. The GNU empowers minorities beyond their numbers, and often blocks the ability of a majority to implement its policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This may put a valuable brake on the majority exercising power without restraint. But it can also prevent a government from giving clear leadership when it is demanded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead of a Cabinet that can give clear decisions, Mandela leads an executive that is a battleground for power among three participating parties.  These parties now hold caucuses before Cabinet meetings, to ensure that they do not argue among themselves in front of other party leaders -- a situation that militates against coherent Cabinet decision-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any country, democracy often compromises effective government. The need to be transparent, accountable and keep an eye on the electorate with a view to the next election often militates against firm leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These costs are multiplied in a government of national unity. The government does not only have to deal with opposition in Parliament, but in its own institutions -- in the cabinet, the public service commission ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, there is no traditional parliamentary opposition.  The strongest opposition parties, who would normally be vocal and active watchdogs in parliament and its committees, have their hands tied by cabinet loyalty. Almost always, if the government makes a poor decision, they have been party to it and are limited in their criticism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One must recognise the contribution the GNU has made to a peaceful transition. But it is a tool with a specific purpose -- and once that purpose has been achieved, it is no longer useful.That time is rapidly approaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This country needs a government able to take firm and decisive action when it is called for -- and an opposition that is able to keep a close watch on it and speak out strongly against poor decisions. That cannot happen within the GNU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One expects the National Party to fight against the dissolution of the GNU, for this strange arrangement is the only way the Nat leadership can hold on to cabinet perks. But the rest of us should eagerly await the demise of this form of government and the emergence of normal democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the president can choose the best available people for his cabinet and may well choose some from outside his party. He may still opt for a cabinet of national unity, but it will be voluntary -- and much more effective.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Eddie Koch</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- BLAST, lash, haul and crush. The words that describe the essential stages of gold production on South African mines are drawn from the imagery of battle. When Sotho miners go underground to do these tasks, they sometimes sing a song with a chorus line that says liphoro tsa mali, liphoro -- floods of blood, floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Vaal Reefs disaster and the publication this week of a new report on health and safety in South Africa's mines are grim reminders of the truth of this mineworkers' lexicon. Each of the 600-odd tons of gold they produce a year costs, on average, one corpse and 12 seriously injured men.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report from a commission of inquiry into health on the mines, chaired by Justice Ramon Leon, says more than 69 000 miners have been killed and more than a million seriously injured in the first 93 years of this century. In the last ten years, the average annual number of deaths on all mines was 680.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Leon's inquiry, the most extensive ever conducted on health and safety on the mines, was released on Monday. Its hard-hitting findings have been welcomed by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which represents most black mineworkers, and also the mainly white Mine Workers' Union. The commission's report, and its far-reaching proposals, are likely to have a revolutionary impact on the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At current accident levels it is estimated that a worker who spends 20 years underground faces a one in 30 chance of being injured or killed on gold mines. In 1993, 578 mineworkers died in accidents -- more than one per 1 000 of the workforce. In the same year, 8 532 mineworkers were seriously injured, that is more than 15 per 1 000,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On top of this come the dangers of contracting fatal lung diseases.  The report notes 4 000 miners develop tuberculosis every year and quotes a survey from the 1930s that indicates 60 percent of these people may die in two years. &quot;An 18-year-old man who starts a career in mining at the stope face will have a one in two to one in three chance of being disabled from accident or disease,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Tuberculosis rates were about 58 per thousand after 15 years of exposure. After 10 years' exposure, between 40 and 80 percent of workers involved in drilling operations would have hearing problems ... A study of shaft sinkers, developers, stopers and shift bosses had shown that if a man were to work 8 000 shifts, the probability of developing silicosis was over 30 percent.&quot; Silicosis can develop into a fatal form of lung fibrosis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics obtained from the International Labour Organisation, and published in the report, suggest South African mines have among the highest global fatality rates -- and the worst safety conditions in the developed world. Only Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Papua New Guinea and Pakistan appear to have worse rates. &quot;Unquestionably, a similar number of deaths and serious injuries would be unacceptable today in most advanced mining countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report says there is a combination of three geographic features which make mining in South Africa such a deadly industry: great mining depth, brittle and abrasive rocks, and the often narrow width of the ore-bearing rock underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African gold mines are the deepest in the world -- some reach depths of 3km, where the pressure is the same as that of a submarine 8km under water -- and their subterranean shafts are subject to sudden and unpredictable rockbursts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Frequent, sudden rock failures, as with underground explosions, are the most insidious hazards that miners have to face. There is an obvious correlation between the great depth of mining and the shockingly high accident rate in gold mines.&quot; Six out of every 10 deaths underground are caused by rockbursts and rock falls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem of rock fractures is compounded by the hard and brittle nature of the quartzite that surrounds gold-bearing ore. This kind of ground demands that heavy explosives be used in mining operations and contributes greatly to the violent nature of underground seismic shocks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The extremely narrow gold-bearing reefs compound the problem. Shafts that lead to the rockface are extremely narrow, sometimes less than a metre high, making it impossible to use machines that have helped make mining safer in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The low grade nature of the ore often requires that massive amounts of rock need to blasted and hauled to the surface. In order to produce an average of 600 tons of gold each year, an underground reef covering between 20 and 30 square kilometres has to be physically moved from under the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Each mine is forced to maintain excessively long stope faces, and long, often tortuous, communication lines. It is difficult to control, supervise and inspect such widespread operations. In short, men working in such mines tend to be in a perilous situation.&quot; And the report notes that mines are going deeper into the earth every year -- without having devised measures that are capable of effectively predicting and preventing rockbursts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the notice board of the Vaal Reefs Gold Mine, there is a yellowing piece of paper which highlights another feature of death underground, one that tends to be obscured by the dramatic and grisly nature of big disasters like that which happened last week. The note says: &quot;On 17 June 1994, the deceased (a development team leader) was operating a mechanical loader. The loader tilted and pinned him against the wall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are everyday events on the mines and they account for by far the greatest number of deaths. Most fatal accidents involve less than 10 workers.  They go unreported in the media. Many do not even make a mention on the mine's notice board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Disasters only account for between five and 15 percent of annual deaths, says sociologist Jean Leger in a recent edition of Labour, Capital and Society. &quot;They are merely the tip of the iceberg, grim punctuations of the on-going accident toll on South African mines&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 'The status quo cannot continue'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All indications are that the history of death on the mines will refer to the times before and after this month's disaster at Gold Reefs. The 104 men plunged to their deaths at a time when a number of factors have coalesced to place the industry under unprecedented pressure to clean up its act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a macabre irony that the disaster happened just days before the Leon Commission's report was to be published and it will now add urgency to sweeping changes suggested in the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The status quo cannot continue,&quot; wrote the judge. &quot;The claim of special difficulties, which undoubtedly exist in some instances (in mining), does not absolve the boards of companies, the shareholders and the management from the responsibility of caring, and the need to make a special effort to overcome these problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission recommends that a new Health and Safety Act be drafted as a matter of urgency. And, in a break from previous traditions, it stresses this should be done in a spirit of &quot;tripartism&quot; by a committee consisting of representatives from the state, industry and the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also suggest that comprehensive codes of practice, a blueprint for safety on each individual mine, should be drafted as part of the new legal framework. Judge Leon urges that high-powered tripartite committees with wide powers to advise the state, commission and facilitate research into health and safety and to promote improved training in the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His report endorses long-held union demands that health and safety officials be elected at every mine and that every mine should have a joint health and safety committee to discuss policy regarding prevention of disease and accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The commission also accepts that any worker has the right to &quot;withdraw his labour and remove himself from any place where there is reasonable cause to think that his health and safety is in danger&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says a new law and a system to implement these changes should be negotiated voluntarily by management and organised labour before being submitted for ratification to parliament -- which is where the industry will find a second sea-change in conditions that affect its operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike its predecessor, this parliament is now made up of numerous men and women who have a background in struggles for improved worker rights, especially on the mines. This shift in the class make-up of the state was symbolised when President Nelson Mandela and a high-powered coterie of cabinet ministers and political heavyweights gathered under a patch of bluegum trees to address 5000 workers at Vaal Reefs and pay tribute to their fallen colleagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At his side was Cyril Ramaphosa, chair of the Constitutional Assembly and general secretary of the African National Congress; Tito Mboweni, minister of labour; Cheryl Carolus, assistant general secretary of the ANC; Charles Ngqakula, general secretary of the Communist Party; James Motlatsi, president of the NUM; and Clem Sunter, executive director of Anglo American's Gold and Uranium Division, who looked decidedly out of place in this company of labour stalwarts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela, himself an honorary president of the NUM, could have been speaking to Sunter when he told the rally, to great applause: &quot;There is a widespread perception among Africans, Indians and coloureds that whites do not care very much about the lives of black people in this country. That I may not believe that perception myself is not relevant ... it is only going to be reviewed by what the country as a whole, including the white minority, do on this occasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- South Africa's constitution-makers have hitched a ride on the information superhighway. This week, a large database of information relating to the deliberations of the Constitional Assembly was established on the Internet, the global electronic network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The service will contribute to making the process of writing South Africa's constitution &quot;the most open and transparent in the history of democracy,&quot; says Constitutional Assembly executive director Hassen Ebrahim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not only are all official documents relating to the new constitution now available on-line, but so too are the multitude of submisions made by members of the public. The database is searchable, using either topics or key words, making it easy to find information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the public can also e-mail their submissions on constitutional matters directly to the Constitutional Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mail &amp; Guardian tested the site this week. We found several thousand documents already archived. A search using the key word &quot;abortion&quot;, for example, threw up over 260 relevant documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the first real effort by government to provide free on-line information. In the USA, Canada and Europe, considerable success and cost-savings have been achieved by governments using electronic networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UK government recently announced it had saved thousands of pounds in printing costs by putting the Budget on the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently, the South African Government Gazette was launched on-line, but this is a commercial service that has to be paid for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitutional Assembly Internet project is being co- ordinated by Julien Hofman of the University of Cape Town law faculty. &quot;The project is very important to the assembly,&quot; says Hofman. &quot;The word transparency is always cropping up. Now anyone with Internet access will be able to get to any document on the database -- whether it is the minutes of a committee meeting, a submission, a report ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UCT law students are being employed part-time to capture the documents on to the database. Apart from the work of the theme committees and other official Constitutional Assembly documents, over 3 000 submissions from the public have been scanned in so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The project was given a kick start through the donation of a powerful Sun computer server by Vector Network Computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The significance of the project, says Hofman, stretches beyond the immediate concerns of the Constitutional Assembly. &quot;This is a foretaste of what will happen in the future ... this will be a model for enabling a much greater proportion of the population to become involved in the business of government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hofman hopes to see the service extended to provide greater public access through the installation of computers in post offices and libraries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Ordinary people will then be able to find out easily what is actually happening in government. More than this, they will be able to respond and make their views known to their representatives and the various authorities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitutional Assembly database is housed on a World Wide Web (WWW) site accessible at http://www.constitution.org.za</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Submissions to the Constitutional Assembly can be e-mailed to conassem@access.org.za</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Mark Gevisser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- Why, I asked Minister of Justice Dullah Omar, did he think that, of all the issues before our first Government of National Unity, the one that nearly brought the whole damn house tumbling down was his Truth and Reconciliation Bill?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All of us involved in this bill,&quot; he replied with those sad, Basset eyes so perfectly suited to truth and reconciliation, &quot;are forced to look at ourselves, to see whether we, personally, are living up to the standards we hope to set in the legislation. It is a painful process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paraphrase: it's not just about politics; it's about Freud and Christ, about repressed memory, confession and redemption. It's about needing to deal, or not being able to deal, with the past. Those legendary 300 hours the Select Committee on Justice sat were not simply about horse trading -- they were an intense course of psychoanalysis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once the Truth Commission is up and running, Omar hopes it will trigger &quot;a time of national soul searching&quot;. It's going to be a tough time, particularly for white men. White people, and specifically white men, have perhaps a far more complex and ambivalent relationship -- and thus, perhaps, more of an attraction or repulsion -- to the memory of this country's history. Here, then, are four white men, intimately involved in the process, talking about truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Father Michael Lapsley</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exactly two months after Nelson Mandela was released, Father Michael Lapsley, a New Zealand-born Anglican priest with the African National Congress in Harare, received a letter, on ANC stationery, telling him to expect books from South Africa. A few days later, two parcels arrived. The first contained a religious book, the second a bomb which blinded him in one eye, blew one of his hands off, and left the other severely mangled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Australia, as part of pre-operative counselling before his second hand was amputated, he was seen by a psychologist. She turned out to be a white South African. &quot;Suddenly,&quot; recalls Lapsley, &quot;there was this fascinating role-reversal; now she was the client and I the father- confessor. She experienced some sense of collective responsibility, a sense in which she saw herself as an indirect party to the bombing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lapsley now works as the chaplain for the deliberately uneuphemistically named Trauma Centre for the Victims of Violence and Torture. He is appalled at the lack of contrition among those who were in power when he lost his hands. Unlike that psychologist, they, &quot;the perpetrators, have the audacity to tell the victims, 'it is your job to forgive and forget,' while at the same time refusing to acknowledge that they have been party to evil&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Just by existing,&quot; he says, waving about the metal pincers that have replaced his hands, &quot;I am a problem to the forgive-and-forget crowd. Priest, white, no hands. If I'm dead there's not a problem, you can deny it all; bury the evidence. But I'm living, I'm a big problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And he intends to remain one. He is already unhappy that we have only a Truth and Reconciliation Commission rather than a &quot;Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. No trials mean no justice. Personally, I would say it would be better if we had trials and then amnesty. You'd have the truth, and then you'd say, well justice is that you are sentenced for 10 or 20 years, but in the interests of reconciliation we'll give you amnesty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His is the language of confession, absolution and redemption, &quot;of bringing good out of evil, life out of death&quot;. He is irritated with &quot;cheap reconciliation&quot;. In the New Testament, he says, &quot;the Greek word for forgiveness is the same as that for untying a knot&quot;. Both involve hard work, particularly if you have no hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danie Schutte</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When, asks Danie Schutte exasperatedly, &quot;are we going to be done with all this recrimination? For how long are we going to hear that we did this and that and the other?&quot; It has poisoned even his own family. He has two kids at university and two in high school: &quot;I've been confronted by three of my kids with the accusation, 'Why was apartheid there? I'm waiting for the fourth one to come with the same recrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How does the National Party's Justice Committee leader answer his own children? Exactly as he does his political opponents: &quot;I was not the architect of this system. I got it. Basically, we are the ones who dismantled it, who moved away from it.&quot; No guilt, no responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has been in parliament, on and off, since 1977, when he was elected MP for Pietermaritzburg North. Has he ever had a personal moment of reconciliation? He is hard-pressed to think of one. &quot;I have never been a racist. If anyone can argue with me and tell me I was one, I'd like to know on what grounds ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If anyone is personally responsible for the the hundreds of hours of deliberation in the Justice Committee, it is Danie Schutte. He is perhaps the most belligerent of the NP backbenchers, and has made a name for himself, this first year, as one of the party's fiercest opponents of the ANC. He has been identified as one of those positioning himself to take up the reins of the tough &quot;new right&quot; of the Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His more uncharitable opponents accuse him of using the Truth and Reconciliation debate cynically, to relaunch his political career (he was Minister of Home Affairs in the De Klerk government). Says one source close to the NP: &quot;He was trying to show the NP caucus that he could get more concessions out of the ANC than the softies in cabinet. The battle over the Truth Commission has been one long and extended media opportunity for him. No wonder he didn't want it to end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schutte feels victorious: his doggedness has ensured that the commission will no longer be a &quot;witch hunt in the service of vengeance, but rather an instrument for reconciliation&quot;. Also, very importantly, it will be &quot;even- handed in its approach to both sides&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He says he has come to believe that &quot;a Truth and Reconciliation Commission is the only way forward, because it is a way of getting the past out of the way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Granted, Schutte is a second-language English speaker. But listen carefully: &quot;It is essential that this country turns to the future and turns its back on the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alex Boraine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the mid-1980s, while he was still a Member of Parliament, Alex Boraine went to visit Dullah Omar in jail. It was their first meeting, and the radical lawyer did not mince his words. &quot;He asked me,&quot; recalls Boraine, &quot;who I thought I was, coming to see him in jail and then going back to my white parliament to stand up and make speeches while he was banned from speaking?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nine years later, on the day after Omar took office as Minister of Justice, he phoned Boraine and asked him to come in and talk about the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reconciliation in motion. Boraine was one of the Act's primary drafters. He will probably be appointed to the Commission and, if he weren't white, he would be a shoo-in for its chairmanship -- a position that is more likely to go to a high-level black cleric (the names of Desmond Tutu and Frank Chikane are much bandied about).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Briefly and powerfully, he scorched white South African consciousness in 1986 when he, together with Van Zyl Slabbert, walked out of parliament. It was, to some, an intense betrayal, to others an intense acknowledgment of prior complicity. It figures that he would make &quot;Truth and Reconciliation&quot; his life's work: he epitomises white guilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Truth Commission, he says, &quot;will give a shared memory to the people of South Africa. It will give ordinary people a record of what they stood for and what they were punished for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The face of the state is one of hostility -- the hostility of a police station, a hospital, a morgue when you are looking for your lost son. &quot;It may sound romantically idealistic, but if a group of people appointed by the President of South Africa offer you a cup of tea and ask you to tell your story, you're now going to be seeing a face of the state that is sympathetic, reassuring, healing ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank heavens for the self-concious romanticism of liberals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Willie Hofmeyr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1989 Willie Hofmeyr went on hunger strike for 28 days. The previous year, he had been locked up in solitary confinement for six months. He is the chuckling master of wry understatement: &quot;We tried to keep things as cool as possible,&quot; he says of the Justice Committee where, as the ranking ANC member after chairman Johnny de Lange, he has been responsible for bringing out the ANC heavy artillery. &quot;But there were times when having to plead and negotiate for a Truth Commission with the perpetrators of crimes against humanity did get one down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hofmeyr, like his primary adversary Danie Schutte, is an Afrikaner. He went &quot;striaght out of school to the army, full of naive enthusiasm. But the army radicalised me more than anything. I was in the Transvaal and it was the first place I experienced hardcore racism. Things are much more gentle here in the Cape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the 1970s he was banned, in the 1980s he was a United Democratic Front leader. Now he is one of the ANC's egghead lawyers, a steely determination masked by his affable, nerdlike demeanour. He no longer sees himself as a victim in need of healing: &quot;I was plunged into that work when I had to make arrangements for the first Groote Schuur meeting. There I was, sitting face to face with policemen I had had a particularly bad relationship with, and having to come to agreement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, he acknowledges, his own experiences have given him a very sharp sense of how &quot;the experiences of victims need to be validated. With all these negotiations and the transition, victims have been left by the wayside, and that's just not on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Did Hofmeyr and his ANC colleagues sell justice down the river by acceding to so many of the NP's demands? &quot;How ever much justice might require it,&quot; he said, &quot;the one compromise is that we're not going to have Nuremburg-type trials in South Africa. This might be against what international human rights and norms require from us, but the ANC accepted that very early on. I certainly did. A negotiations process means having to work with and live with and build together with people who treated us very badly in the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 19, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- South Africa enters the satellite TV age tomorrow when African Satellite Entertainment (ASE) starts beaming trial broadcasts into the country. It will go &quot;live&quot; a week later with the country's first Kuband (small dish) service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASE has pre-empted M-Net by three months, and caught the authorities on the wrong foot by beaming its signal from Swaziland -- outside the jurisdiction of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASE managing director Mark Grey says the channel will comprise a mixture of news and entertaiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IBA yesterday responded to the ASE launch with a vaguely-worded statement which neither endorses nor condemns the new development. According to the statement, the IBA &quot;has initiated a process of consultation and interaction with leading players in the satellite industry to establish a framework for a public inquiry into satellite broadcasting&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The IBA is &quot;excited by the challenges and opportunities of satellite broadcasting&quot;, but is trying to ensure that &quot;satellite broadcasting benefits all South Africans and does not unfairly discriminate against existing and new terrestial broadcasters,&quot; the statement says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grey said ASE had no intention of being a pirate broadcaster, and was confident that his company's plans had the blessing of the IBA. But the fact remains that the IBA is powerless to stop a signal being beamed up from a neighbouring country, as is the case with ASE's broadcasts from Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cobus Scholtz of Multinet, the company which handles the technical side of M-Net's broadcasting operations, said he was optimistic that the IBA would approve M-Net's move to satellite broadcasting in South Africa.  Elsewhere in Africa the dearth of broadcasting meant there would be no resistance to new broadcasters entering the market, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASE has managed to get a foot in the door by using an exisiting satellite (Intelsat 704) to bounce its signal to South Africa. M-Net will have to wait until August, when the PAS-4 satellite is launched, to start broadcasting its subscriber service which will cover Africa as far north as Cairo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For now, ASE will broadcast on a free-to-air analogue system, meaning that viewers will only need to buy a satellite dish and receiver to pick up the channel. There is no need for a decoder, and no subscription fee to receive the channel. Grey said ASE will reassess the situation at the end of the year in the light of new developments in digital broadcasting technology.  He said that by 1996 the company aims to operate 16 digital channels -- requiring a decoder -- and two free-to-air channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M-Net will offer a range of services depending on how much the subscriber is prepared to pay. The full range, which requires a decoder, will include 21 channels along the lines of M-Net's existing formula. M-Net will also broadcast the SABC channels via satellite. Getting the SABC via satellite will not require a decoder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grey said the station would &quot;cater for the needs of all South Africans&quot; rather than targetting an elite -- a choice which seems ready-made to please the IBA.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Nelson Mandela added to the discomfort of mine owners when he announced on Monday that he was giving R10 000 of his own money to the fund for the victims of the Vaal Reefs mine disaster. He was showing extraordinary generosity and a fine sense of public relations, and he was signalling that this government viewed such incidents in a way that no South African government has done before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela is honorary life president of the National Union of Mineworkers; ANC general secretary Cyril Ramaphosa made his name as general secretary of the union; his deputy in the union, Marcel Golding, is chairman of the parliamentary committee on mineral affairs; that union is a major force in Cosatu, an alliance partner with the ANC and the Communist Party.  But the links are not just personal and historical; mineworkers are now voters -- and a sizeable block of them. They are, for the first time, people who can claim their rights as citizens. And Mandela was demonstrating his government's willingness to hear those claims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mining industry will never be the same again after last week's incident. It was going to have to change anyway with this week's publication of the hard-hitting Leon inquiry into mine safety. The facts alone are startling: every ton of gold costs roughly one life and 12 serious injuries; since the turn of the century, the mines have claimed the lives of 69 000 miners and seriously injured a million more. The vast bulk of this damage happens not in high- profile accidents, but in relatively small routine incidents that barely merit a media report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Judge Ramon Leon's conclusion was unequivocal: &quot;The status quo cannot continue.&quot; You can be certain, after this week's events, it won't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gone are the days when the mine owners will be able to get away with a few words of sympathy and a little cash for the funeral. Nor will it rest with their contribution of R2,5- million to the victims' fund. The way the mines work, the attitude to workers who risk their lives every day for very little money, the resources the mines put into safety --- all this is going to have to change. Expect a revolution in the world's cruellest industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The industry knows this, which is why Vaal Reefs shares fell significantly within hours of the accident. It wasn't only because production would be affected. The market had spoken. And so had the president.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign affairs' plans for the allocation of its budget took a bashing from MPs in Parliament. MPs grilled Foreign Affairs Director General Rusty Evans this week, asking why his department's R1,13-billion budget did not reflect South Africa's new foreign policy goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Figures presented by Evans to Parliament's portfolio committee on foreign affairs showed most money would be spent on existing missions based largely in the United States and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evans himself told the committee new priorities for his department included greater focus on building relations in Southern Africa and among African countries, through organisations like the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said new goals included more emphasis on Asia and the Far East, multi-lateral diplomacy through the United Nations and the Non-aligned Movement and securing a new relationship with the European Union (EU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But MPs learned there were &quot;insufficient funds&quot; to set up new missions in Lagos, Dar-es-Salaam and Addis Ababa -- home of the OAU's headquarters -- or to upgrade the mission in Gaberone, headquarters of the SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evans said the wording was &quot;wrong&quot; and appealed to the committee for help in pressing government to provide additional funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bulky document answering written questions submitted earlier by committee members noted that R50-million budgeted for opening new missions (at an average cost of about R6,5-million each) was suspended by Cabinet in February &quot;pending an investigation into the rationalisation of all foreign services&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without new funds, no planning for new resident missions abroad could go ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Downscaling larger missions to fund new, smaller missions merited consideration but it was &quot;highly doubtful&quot; this would release funds because of &quot;transfer costs&quot; and the expense of &quot;unutilised existing office accommodation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Around R518-million has been allocated to missions in the US (South Africa's consulate general in Beverly Hills will get R7,3-million), Europe, South America, Canada and India. About R106-million will be spent on missions in African and Middle Eastern countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evans maintained that African and Middle Eastern countries were &quot;area(s) of first priority&quot;. Foreign Affairs would have to shift spending from the &quot;established&quot; to the &quot;developing&quot; world, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But MPs observed little progress had been made in doing so. Commented an MP afterwards: &quot;What emerges from today's discussion is that the department hasn't even started re- prioritising its budget.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New rules of Parliament mean portfolio committees can now monitor, inquire into and make recommendations on government departments' budgets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foreign affairs budget will be tabled in Parliament on May 18.  Alongside it will be the committee's report assessing the extent to which spending has been re- prioritised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evans, whose department has yet to produce a white paper outlining policy, used the briefing to give a broad overview of foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the graphic cover-sheet on copies of the budget drew criticism: &quot;We start with Latin America and end in Canberra,&quot; said ANC MP Fatima Haij.  &quot;We are spending money to create a new image and this is what the department is doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC MP Dr Rob Davies said to date the department had been operating on an incremental budgeting process - increasing allocations that already existed, and adding on funds to set up new missions. He asked how the department would balance the demands of old missions against the new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also asked whether allocations for a number of missions in former Eastern Bloc countries were necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other areas probed by MPs included R35,5-million earmarked for Channel Africa, South Africa's external radio service which replaced Radio RSA -- used to combat the &quot;total onslaught&quot; of the 1980s -- but is still funded by Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evans said Channel Africa -- which covered the entire continent reaching areas, especially in Southern Africa, other external services did not, was used to market South Africa. Funding it through the epartment was &quot;effective and satisfactory&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICAN National Congress MP Jenny Schreiner leaves Parliament each day at 5 pm. If she's in a meeting, she excuses herself. If the National Assembly is sitting late, it does so without her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a principle, it's not a good one, Schreiner readily concedes. &quot;It disempowers me,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm not seeing things through to their conclusion and it has an effect on the way I see my role and what I'm achieving.&quot; But if she did not set these limits, she would never see her child, Nikita (3) -- and he would never see his single parent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Parliament, says Schreiner, functions on the assumption that those who work there all have someone at home -- someone who will bear and rear their children, run the household, buy the groceries, even organise their social life. In other words, a wife. Parliament, says Schreiner, is a man's world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She is one of 117 women in Parliament who, last May, took up 101 of 400 National Assembly seats and 16 of 90 seats in the Senate. Their entry into Parliament catapulted South Africa to seventh position in the world in terms of women's representation in legislatures -- a goal women in other ranking countries fought for decades to reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Here, it was achieved by dint of the vision and determination of a small band of ANC women who, during negotiations, fought and won the battle for a 33,3 percent quota. Thanks largely to them, the Speaker in the National Assembly, Frene Ginwala, is a woman; there are three female ministers and three female deputy ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, as Schreiner points out, affirmative action is not the same thing as gender transformation, which means altering the sexual division of labour which lies at the heart of gender oppression. Getting a domestic worker would free her to work, but by simply shifting the burden on to another woman, it wouldn't resolve the fundamental problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact that you have a sizeable presence of women in Parliament doesn't mean they are all committed to gender transformation,&quot; she says.  &quot;Many are more interested in their own career paths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You're talking about a small group of women who are over- extended, who need to be in every single arena of this institution, on every committee -- and we don't have that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his State of the Nation address, President Nelson Mandela said: &quot;It is vitally important that all structures of government, including the President himself, should understand this fully: that freedom cannot be achieved unless women have been emancipated from all forms of oppression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those driving the gender agenda interpret this to mean a lot more than casting an eye over committees to ensure women have token representation, or simply adding on to government white papers sections dealing with gender issues. But they're operating in an arena that has always been exclusively male.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Schreiner jokes about arguments with male colleagues over air-conditioners set too cold. Women freeze, while men -- in their suits -- are fine. Former trade unionist Pregs Govender had her partner accompany her to Parliament's first sitting, to be told by a clerk that &quot;wives sit upstairs&quot;. ANC MP Nomatyala Hangana recalls one of the first things female MPs had to do was &quot;organise toilets -- we had to walk flights of stairs to find a 'Members' Wives' loo&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Talk to male MPs about how they experience the new presence of women in parliament and you get comments about the attractive outfits they wear and how they &quot;brighten the place up&quot;. So much for the level of gender discourse in our legislature -- and little wonder, then, that for female ANC MPs, gender awareness training is a priority. For both men and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you understand all the issues,&quot; says ANC MP Mavivi Manzini. &quot;A piece of legislation can look quite neutral until it's implemented and you see the impact on women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Schreiner: &quot;First, we have to convince people of the need to do it. But it is only when everyone understands that gender feeds into everything they deal with that we'll be able to get anywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The reality is that a lot of decisions affecting society as a whole get made over whiskies in a pub by members of the old-boys' club,&quot; says Govender. &quot;Women lack the same networks and don't operate like that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've had to grapple with a totally new institution and culture.  We've had to see how we can work the system and not be worked over by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The definition of power is particularly hierarchical -- and the Westminster system, with its system of whips like school prefects, feeds on it. It's not a user-friendly political environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In the movement, you did something because you felt strongly about it, not because you were going to be garlanded. You had people prepared to work for long hours with little pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Coming here, a hierarchy's imposed: people earn more as a whip or for chairing a committee. People came here from organisations with a collective spirit, where people could challenge each other. The way parliament works -- it's an institution for lawyers. Everyone has battled to find their feet, not just the women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Baleka Kgositsile, veteran women's rights campaigner, describes subtle ways a woman can find herself undermined: &quot;We're socialised to believe women carry the major responsibility for children, so when something goes wrong at home you feel guilty -- that you've made the wrong choice. When a man has family problems there's more sympathy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As a woman you're pushing the fact that women can do things. It makes it look as if you have no problems. You also don't want to speak about them because it supports the argument that women can't cope.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women have had to strategise over raising gender issues: &quot;Once you start talking about women, people tend to cut off -- they stop listening,&quot; says Kgositsile. Says Govender: &quot;Men tend to make distinctions between women, especially where their styles differ. Maybe it's unconscious, but the result is to divide women. You get men saying, 'OK, we can take you seriously, but she is totally neurotic'. The only way to fight this is to have solidarity among women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, while the ANC women's caucus meets regularly, a multi- party women's caucus is still embryonic. &quot;Women in other parties felt they first wanted to form their own caucuses,&quot; says Manzini. NP women had to wait for their caucus to give the okay, says Kgositsile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's female parliamentarians are a diverse group. They come from different political parties, cultures and backgrounds. Levels of education and experience vary -- a woman with a master's degree may sit alongside a woman who has difficulty reading, but who knows all there is to know about organising a rural constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is there a basis for sisterhood among the women in Parliament? &quot;I'm not sure,&quot; says Schreiner. &quot;I'm not saying we can't get together on issues.  We can mobilise, but class, race and ideological divisions run far deeper than the unity provided by us all being women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yes, there is, says women's rights activist Brigitte Mabandla, now Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture, Science and Technology. &quot;We can't pretend there aren't differences -- but there is a meeting place, and that's gender. Women can bond on issues like violence against women, for example. As women, we have a basis for talking. We need a multi-party women's caucus because there are experiences unique to women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many black female MPs bring to Parliament a range of skills and understanding that are either ignored or under-valued by their white counterparts, says Govender. It leaves women feeling inadequate, alienated or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's not enough just to open up opportunities and allow women in,&quot; says Kgositsile. &quot;It's a question of creating an atmosphere that's conducive to their feeling empowered and able to cope rather than just wanting to return home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Mabandla: &quot;There's an assumption the ANC women here are from an elite, which isn't true. There are women here who cannot write, who want to return to their constituencies where they feel of more use.&quot; And the contribution of women not proficient in English, who make their speeches in Sotho or Xhosa, often goes unnoticed, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, despite the challenges, women are making an impact on Parliament.  Their influence has been especially noticeable in the various parliamentary committees. Says Mabandla: &quot;Women (on committees) have played a very important role in terms of inputs, direction and the quality of their participation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's Thenjiwe Mtintso, for example, serves on the defence committee. It was she who led a call for the defence budget to be slashed -- during a briefing by Minister of Defence Joe Modise. Govender, on the finance committee, was instrumental in blocking a recommendation that the child rebate be abolished, arguing that this would hit single women who head households -- an indicator of poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We're beginning to grapple with being here. We're working out our way around Parliament, our relationship to its processes, to each other and to civil society,&quot; says Govender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think the time spent has been wasted. People have learned an incredible amount and are now in a far better position to define themselves and the issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Attitudes are also changing. Says Mabandla: &quot;I think when we came here there was a resentment, an unsureness on the part of men over how to treat us -- as ladies or as mamas. But women have been complimented (in the House) on the contribution they have made. In the committees we're taken seriously, they listen quite carefully and don't shut off anymore.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Says Manzini: &quot;I think people have now started to respect us on the basis of who and what we are. Just our presence here means you no longer find people expressing themselves in overtly sexist ways.&quot; Mail &amp; Guardian May 12, 1995 In last week's feature on women in Parliament, we described MP Jennifer Schreiner as a single parent. In fact, this is only true when her duties keep her in Cape Town. The child's father lives in Johannesburg and &quot;is a very strong presence in both (my daughter) Nikita's and my lives ... part of the familial dislocation MPs endure&quot;, Schreiner says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Reg Rumney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- The points of agreement and disagreement between business and labour about weighty issues are seldom scrutinised together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Community Agency for Social Enquiry (Case) research agency did just this in a survey commissioned by the Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian, the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), and the South African Broadcasting Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey, in-depth telephone interviews with 100 top business people and fifty-five union leaders on a wide range of issues, was conducted in April this year by Mark Orkin of Case, and Ann Kushlick, with the help of Samantha Smirinl, Poppy Makalima and Sello Molefe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a follow-up to a similar survey done16 months ago which canvassed the views of 100 top business people. An important finding of the previous survey was white businessmen's fear of the more powerful role unions would play in economic affairs. So this time around top unionists were also asked to articulate their assessment of political, social and economic change in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The business sample covered 100 top sectors of business countrywide, including all the major conglomerates. It comprised 23 black, one coloured, three Indian, and 73 white business people. Eighty-six were men and 14 were women. The union sample included 55 unionists, all national or regional office bearers, approximately in proportion to the sizes of the six major union federations. The sample included 44 black, two coloured, one Indian and eight white unionists. Forty-eight were men and seven were women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business response to the first Budget of the Government of National Unity was overwhelmingly positive. A survey of 100 of South Africa's top business people, undertaken by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry (Case) just after the Budget of the GNU, shows almost three quarters of the business people polled viewed the Budget positively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White business people were the most positive (78 percent) of those polled. According to Case, many white business people (63 percent) thought Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg's Budget indicated &quot;responsible and fiscally disciplined government&quot; which valued &quot;fairness and equality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fewer black business people (57 percent) were as positive, more of them were unsure of its effectiveness. Only 23 percent of black business people mentioned a responsible and fair government as the basis of their positive assessment. &quot;They tended,&quot; say the Case researchers, &quot;to opt rather for the explanation that the government was now properly focusing on social spending, and addressing the needs and grievances of the poor and unemployed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventy-eight percent of the overall business sample -- and 93 percent of business women -- thought enough had been done to reduce the Budget deficit. This figure -- the difference between budgeted government spending and tax revenue, which has to be borrowed -- is a symbol of fiscal responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those who did not agree that enough had been done thought that cutting the public service as well as the defence budget would have helped to reduce the deficit. A low six percent of all business people consider too high taxation a negative, though more black business people came to this conclusion (14 percent) than whites (six percent). Similarly a low percentage consider personal tax too high, perhaps indicating relief that no super-tax or wealth tax was introduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White and black business people differed strikingly on whether the emphasis in tax policy should shift from direct tax, chiefly personal income tax and company tax, to indirect tax, chiefly Value Added Tax. Sixty-six percent of white respondents favoured more indirect tax, as opposed to only 17 percent of black respondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business respondents to the survey put prevention of crime and violence as the top priority of the Government of National Unity (38 percent of respondents). Job creation is second, and ensuring delivery of promises third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the previous survey, conducted 16 months ago, the incoming government's top priority was seen as job creation (34 percent of respondents) with violence and crime coming in third at only 13 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the latest survey, concern about crime crops up again in responses to questions about fears for the future. The greatest fears for the future were violence, crime and political instability (30 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next came fears that the GNU would disintegrate (24 percent); and that South Africa would become a &quot;banana republic&quot; where famine and political strife prevail (23 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By comparison, 1993 business respondents mentioned economic mismanagement as their greatest fear, and few alluded to political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No to ANC's alliance with Cosatu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 63 percent of business respondents to the survey vote &quot;no&quot; to the question, &quot;Should the ANC/Cosatu alliance continue?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Seventy-one percent of whites say no, and 39 percent of blacks. The contrast, says Case, mirrors the divisions between black and white business leaders on economic issues like redistribution, and contract quotas for small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many black respondents (61 percent) and few whites (22 percent) claim to be very familiar with the Reconstruction and Development Programme. Most whites (74 percent) are only &quot;somewhat&quot; familiar with the RDP. All agreed business should support it financially as well as increase their own social responsibility programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Whites tended to be more optimistic about the RDP's ultimate success (58 percent) while blacks (48 percent) were more tentative, with the majority expecting RDP success only if it is implemented properly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Interviewees commented on the vagueness of the RDP, which they felt hinders involvement, and a discouraging lack of government commitment to actual implementation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour satisfied with Budget deficit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Labour leaders seem satisfied about the Budget deficit, the figure symbolic of &quot;fiscal discipline&quot;, according to a survey by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry of fifty-five union leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This could signal that government leaders, principally Deputy Finance Minister Alec Erwin and Reconstruction and Development Programme Minister Jay Naidoo, have done a good job of selling the concept to union leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey shows that many unionists are satisfied the deficit has been cut enough -- and many think it could have been cut further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost half of the union respondents thought more could have been done to cut the deficit, notably through reducing further the amount devoted to defence. Otherwise, unionists were notably less positive about the Budget than business (47 percent as opposed to 73 percent for business).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those in favour mentioned similar factors to business, such as responsible government and higher social spending. Of those against, equal proportions mentioned unaddressed problems, inadequate commitment to the RDP and high defence spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty percent of unionists were in favour of increased Value Added Tax. This was less than the business respondents, 56 percent of whom were in favour -- but not as big a difference as one would have supposed, given the vociferious union opposition to the introduction of VAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those against were concerned that it would exacerbate the plight of the destitute. In this they largely agreed with black business people, far fewer of whom thought more emphasis on indirect tax was a good idea than whites.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- Labour and business agree on several key issues -- but important differences remain. Despite important and expected differences, business and labour are like a nest of singing birds on key issues, a survey of both groups shows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ninety percent of those polled believe &quot;the country is heading in the right direction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey was done by the Community Agency for Social Enquiry (Case) for the Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian, the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), and the South African Broadcasting Corporation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most fervent hope of both business and labour is for national prosperity where democracy, peace and a high standard of living reach the entire population. The similarity in outlook is most obvious when looking at the &quot;broader picture&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take crime and violence. Thirty-nine percent of business respondents believe the top priority for the government is combating crime and general instability: unions feel the highest priority should be creating a common vision and instilling trust in the Government of National Unity (GNU). And while unions give greater priority than business to jobs for all, both union and business leaders fear the escalation of violence and racial conflict as a great threat to South Africa's positive development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Despite their differences of opinion on the question of violence and personal safety, unions' greatest fears were much the same as business': that violence, crime and political instability would escalate (37 percent) and that the GNU and all its ideals would disintegrate (20 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Unionists' most fervent hopes were again the same as business'. A hope for national prosperity for all (44 percent) was followed by a hope for South Africa to become a thriving modern economy able to compete internationally (11 percent). That South Africa becomes a 'number one example', and,'the strongest state in Africa', were sentiments frequently encountered,&quot; says Case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both labour and business think the economic upturn is sustainable.Both are in favour of a quota of contracts being given to small businesses and would like to see the government giving small businesses financial support and incentives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business and labour agree on certain fundamental issues, such as affirmative action being seen as firmly entrenched for all disadvantaged groups -- though black business people and unionists are more sceptical about its effects than whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both groups agree that the Reconstruction and Development Programme must be realised through responsible government, and in this way increase local confidence, investment and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both groups strongly support an increased focus on small business and ways to help initiate it as a powerful force in creating employment.Negotiation is seen to be an important element in the workplace despite some union reservation about workplace forums undermining their own power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unions and businesses are aware of the importance of educating their respective members about the upcoming local elections. Most unions (71 percent), like businesses (71 percent), have implemented some kind of voter registration programme for the local elections. Most union respondents (87 percent) have already registered themselves, as have business leaders (77 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;President Mandela is clearly seen as a unique individual whose leadership qualities, statesmanship and integrity set a lead in the reconciliation of all South Africans. He is a unifying force that cuts across race, gender and class,&quot; notes Case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business and labour similarly see the National Economic, Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) as an effective negotiating forum for all sectors. But 25 percent of unionists and 30 percent of business people polled are &quot;unsure&quot;, indicating the need for evidence of Nedlac's efficacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unionists endorse the idea that corruption in all sectors is on the increase (51 percent). Fifty-three percent of business respondents thought so too. Women unionists felt that the increase was only owing to the fact that corruption was now brought out in the open for everyone to see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Union respondents were, predictably, more concerned about matters of redistribution and equity, such as the effect on the poor of higher VAT.  Union and business leaders are dramatically opposed on the issue of redistribution. Where 58 percent of business people believe the government has done enough on redistribution, 56 percent of unionists are not satisfied with the government's efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike business respondents, 75 percent of whom think scrapping exchange control is a good idea, most unionists are opposed to the idea (56 percent against). Women unionists are especially opposed at 86 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And where business overwhelmingly supports the privatisation of state corporations, almost half of the unionists polled oppose this. Another key difference was the attitude to management salaries. Sixty-nine percent of business respondents naturally believe management salary increases should not be held back to reduce pay differentials, 67 percent of unionists, not unexpectedly, think they should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Conversely, where half of business leaders felt unions should hold back wage demands to allow increased employment, 87 percent of union leaders disagreed,&quot; said Case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was a 60 percent overall union vote for workplace forums, as opposed to 75 percent in the business sector. More unionists are &quot;unsure&quot; mainly due to the belief these forums will undermine union and shop steward power.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Jacques Magliolo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- An agreement has been signed which allows banks to enter the inner stockbrokers' circle. Chaos was averted at the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last month, but not completely eliminated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JSE and the Council of South African Banks (Cosab) reached an agreement to provide institutions with trading powers from November, thereby preventing banks' threats of setting up an alternative exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, while these threats have now been eliminated, a question mark still hangs over the future of banking-stockbroking in this country and signifies an uncharted role for the exchange.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, JSE executive president Roy Andersen -- backed by the JSE committee -- knew, before signing the agreement, that stockbrokers would not easily give up their privileged position as having sole right to trade shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet over the past year Andersen has compromised little and has shown a strength seldom displayed by previous exchange leaders. He has not strayed from his intention of retaining the ideals of the exchange, while still showing willingness to adopt a policy of aligning the exchange to that of international stock markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His attitude is displayed by permitting banks into the inner stockbrokers' circle, but simultaneously enforcing a unified system for all members. This includes a single surveillance system for all trades and one mechanism for trading shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took a year to debate and finalise the Cosab agreement, which outlines criteria and timing for the admission of banks as members of the JSE. As part of the negotiated agreement, the JSE was able to obtain an undertaking from Cosab to co-operate on the restructuring of both the JSE and the settlement system for equity transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial thoughts that Andersen had capitulated and sold out stockbrokers were not correct. He has also been able to push through, for stockbrokers, a dual trading system. This will permit all members of the exchange to trade for both their clients and their own book. Another benefit negotiated for stockbrokers is a limited liability clause to protect personal assets against company losses. Dual trading will take place after non-stockbroking firms become full corporate members in November and after shares are traded via computer in 1996. This is, however, subject to approval by members of the exchange, and to the necessary Act being passed by Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Andersen says: &quot;This timeframe is to enable non- stockbrokers (both local and foreign) to purchase up to 30 percent of member firms from July and for this percentage to increase to 100 percent on November 8. This should provide companies, which are wholly owned by non- stockbrokers, with time to become members of the JSE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The proposed changes are expected to be in line with developments in international exchanges, which aim to benefit investors, listed companies and stockbroking firms and should ease access to the market by prospective stockbrokers,&quot; says Andersen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Have the proposed changes achieved this? Only to a certain extent, in that the JSE's agreement with Cosab means that it can now concentrate on other potentially explosive issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bottom line is that signed agreements do not mean the end of potential chaos. Accepting change in theory and in practice are two extremely polar events. There are two main problems facing the JSE hierarchy:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * If banks trade for themselves, stockbrokers' revenue could diminish.  The JSE has no plans nor any policy to help stockbrokers adjust; it doesn't even have a considered opinion on how they can offset reduced income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stockbrokers have a number of options. They could sell a portion of their firms to local or foreign institutions, streamline operations through a rationalisation programme, or sell research directly for cash or for a portion of institutional funds which they can invest. They could become &quot;managers&quot; of deals for institutions, thus taking orders to buy and sell (broker deals) for institutions or they could trade for both themselves and for clients in a dual-capacity system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Banks' ability to trade for themselves could strengthen their stranglehold over the exchange and further reduce liquidity in an already illiquid market. In addition, banks have not shown any willingness to accept the King Report recommendations, which provide for greater disclosure and transparency by all listed companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JSE's total market capitalisation is about R830- billion, yet the four largest banks' ownership of shares grew by 31 percent last year to R175,3-billion. This represents an astounding 21 percent control over all listed companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banks' ability to wield such powers over share prices would surely be unacceptable under Andersen's leadership, particularly if these banks refuse to abide by greater levels of transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The JSE still has some way to go before problems are ironed out and the transition to a fully automated, more transparent system has been accomplished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Mark Gevisser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 12, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- Nelson Mandela's Budget speech last week was co-written by a dozen white female secretaries in Cape Town, a group of female squatters in Gauteng, and some coloured professionals in the Cape. And they didn't even know it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Call it Rule by Focus Group. The impact of Clinton pollster Stanley Greenberg in the last election has been a new, media-savvy ANC. Whenever the President's Office needs to know what people are thinking, it rustles up some blind focus-groups (small groups of people from a particular background assembled as a test bed for ideas) via Markinor, and uses the Human Sciences Research Council's quarterly survey too.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last focus groups were set up in Gauteng, the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape. The basic question: How are we doing? According to the presidential communications director Joel Netshitenzhe, &quot;both the focus groups and the HSRC survey show the major concern that most South Africans have is with jobs.&quot; That, he says, is why the president's Budget-speech put so much emphaisis on job-creation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other concern is crime. This, says Netshitenzhe, is one of the reasons behind Mandela's new determination to kickstart community policing in four crime-ridden provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About delivery of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, &quot;there is an acceptance that people do have aspirations --they want housing-- rather than expectations. The message from our focus-groups is: 'We'll give you five to seven years to deliver, but we want to see the foundations now.'&quot; There is also far more goodwill from the very poor --who have physically felt the benefits of school lunches and free medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President's Office has decided the problem is not one of delivery but communication. And so, as a result of the focus group research, says Netshitenzhe, &quot;we have decided to be more proactive about the president's schedule. Rather than just responding to invitations -- which tend to come from elites who have computers and fax machines -- we are identifying places we want the president to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, for example, the president went to open an RDP project in the Free State; in recent weeks he has launched a water project outside Pretoria and also done a tour of schools in Gauteng. &quot;We have found too,&quot; says Netshitenzhe, &quot;that nothing inspires him and gives him strength as much as going out and meeting people. He comes out feeling charged.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Age: Somewhere between angry young actor and &quot;old fart&quot; of South African political theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Claim to fame: Overcame parental prejudice that grown men should not appear in public and make fools of themselves to win a slew of acting awards including an American Tony for his Broadway performance in The Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Present occupation: Risking being labelled the Brian Mitchell of the theatre by staging a surprise comeback performance in the selfsame, much-revived play, which made his name more than 20 years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is that a big job? It's a doddle compared with being executive director of the Market Theatre where he faces the gruelling task of putting bums back on seats in the once trendy complex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But isn't visiting the Market dangerous? Yes, but contrary to popular mythology it's not the muggers you have to watch out for. You are more likely to be flattened by a minibus taxi whose occupants are urging, &quot;Make the Bold,&quot; the township war cry encouraging drivers to be more reckless so fans can get back to Soweto in time for a daily dose of The Bold and the Beautiful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What's that? The truth is that if there is any such thing as cultural glue between black and white, it is not a choice between Shakespeare or gumboot dancing, but the mutual passion for a soap about a group of good-looking Americans who have far too much money and spend it committing serial adultery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So why doesn't the Market just become more popular? Kani has mentioned staging the occasional imported farce. But in a surge of Pollyanna optimism opted instead for The Island, even though a politically relevant production like Titus Andronicus was an audience flop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What if the gamble fails? Stand back for another round of accusations about what unappreciative Philistines we all are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is Kani likely to say about the decision? &quot;The Island is a tribute to the spirit of the men on Robben Island who gave up their freedom for liberation.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- The African National Congress this week released details about how members can bring charges against individuals in the movement accused of breaching the party's code of conduct before its disciplinary committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a draft disciplinary procedure drawn up by the organisation's national executive committee, charges can be &quot;initiated for violations of the basic principles and norms of the ANC as laid down in the constitution of the ANC and the code of conduct for public representatives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It stipulates that &quot;any organ and/or branch of the ANC&quot; can initiate a charge at branch, provincial or national level. The disciplinary proceedings should take place at the regional level where the alleged violation took place.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charge must be prepared by a presenter on behalf of the organ or officials. This person will be appointed either by a branch secretary, a provincial secretary or a the secretary general of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charge has to be presented in writing and has to state clearly which section of the constitution or code of conduct has allegedly been violated. The affected party must be given a written copy of the charge at least five days before the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The procedure is designed to ensure &quot;discipline is applied in accordance with a just and fair procedure which is clear and simple&quot;. Members of the organisation must be presumed innocent until proven guilty and must have the chance to defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It includes clauses designed to guard against the &quot;politics of envy&quot; -- efforts by individuals to use the code as a way of venting personal grudges and grievances against colleagues in the movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Disciplinary proceedings shall not be brought as a means of solving private problems or as a means of interfering in the private lives of members unless the rules of the organisation are directly affected.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Misdemeanours that members can be charged with include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Violations of the constitution, principles, norms and decisions of the ANC. * Abuse of office, corruption, sexual harassment or misappropriation of funds. * Breaches of the code of conduct. The hearing has to be held within a reasonable period after the charge and the person charged must have a representative and interpreter, if one is needed, present.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- IN a bold move to clamp down on venality in public office, the African National Congress has decided its MPs must open their family assets and extra- parliamentary earnings to full public scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dramatic decision -- possibly a first for any political party in the world -- coincides with efforts by the ANC to extend its own internal code of conduct to all parliamentarians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's national executive committee decided at its last meeting to beef up its ethical code by insisting all of the party's elected representatives declare their private interests to the voters who put them in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The organisation has made this undertaking at the risk of revealing embarrassing details to the public while campaigning for local government elections -- even though other parties remain shielded from this kind of scrutiny under the present system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Water Affairs and Foresty Minister Kader Asmal, who chairs a subcommittee on ethics in the House of Assembly, told the Mail &amp; Guardian the decision &quot;sets an important precedent and a principle for other parties to follow&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the ANC's initiative would give a boost to plans by his parliamentary committee to set in place a code of conduct that will prevent corruption and money- grabbing by elected representatives of all political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our committee is busy working on a national code that we hope will apply to all members of the senate, assembly and provincial legislatures. We hope to finish our work by July so that the house is able to debate our recommendations when it comes back from recess in August.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is the only party in the country to have adopted an internal set of ethical rules in the absence of national regulations or legislation to govern the extra-parliamentary business activities of MPs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its code of conduct includes tough clauses that bar the party's elected officials from using government office or parliamentary posts to distribute patronage or obtain personal fortune -- and sets up a high-powered disciplinary committee to implement it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ministers, premiers and provincial executive councillors are prohibited from playing any active role in profit-making institutions and have to surrender all directorships they held before taking office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regulations require ANC members to declare their assets and all other posts from which there is financial benefit in other companies, boards or organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In particular, they shall disclose all consultancies, shareholdings and directorships or any form of payment received by them or their family from an external source,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It stipulates that MPs should treat their parliamentary posts as full-time and bans them from taking permanent employment in other jobs.  Lobbying for organisations and companies is strictly prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's code is in line with, if not more advanced than, progressive regulations for MPs in other western democracies. But it was flawed because these disclosures remained confidential and secret -- until the recent NEC decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's executive has set up a committee, which includes Asmal and secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa, to urgently devise a system for implementing its new &quot;transparency&quot; resolution.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is exceptional. As far as we know, the ANC is the first political party anywhere in the world to make this kind of ruling,&quot; said Asmal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national regulations being drafted by the House of Assembly's ethics subcommittee will be based initially on the ANC's code but will be refined and adapted to take into account suggestions from other parties.  Parliament will have to decide if the national ethics will be legislated or accepted as a set of in-house rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We in the ANC want full and public disclosure in a parliamentary register that will be open to journalists and we want an effective enforcement machinery,&quot; said Asmal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Lobbying should be banned. And it is important to include assets of family members and spouses in the declaration so that these can't be hidden from the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Stressing these were his personal views, Asmal said special regulations should be implemented for members of parliamentary standing committees as they could be in a position to influence policies that affect their vested interests. A code of ethics should also be devised for people in the chairs of parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said his ethics subcommittee's report to the assembly will be influenced by developments in other democracies, where there is a trend towards tightening the controls on pecuniary benefits that MPs can obtain from being in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It can, however, be expected to go much further than most other Western systems that were set in place before disclosure became a major parliamentary issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Since 1979 there have been a number of progressive developments and we have gained a lot of experience from countries like France, Spain, Ireland and Sweden. But at this stage there are still many countries that don't have the kinds of restrictions and discloure we are planning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asmal told the Mail &amp; Guardian that international publicity surrounding the Nolan Committee, set up in the British House of Commons to devise ways of curbing corruption and sleaze on the part of some of its MPs, would provide a major boost to the work of his committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said it was important to keep the code of conduct and the enforcement machinery simple and effective. &quot;Look at the United States, which has complex regulations and an expensive bureaucracy to administer it, but lots of corruption. We want to avoid that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Calland, director of the Parliamentary Information and Monitoring Service (Pims) in Cape Town, said the ANC's move &quot;was in keeping with trends around the world, including England and Russia, where MPs are banned from any outside business interests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Calland warned that it was vital for a national code to be legislated -- rather than enacted as a set of voluntary or in-house rules -- as a matter of urgency if &quot;transparency&quot; was to become more than just a buzzword.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- MEDIA-BASHING and government-run media slots offered no solution to the problems the government was having in informing people about what it was doing, ANC MP Carl Niehaus said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling for an urgent presidential commission to investigate how government communicates, Niehaus said the South African Communications Service (Sacs), formerly the propaganda arm of the National Party government, was an &quot;entirely unreconstructed&quot; organisation. He was speaking during a Sacs budget vote debate on Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In what could be interpreted as veiled criticism of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, under whose portfolio it falls, Niehaus said Sacs, whose budget last year was almost R52-million, had not been subjected to the detailed scrutiny other key institutions had faced. While there were &quot;many good people within it, dedicated to free and open information&quot;, it still carried baggage from the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government had started delivering, Niehaus said. &quot;Why then the sensitivity about how the government and its work are being perceived? Is it because the media in this country is not always accurately and adequately reflecting the progress we are making for ordinary people? Or does at least some of the problem lie closer to home?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our aim must be to ensure that those who communicate on behalf of the government do so fairly, effectively and in a manner which better equips the media to reflect on what we are doing.&quot; People had a right to know what the government was doing. But there could be little purpose in &quot;declaring the media to be an enemy as a first justification for withdrawing from an ongoing engagement with them in favour of government- run or controlled media slots&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki said assessing Sacs' role could not be done without addressing all other information structures within government. He said a conference of all central and provincial government communicators had been planned for August to recommend a &quot;comprehensive and all-embracing government communication policy&quot;, including the issue of government-controlled media slots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He announced that a cabinet committee would be discussing a Freedom of Information bill -- aimed at ensuring transparent and accountable government by giving citizens the right to access to information -- within the next two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said Sacs had made a &quot;serious effort&quot; to redress its staff racial imbalance and hoped new arrivals, especially those who were black and female, would help in the re-making of Sacs &quot;so that it gains the confidence of this House and the country at large as an instrument of democracy, non-racialism, non-sexism and accountable and open government&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Mark Gevisser</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- Welcome Msomi, creator of Umabatha, in The The divine justice of it all. When Welcome Msomi took his &quot;Zulu Macbeth&quot; to New York in 1979, he found it boycotted by the African National Congress and its supporters, who claimed that because it was &quot;ethnic&quot; (Zulu costumes, Zulu language, Zulu dancing), it had to be a government plot to promote separate development and the homeland system. The man responsible for the boycott was one Sipho Mzimela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now Mzimela is a cabinet minister from a party that built itself through Zulu chauvinism. And Msomi, the ethnicist, receives an on-stage embrace from Nelson Mandela for bringing, to the banquet of South African democracy, a revival of Umabatha.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was Welcome Msomi who stage-managed many of the public events in the ANC's election campaign. It was Welcome Msomi who mounted the &quot;Many Cultures, One Nation&quot; extravaganza at Mandela's inauguration, that rather bilious parade of cultural identities that nonetheless gave South Africans their first taste of National Reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is Welcome Msomi, now, who swans about the Civic Theatre on the opening night of Umabatha, heartily exchanging backslaps with the powerhouse assortment of blackoisie and ageing white bohemia, and clad in the leopard skins of a Zulu king. &quot;Poetic licence!&quot; he guffaws about his costume. But he is king tonight, triumphantly returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in his hand he clutches a trophy -- the rehabilitation of ethnicity, the glory of theatrical spectacle, the neatest possible multicultural overlay, a Zulu Macbeth, with a cast of thousands and a budget of millions and a bassline insistency that will (quite literally) entrance you until, ears ringing and heart pounding after the last, mesmeric curtain-call, you will be able to wipe your brow as you leave the concrete apartheid monstrosity that is The Civic and proclaim: &quot;Thank God! Theatre is not dead in this country after all! Hamba, Antony Sher! Bayete!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Umabatha is Shakespearean only in so far as Macbeth provides a story-line about betrayal and the vagaries of succession. Using the uniquely South African performance-styles that have already been well-encoded by Gibson Kente and Mbogeni Ngema, it is comedic rather than tragic, declarative rather than contemplative, presentational rather than naturalistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soliliquies are ribald confessions, not agonised introspections.  Like the masks of ritual African performance, Umabatha is expressionistic -- it distills and freezes emotions into intensely powerful grimaces and gestures. But into his pageant of Zuluness, Msomi mixes both subversive burlesque and rigid, unassailable hierarchy. His chorus-lines of stamping, phallus-waving amabuthi have none of the loose humanism of the kind of boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love 1950s schmaltz that tribal musicals such as Ipi Tombi and Meropa appropriated from Broadway. Rather, they hearken back to a kind of Busby Berkley-style purity, expressing social dynamics through the geometric constellations of bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thankfully, Umabatha has little of either Ipi Tombi's legendary &quot;Xplosion of Joy!&quot; or Sarafina's &quot;raw energy!&quot;. Energy it has, in buckets, but so refined is it that there is a powerfully alienating effect to the spectacle (an effect that many Zulu-speaking members of the audience attempt to overcome through constant interaction with the performers). In overseas reviews, critics mistook this elegance for noble savagery and tribal exuberance -- the Charleston News and Courier declared, rather lustfully, that &quot;the Zulus came stomping and shuffling through the audience, pounding drums, waving spears and shields, ablaze with barbaric beauty and looking as if they were going to massacre every last one of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Welcome Msomi is accommodating. He agrees to dress up in his kingly skins for a photo-shoot. And so he opens the door of his Sandton flat, ablaze with barbaric beauty. The flat is absolutely bare save inexplicably grand arrangements of blue and pink plastic flowers, and belies its occupant's repeated assertion that, &quot;I am home at last. I am here to stay&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He lives here with his wife, Thuli Dumakude. They have been in the flat for a year; their lives must have been either busy or transient or both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He played opposite her in the original Umabatha and now she is his assistant-director and chief choreographer. She has a voice that puts her in the Makeba league. When they took Umabatha to the States in 1979, they stayed; they came back to South Africa two-and- something years ago, leaving behind their Zulu language and dance school in Brooklyn and their teenage son, who will be joining them shortly and starting up at Michaelhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Msomi's aunt was the first wife of Zulu King Cyprian, Goodwill Zwelithini's father. The young Welcome, a slick city kid raised in Umlazi and schooled in Swaziland, spent many a school holiday at the Royal Kraal, and he has always seen himself as living quite comfortably in both his western and customary worlds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he started Umabatha in the early 1970s, he remembers, &quot;black academics said, 'you're taking us backwards. What will white people say?' They wanted to be seen only as people who have attained the white culture and didn't want to go back to themselves. They thought anything tribal was demeaning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then, the territory was fraught at home by the fact that theatres were all-white and abroad by the first stirrings of the cultural boycott. Now, in the era where the battle over who owns Zulu history costs lives and the new black elite flocks to the theatre in the fashion-modified paraphernalia of ethnicity, a revival of Umabatha has other implications. &quot;We have to demystify the whole image of the traditional Zulu garb being associated with Inkatha. Zulus are just Zulus. The richness of a culture can be so easily lost in this whole political conflict, so we have to move away from saying 'this is Zulu' and 'these are the people who control it.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Macbeth is the story of an ambitious prince who betrays the king, attains power, and causes chaos in the land of Scotland. &quot;Listen,&quot; says Msomi defensively. &quot;I wrote this in the 1960s! Zulu history has always been filled with plotting -- look at Shaka, Dingane, Cetshwayo. People weren't happy with the royalty so they tried to take over. And those who tried to take over ended up dying by the spear. There is a lesson to be learned for people who are after power and are not supposed to have that power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A four-syllabled silence, Bu-the-le-zi, hangs briefly over the air between us before Msomi banishes it by letting loose one of his characteristic eruptions of laughter. &quot;I know what you're thinking! Don't push it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If Msomi were to ask me what to put, on a visa application, as his profession, I would advise: &quot;Cultural Interlocutor&quot;. Since being back in South Africa, he has been employed by the advertising industry in what cynics would call the &quot;black guru&quot; post -- telling white capital how to reach the black market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has just set up a public relations company, Msomi Hunt Lascaris, the main function of which is corporate image-building. One of his first clients is Basil Elk Real Estate. We erupt, together, in laughter at the image of an ageing Jewish estate agent clad in skins and surrounded by warrior-like amabuthi as he peers out at the reader from the property pages of the Saturday Star. His laughter indicates some understanding of his difficult position: exoticist, primitiviser. Need an exotic spectacle? Call Msomi!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His work at Hunt Lascarris has largely involved the below-the-line stuff, creating events with an African feel. It was Msomi, for example, who transformed the Cresta shopping centre into a mythical jungle worthy of Sol Kerzner's febrile imagination, replete with lion cubs and sangomas, for the launch of the Zulu version of Disney Studios' The Lion King.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was excoriated by my colleague, Bafana Khumalo, for his use of sangomas to sell a product, and Msomi acknowledges, easily, &quot;I was wrong.  There are certain things that are dear to the African people, which one cannot commercialise, not only because it is in bad taste and would thus turn consumers off, but because if we don't keep those things special, we are selling our souls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Welcome Msomi -- guru or stooge? There's a clue to the way he works, in his much-expressed irritation with &quot;the conferences and papers and positions about cultural policy. Let's get down to work!&quot; His plan is to use Umabatha to set into motion a network of regional traditional theatre companies, &quot;and I'm not going to wait for the government to approve of it and pay for it -- I'm just going to go ahead and do it, because I know it's right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as he did with the first Umabatha, when he had white authorities bellowing on one side and cultural commissars on the other. There's an unspoken bitterness towards ideologues; indeed, his primary reason for moving to the United States was not an act of political exile to join a liberation movement, but rather just the desire to be able &quot;to live freely&quot;. Msomi, I suspect, will serve a ruling class (be it big business or an ANC government) if it is in the interests of his career and his art, but he will not be beholden to it. He is neither a guru nor a stooge -- he makes great theatre.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mail &amp; Guardian (Johannesburg)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg -- Monday, May 22, marked the first anniversary of the detention and arrest of Nigerian writer and political activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.  Saro-Wiwa, the President of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (Mosop), is being held by the Nigerian authorities on charges of alleged mob murder and may face the death penalty, if convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the first nine months of his detention he was held without any charges and his trial at a special military tribunal started in February.  Saro-Wiwa's health has deteriorated in prison and has worsened since his trial began. The charges of mob murder that are laid against him are completely unfounded: the real, unofficial reason why Ken is being held is because he is fighting for the survival of his people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Saro-Wiwa has been the most prolific and outspoken leader of the Ogoni people (the Weekly Mail &amp;Guardian reported on January 13 1995) for more than a decade, fighting for his people's rights in Rivers State, the southernmost state of Nigeria. Ogoni people traditionally derive their main source of income from farming and fishing activities and are highly dependent on their land. Since 1958, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd. has been drilling for oil in Ogoniland. Much of the land in the densely populated area is being lost to drilling operations and what little land is left, is polluted by crude oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thick layers of crude often flow over land, vegetation and water surfaces. The oil dries up and cakes the land or may start fires which destroy hectares of forest and arable land. Wells are contaminated, pipe-lines are criss-crossing the land and gas flares illuminate the night sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People are losing the basics of their livelihood and neither the Nigerian government nor Shell has taken adequate steps to redress the situation. Nothing has been returned to the community whose land is being exploited and destroyed to fill the coffers of central government, which derives over 90% of its export earnings from crude oil. Visible protest actions have been staged by the Ogoni since 1990, only to evoke an increasingly brutal response from the Nigerian government and the oil company. About two thousand Ogoni people have been killed since violence in the area has escalated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the detention of Saro-Wiwa and other Ogoni leaders, the Nigerian military government is severely violating human rights. During the heydays of apartheid, it was the Nigerian government which -- among the African states -- was one of the most outspoken and critical opponents of the South African regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa now has an obligation as the newly- emerging leader in Africa to take a strong moral stance and show true leadership on the African continent by putting effective pressure on the Nigerian government to release Ken Saro-Wiwa and restore the land to the Ogoni people.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 26, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Saro-Wiwa, Military Hospital,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Port Harcourt, Nigeria -- A YEAR has gone by since I was rudely roused from my bed and clamped into detention. Sixty-five days in chains, weeks of starvation, months of mental torture and, recently, the rides in a steaming, airless Black Maria to appear before a kangaroo court, dubbed a special military tribunal, where the proceedings leave no doubt that the judgment has been written in advance. And a sentence of death against which there is no appeal is a certainty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fearful odds? Hardly. The men who ordain and supervise this show of shame, this tragic charade, are frightened by the word, the power of ideas, the power of the pen; by the demands of social justice and the rights of man.  Nor do they have a sense of history. They are so scared of the power of the word, that they do not read. And that is their funeral.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When, after years of writing, I decided to take the word to the streets to mobilise the Ogoni people, and empower them to protest against the devastation of their environment by Shell, and their denigration and dehumanisation by Nigeria's military dictators, I had no doubt where it could end. This knowledge has given me strength, courage and cheer -- and psychological advantage over my tormentors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only yesterday, the Spirit of Ogoni magicked into my cell a lovely poem by Jack Mapanje, the veteran of Kamuzu Banda's jails: four years without charge. I had met Jack in Potsdam in person in 1992 and wondered how he had survived it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Writing from Leeds University, his poem urged me to wear the armour of humour. The note at the end was also signed by Chengerai Hove, the award-winning Zimbabwean novelist. How wonderful to know how many fine men, the best brains, care for one's distress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately the fault lies at the door of the British government. It is the British government which supplies arms and credit to the military dictators of Nigeria, knowing full well that all such arms will only be used against innocent, unarmed citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is the British government which makes noises about democracy in Nigeria and Africa but supports military dictators to the hilt. It is the British government which supports the rape and devastation of the environment by a valued, tax-paying, labour-employing organisation like Shell. I lay my travails, the destruction of the Ogoni and other peoples in the Niger delta, at the door of the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ultimately, the decision is for the British people, the electorate, to stop this grand deceit, this double standard, which has lengthened the African nightmare and denigrates humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whether I live or die is immaterial. It is enough to know that there are people who commit time, money and energy to fight this one evil among so many others predominating worldwide. If they do not succeed today, they will succeed tomorrow. We must keep on striving to make the world a better place for all of mankind -- each one contributing his bit, in his or her own way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I salute you all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 5, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Amrit Manga</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tito Mboweni's Labour Ministry this week unwrapped a five-year programme aimed at radically reshaping its priorities within the new political, social and economic framework and which, in the process, will allow it to play a central role in achieving out society's two major objectives-&quot;the extension of democratic gains&quot; and the attainment of economic well-being.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will involves legislative changes, transformation of existing institutions and the building of new ones. It will also mean the implementation of commissions of investigation, whose finding will lay the basis for new policy and laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the five-year programme is to be effective, it will have to reach our and influence policy in almost every government department-from finance to justice, public works to reconstruction and development, trade and industry to education and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the framework within which the ministry operated in the apartheid era, the shifts needed to meet the requirements of the new situation are huge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will have to explore previously unworkable links between government and business, examine the possibility of national wage accords and, in that process, challenge traditional taboos that have formed the central pillars of the old macro-economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In formulation the new direction, the Labour Ministry will take its cue from the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP),&quot; the document outlining the five-year programme says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the RDP White Paper published late last year, the country needs an integrated economic policy that will &quot; achieve sustainable growth, viable employment creation and a movement towards full employment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to setting full employment as a target, the White Paper also emphasis the need for &quot;greater participation is the economy leading to reduced income disparities and a labour market characterized by effective collecting bargaining, an equitable system of rights, active policies to address employment patterns and stability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The document acknowledges the centrality of job creation, which form one of the most important underlying principles of its five-year programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry points out that &quot;principally, economic progress is measured by the economy's ability to create jobs and to produce commodities and services capable of meeting the increasingly demanding requirements of the domestic and international markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But job creation is also key in the process of deepening democracy.  This is recognized in the RDP White Paper, which makes a clear reference to an &quot;equitable system of rights&quot; within the framework that aspires to full employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Labour Ministry makes a similar observation, saying: &quot;Democracy cannot be attained if sectors of the population are denied access to employment at adequate remuneration and in acceptable conditions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent statistics compiled for the RDP Ministry suggest that the task of job creation will require a momentous effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Various research finding into unemployment suggest that not a single job has been created in the formal sector in the last decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between 1989 and 1992 alone, 286,000 jobs were said have been lost in the non-agricultural sectors of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This disastrous record is made worse by the fact that a very small number of new job seekers entering the labour market have actually been able to find employment in the formal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While statistics have been unreliable, economists have stated quite confidently in recent estimates that the gap between the number of people requiring employment and sectors that can provide jobs have been increasing rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the capacity of the economy to create new employment has been deteriorating rapidly since the 1980's, with some areas more seriously affected than others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the statistics quoted by the RDP ministry, unemployment ranges as high as 47 percent in the Northern Transvaal province to almost 30 percent in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Except for the Free State and the Western Cape, all other provinces are currently labouring under the burden of unemployment rates higher than 30 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both long and short-term programmes will be undertaken by the ministry to realize the objectives of employment creation spelt out in the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end, its five-year plan serves to: elaborate short-term programmes designed to draw unemployment workers into meaningful employment; focus close attention on strengthening and refocusing available vocational counseling programmes in the labour department and the private sector; mandate a Comprehensive Labour Market Commission (CLMC) to examine the role of national policy and institutions in the determination of wages and other incomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the short term, the Labour Ministry will have to focus attention on the National Public Works Programme, currently being run by the Department of Public Works, especially in the are of regulating labour standards and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the tasks the Labour Ministry will undertake in relation to this is to convene a meeting of all stakeholders to discuss issues relating to establishing a regulatory framework.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More direct involvement by the labour ministry could come through other job creation schemes. One scheme which the five-year plan alludes to is a wage subsidy scheme, which it says has to be investigated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was tried by the apartheid government when it linked its decentralization incentives to wage subsidies. But the exercise turned out to be extremely costly in view of the corruption that set in with the implementation of the subsidy scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But these short term programmes, the five-year plan says, will have to supplemented with longer term projects, which are rooted in sound macro-economic and labour market policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It points out that &quot;sustained economic well-being is rooted in the ability of our producers, be they in mining, manufacturing or service sectors to respond to the demands of both the domestic and international markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And at the international level, South Africa's obligations under that Gatt agreement to gradually remove protectionist trade barriers will demand that the country improves its overall performance in the production of goods and services traded on the global market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry sees an important role for itself in this regard and say the CLMC will have to examine the role of national policy and institutions involved in productivity improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It says in its five-year plan that &quot; the cornerstone of our approach to productivity enhancement is that labour should be viewed not as a cost to be minimized but as an asset whose full potential should be realized.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is against the backdrop of this overarching philosophy, which in itself departs radically from that of the past government and even of business, that the five-year programme devotes a considerable amount of emphasis to, among other things, eliminating discrimination in the labour market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It makes the point, for example, that the South African labour market is highly distorted along racial lines. &quot; The consequence of deliberate and systematic policies of apartheid and other forms of discrimination can be seen at almost every South African workplace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Certain sectors of the population have been deliberately excluded from among other things, certain job categories and training opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first step in its attempt to correct his imbalance, the ministry hopes to, as part of its five-year programme, produce a discussion paper on affirmative action in a matter of months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, says the ministry, will be a product of discussions and workshops involving all the social partners, (government, business and labour) as well as the interest groups, including those representing women and the disabled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mboweni's plan also places considerable emphasis on underpinning the capacity of human resources by strengthening and refocusing training and education policies and practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It notes with concern that &quot;South Africa currently lacks the necessary skills required to meet effectively the needs of expanding domestic and international markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the context of increasing globalization of the economy, competition hinges on improved productivity, technological advancement, beneficiation of raw materials and skills development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this must be deployed towards developing a human resources capacity to drive the development of a growing and internationally competitive economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end, the Labour Ministry's five-year plan hopes to implement a training and human resource development policy which should: produce a flexible and skilled workforce, generate capacity for international competitiveness, promote productivity and economic growth, social equity and full employment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the five-year plan does not propose a target date, it says it will implement &quot;far-reaching changes&quot; proposed by the multi-partite National Training Strategy Initiative in respect of: an integrated approach to education and training, restructuring of national and industry training boards, developing a national qualifications frame-work and a qualifications authority as well as a skills audit to quantify and assess the skill potential of economically active people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critically important to the success or failure of the ministry's programme will be its labour market policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The five-year plan says the key pillars on which the government's overall economic, social and political policy rests will also form the basis for its comprehensive labour market policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These key pillars, identified in the RDP White Paper, include: worker and union rights; policy formulation; employment creation; productivity enhancement to meet the needs of domestic and international markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But before the ministry even attempts to develop a labour market policy, it will have to address a critical shortcoming--and that is the lack of a reliable statistical data base on key aspects of the labour market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the major problems confronting organizations and agencies in South Africa who have tried to assess trends in employment and wages has been the lack of reliable statistical base.  This has been a consequence of &quot;a dereliction of duty of state agencies responsible for collecting relevant data&quot; economists researching macro-economic policy options for South Africa said in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Estimates of employment in the informal sector for example range from anything between 19.9 percent to 28 percent. Employment figures for the formal sector are said to be only marginally more reliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also no single aggregate wage series available for workers in the formal sector. &quot;Even the data on government sector wages are unreliable,&quot; economists say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless the labour ministry and more broadly government as a whole develops a reliable statistical base and sustains it, any attempt at developing a workable labour market policy will fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A key instrument in the development of the labour market policy is the CLMC, which the ministry has already appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Its task will not be an easy one given that it well have to develop a policy that meets the requirements of the RDP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The core of these objectives includes employment creation, rising average living standards, workers and union rights, industrial democracy and the elimination of discrimination in the labour market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the ministry is aware that these objectives will not be easy to achieve. It says they could only be realized &quot;in a sustained manner if labour market policy is integrated with the requirements of macro-economic instability and poor performance at the workplace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It notes at the same time that macro-economic stability cannot be sustained if it is &quot;simply associated with stagnation and declining living standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Productivity increases therefore have to be reflected in rising average living standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of this demands achieving a critical balance in the labour market, which up to now has simply eluded the South African economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Business consistently argues at wage negotiations that real increases in pay level (above inflation) simply do not contribute to economic stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unions have argued exactly the opposite and consensus remains elusive on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the terms of reference of the commission charged with developing a labour market policy will nevertheless investigate the &quot;development of a institutional framework for integrating the dual requirement of rapid and sustainable economic growth and rising average living standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This will include an investigation of: the potential role of national tripartite institutions in income determination, the appropriate relationship between national income determination and existing wage determination mechanisms, the component elements of a possible national incomes accord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any policy that emerges from such an investigation will have to take into account that there is significant lost ground that needs to be made up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the apartheid era, those responsible for economic policy, while hailing to halt the dramatic decline in employment levels, also failed to ensure adequate growth in real wages for the majority of workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1980, for example, the average rate of growth of real wages for African workers declined dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is reflected in the rapid increase in the number of black people living in poverty. this figure increased from 14.6 million in 1986 to 16.3 million in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But making up this lost ground is not the only difficulty that a new labour market policy will have to address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is also the question of introducing new and untested, in the South African context, mechanisms, which have come up against formidable opposition from among business people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of these relates to the question of a national minimum wage.  Thinking in the democratic trade union, for some time, has supported the view that sustainable economic growth would be impossible if large numbers of workers continue to earn poverty wages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This view, however, will no find support among employers, who have operated within the paradigm which defines labour as a cost that must be reduced to its minimum in the overall equation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the more challenging tasks that the five-year programme sets out for the CLMC in its search for a workable labour market policy, is examining the possibility of a national incomes accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such an accord necessitates some form of an alliance, first between government and organized labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any income accord will be incomplete unless government undertakes to aggressively deliver on its RDP promises, establish a price surveillance authority to investigate price increases and commit itself to using whatever instruments it has at its disposal to control unjustified price increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This will naturally demand co-operation from business, which has traditionally opposed any form of price management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without price control mechanisms, an incomes accord will be meaningless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although not an easy task the CLMC has been given until the end of this year to report back on a labour market policy. The labour ministry hopes to have a White Paper ready by 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever the difficulties in formulating a universally acceptable labour market policy, one this is certain---it will no t be achieved without challenging some of the traditional taboos held by business and the previous government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 1, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Olu Ojewale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> General Sani Abacha's first press interview in his eleven years in government is the new news. Since he assumed power in November 1993, Abacha had addressed the press only once. His CNN interview last week made as much news as what he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although, the dead of stated fielded only questions filed ahead by the reporter and did not permit follow-up ones as part of the ground rules for the interview, what he said has introduced new dimensions to the nation's political crisis especially the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election and the politics of the continued detention of Moshood Abiola believed to have won that election. His answers to the questions on alleged human rights abuse and the coup story were no less important in what has been seen as an attempt to set a new agenda for public discourse.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most important question was who annulled the election? Abacha said the courts did. Said the head of state: &quot;The issue of the annulment of the 1993 election was a judicial decision. It was the judiciary itself that ruled that the election should not hold. Despite that ruling, the election was held, and still the high court ruled that the processing of the elections should stop and that was when that problem started because there was absolute evidence of electoral malpractices that took place during the election and before the election.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As he put it further: &quot;To say that even there was an election and there was a winner of the election is wrong because I remember in only about 14 states out of 30 states, including Abuja, were election results announced.  Before then, a court ordered NEC to stop further processing of the election results.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha denied that his government is repressive. &quot;The issue of repression is completely unfounded. There is nobody that is being held illegally. We have a judiciary system. The rule of law is there and our judiciary is alive to its responsibilities....anybody who is detained is detained through a legal and legitimate means and the due process of law is taking is course,&quot; he said. he insisted that Nigerians have been expressing themselves freely without any harassment by the military and advised that &quot;anybody who feels that his right has been infringed can seek legal redress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha's critics are up in arm. Taiwo Akeju, publicity secretary of NADECO, Oyo State branch, said: &quot;It was an open secret that the military annulled the election,&quot; which he said still creates a &quot;serious political and economic tension in the country.&quot; Akeju said former President Ibrahim Babangida annulled the election and that Abacha, who was a member of tat regime made last Tuesday's statesmen in a desperate attempt to &quot;seek international support and recognition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Akeju disagreed with Abacha's claim that the election was marred by malpractices, pointing out that it was adjudged free and fair by Humphrey Nwosu, chairman of the defunct National Electoral Commission NEC, Omo Omoruyi, former director of Centre for Democratic Studies, CDS, as well as international observers who monitored the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chuwuemeka Ezeife, former governor of Anambra State, took a similar view saying the annulment of the June 12 election was not a judicial decision. He blamed the military for the action and wondered why it took the Abacha government almost two years to convince itself of that statement.  &quot;Perhaps, they want us to go to court and ask it to de-annul the election or, if possible, appeal against the decision,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bolanle Gbonigi, the Anglican Bishop of Akure diocese, said it was obvious that the military annulled the election. He warned that &quot;until we go back to June 12, there will be no peace for this country and any peace that we are experiencing will be for some time because it would be an unjust peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former civilian governor in one of the western states, who wanted not to identified, accused Abacha of passing the buck for the political crisis in the country to the courts whose powers to adjudicate on the issue were taken away by decrees with ouster clauses. He cited Decree 50 of 1993 which barred the courts from entertaining any suet challenging the annulment of the June 12 presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obi Ogbuitepu, Lagos based lawyer, told &quot;News watch&quot; last week that it was the government which barred the courts from hearing the case when NEC appealed against the decision of an Abuja high court to stop further announcement of the election results. &quot; This was a government and not a court decision,&quot; Ogbuitepu argued. He pointed out that a presidential election tribunal was already set up to entertain any complaints arising from the elections but that the executive action annulling the elections aborted this process. He argued that if there were electoral irregularities the candidates and not the government should have complained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ben Amanze Omoha, another lawyer said &quot;the head of state's comments were insults to Nigerians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another issue in the interview that raised dust was Abacha's claim that there was no human rights abuses. Akeju disagreed saying: &quot;There are indeed terrible and serious human rights abuses in Nigeria today more than we have ever witnessed in the history of the country.&quot; he said notable NADECO members like Frank Kokori, Wariebi Agamene, former secretary and president of National Union of Petroleum and Energy Workers, NUPENG, Ademola Adeniji-Adele, former chairman, Lagos Island local government and Ayo Opadokun, national publicity secretary of NADECO, Olu Akerele, Sylvester Odio, Fred Eno who were arrested and detained since last year are still to be released. Akeju said most of them have been in detention for more than nine months without trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Constitutional Rights Project, CPR, a human rights group, was particularly irked by the head of state's claim that there were no human rights abuses in the country saying it had a list of abuses. Babatunde Olugboji, the publicity officer of the CPR, argued that Abacha's statement was not a true reflection of the country's state of affairs. He said the government had rendered the judiciary ineffective by the promulgation of various decrees to oust the jurisdiction of the courts in many cases, especially on issues bordering human rights. Said he: &quot;Today, by virtue of Decree 12 of 1994, Abacha has acquired absolute powers to do as he pleases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha also took some knocks for his standpoint that Abiola's continued detention was a judicial rather than a political matter. Last week, Anthony Enahoro, an elder statesman, said: &quot;The decision to prosecute in this case is not a matter for the courts&quot;. He argued further: &quot;In the Nigerian experience, particularly in what may be broadly referred to as political cases, it is not even a matter for the attorney-general or ministry of justice. It is and has always been a matter for the political executive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Thursday, Tochukwu Onwugbufor, solicitor-general requested the Supreme Court to grant him &quot;enlargement of time&quot;, to enable him file his brief of argument on Abiola's bail appeal before it. He argued in a 15-point affidavit that he could not file his brief of argument because he traveled to the United States, US, in the middle of last month, adding that his secretary did not draw his attention to the file on the case until after he returned from America on March 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Godwin Ajayi, SAN, Abiola's leading counsel who cited many legal authorities to show that Onwugbufor was wasting time and causing unnecessary delay, described the government lawyer's action as &quot;deliberate and inexplicable.&quot; He said the federal government had failed to prosecute the case &quot;with due diligence&quot;, urging the court not to grant any more time. He said the affidavit deposed to by the government did not comply with the evidence act, adding that where an affidavit runs counter to the evidence act such an affidavit had failed and must be rejected outright. Ajayi, therefore, called on the Supreme court to throw away the affidavit and proceed with the hearing of the substantive matter of Abiola's appeal before it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in their unanimous ruling read by Mohammed Bello, chief justice of the federation on behalf of four other justices, the court granted the prayers of the government counsel to allow an extension of time. The court agreed that there was a delay on the part of the government counsel but blamed it on the junior counsel in the ministry whom Mohammed said did not bring the file on the case to the notice of the solicitor-general to enable government prepare its brief of argument.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It fixed May 18 when Onwugbufor is to argue the preliminary objections raised against the appeal, while June 1 was set aside for the main appeal brought by Abiola against the decision of the appeal court to stay execution of its earlier order, granting him bail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 8, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Mike Akpan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The constitutional conference last Tuesday reversed its last December 6 decision which fixed January 1, 1996, as the terminal date for the Abacha regime. The adoption of last week's motion sponsored by Tony Anenih, former national chairman of the defunct Social Democratic Party, SDP, and 36 others was a major victory for pro-military lobbyists in the constitutional conference who had openly condemned the terminal date as unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They had been unrelenting in campaigning for a 1997 deadline. But last week, they got more than what they even bargained for. The conference not only reversed its earlier decision but gave Sani Abacha, head of state, a blank cheque to determine when to go.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initially, according to &quot;Newswatch&quot; sources, the plan was for the conference to accept the Gemade committee recommendations. This was later dropped because of a strong argument by the government side that the conference had no mandate to fix an exit date would amount to delegates dictating to the federal government. It was then agreed that the motion should merely seek to reverse the December decision without opposition. This was achieved to the shock of the nation because everyone thought the issue had been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conference said it came to the conclusion that the Provisional Ruling Council, PRC, would require enough time to consider, study and adopt the draft constitution as well as its reports and recommendations which include the creation of new states and local governments, power-sharing and federal character, decentralization of the responsibilities of the federal ministries of agriculture and education to states as well as return of federal universities and other higher institutions to their catchment areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lifting of ban on politics and formation of political parties, reconstitution of national and state electoral commissions, electioneering and conduct of general elections to all tiers of government were also sited as time-consuming. In the light of these recommendations, the conference noted that it would be unrealistic to expect the military to conclude its assignments before January 1, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last February, there was an attempt to bring up a similar motion to reverse the terminal date earlier set by the conference. As &quot;Newswatch&quot; reported in its February 20 edition, pro-military conference delegates met in Abuja February 2, to consider a motion presented to them by two former ministers for their signatures. Those who agreed to sign were to be given N250,000 cash. In addition, they were given promises of continuous government patronage which would help to make them political leaders in the various states. Moves to reconvene the conference in mid-February were dropped after the &quot;Newswatch&quot; story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week's motion and the February one have striking similarities.  Both motions argued that the January 1, 1996 terminal date decision had received mixed reactions and outcry from members of the public, majority of whom openly condemned it as &quot;unpracticable, unrealistic and unlikely to have the desired peaceful and purposeful handing over of power to and enduring democracy.&quot; Both argued that the January date was arbitrary and irrational and not based on an implementable programme of action reasonably leading to the proposed terminal date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both motions listed consideration and adoption of the draft constitution by the PRC, promulgation of the new constitution, creation of states and local governments, installation of democratic structures, formation of political parties and electioneering campaigns as items that required enough time to implement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But last week's motion dropped the cancellation of the 1991 census figures and institutionalisation of anti-corruption measures adopted by the conference &quot;which started with careful implementation of the finding of all the probe panels set up by the government&quot; contained in the February motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Tuesday's motion was a big relief to the government which since last December 6 had been campaigning seriously to get the delegates to reverse the January 1, 1996 terminal date. On April 13, Tom Ikimi, the foreign affairs minister, said in his address to the diplomatic community in Lagos that the Abacha regime needed more tome to draw up and successfully implement its transition programme to ensure an enduring democracy in Nigeria. He therefore, saw the January 1, 1996 deadline given to the government to hand over to an elected civilian government as unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adoption of the motion was also a big relief to Adolphus Karibi-Whyte, the chairman, and Olusola Saraki, chairman of the business committee of the conference whom the presidency blamed for mismanaging the December 6 debate and allowing the conference to fix January 1, 1996 as the exit date for the regime. The presidency was to do their home work properly, adding that it was their duty to sell the 24-month transition period proposed by the transition committee to the delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The transition committee headed by Barnabas Gemade, former secretary for works and housing, had argued that a 24-month transition period would enable the tension created by the political crisis of 1993 to die down before elections could be organized successfully. The committee's argument was rejected by the conference. Karibi-Whyte said later that he was embarrassed by the decision although he said as chairman he could not disown it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the presidency was of the opinion he could have saved himself and the government the embarrassment if he had adjourned sitting for one day when he knew the direction of the debate. This, the presidency believed, would have helped government to reach out to the delegates and prevail on them to accept the 24-month period recommended by the committee on transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As soon as the conference decision was relayed to the government, the presidency stated arm-twisting tactics on December 7. Chairmen of the committees on political transition and business were directed to return the cars attached to them. The excuse was that all the vehicles were due for servicing. But Aso Rock sources said it was government's way of saying &quot;enough is enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even then, it was too late to control the direction of the debate. But on December 7, Paulinus Akpeki, a delegate from Delta State, who had strongly spoken against fixing a terminal date for the military, reopened the debate.  He argued that the conference should work out a transition time-table for the military. That suggestion led to yet another round of heated debate on the proposal. Again, it was defeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The issue of a terminal date for the military dogged the regime even before it took office. During the planning stages of the coup which ousted Ernest Shonekan as head of state, there was no firm decision by the coup planners. The idea of a national conference was said to have been accepted as a ploy to prolong military rule. David Mark, a brigadier-general, told &quot;Newswatch&quot; April last year that some of the original planners of the Abacha coup &quot;objected to the fact that the conference was to be used by perpetualists as a delay tactics.&quot; He said if the military followed the original plan to leave office in one year, there would have been no need for the conference. He said the conference was a ploy to keep Abacha in office till 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Events so far have vindicated Mark. During the sitting of the Gemade committee, government agents constantly hovered around the members in order to influence the committee's recommendations. A member of the committee told &quot;Newswatch&quot; last December that on three occasions, a former minister of state who acted as liaison between Abacha and delegates was giving N30,000 to some members, N20,000 to others while some of the members received nothing from him. Some angry members in the committee went to Aso Rock to complain against government's use of intermediary to reach them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To win the support of the transition committee members, the government sold to them the idea that they would play a role in the transition programme. The members fell for the idea and recommended that the constitutional conference and a body of other eminent Nigerians should meet once every three months to advise Nigerians on the direction of the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The committee arrived at its decision based on three proposals. The first proposal favoured a complete civilian transition government to last for five years, another wanted a military government for between one to four years while the third suggested a diarchy which should last for between one and two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delegates chose a diarchy whose partnership would embrace the military, the constitutional conference and or a body of selected eminent Nigerians. In the partnership, the military was to run the government while the conference and the body of selected eminent Nigerians were to monitor and supervise the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Again, the recommendations were rejected by the conference. Anenih who sponsored last week's motion had argued then that the conference delegates would have gone beyond their mandate if they become part of the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Worried by the posture of the conference on recommendations of its transition committee, the presidency set up two lobby groups last December to work on the pro-January 1, 1996 exit date delegates at the conference. The lobby groups were unable to penetrate the pro-January 1, 1996 camp owing tot he towering influence of Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, a retired major-general and a delegate from Katsina State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His arrest and detention in March this year for alleged political activities left the camp without a formidable leader. This made it possible for the lobby groups to penetrate the camp and win over many of his supporters. Those who refused to be won over remained indifferent in order not to risk arrest and detention. The biggest catch the lobby groups made was the conversion as a strong Yar'Adua loyalist. Anenih also succeeded in rallying other Yar'Adua supporters to the side of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was possible for the motion to get an easy passage at the conference last Tuesday because some ardent proponents of the 1996 terminal date were persuaded to stay away. A s a result, Alex Ekwueme, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu and others were aviodably absent. Other hardliners like Sam Mbakwe, Ango Abdullahi, Abdulazeez Farouk, Abubakar Atiku, Nduka Umoke and J.C. Ogbonaya, who attended the session appeared indifferent to the motion either out of fear of intimidation or because they yielded to the persuasion of the lobby groups not to do anything to hinder the smooth passage of the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt last week that there were many trade-offs between some delegates and the government to ensure an early passage of the motion.  For example, southern delegates were lured into supporting the motion in exchange for government's intervention to stop further debate on rotational presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another carrot the government dangled before some delegates was the creation of states and local governments. Most of the delegates who supported the motion are from areas asking for new states and more local governments. A promise by government to grant their demands bought their support for the motion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Part of the deal may have to do with new moves to secure the release of Moshood Abiola, detained for declaring himself president June 11 last year. &quot;Newswatch&quot; learnt some delegates supported the motion after extracting a promise that government would release Abiola. Already the peace brokers have asked Abiola's family and associates not to make any further press statements in order not to jeopardize the new moves. An interview Kudirat, Abiola's wife, granted a magazine due for publication this week had to be pulled out on her request. A presidency source said government may order Abiola's release to appease his supporters as well as the United States and Europe in order to gain their support for the new decision of the conference.  Another presidency source dismissed that feeling last week as speculative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before last week's decision, the conference had begun to undo the 1996 exit date. Scheduled to have concluded its deliberations since October last year, the conference proceeded on three breaks between October and last week thus delaying debates and recommendations on many issues before it. Even when debates on certain issues started, they were allowed to drag on unnecessarily. One of such was the issue of rotational presidency as a permanent or transitional feature in the constitution which nearly stalled the conference. But the conference last week adopted the draft constitution without further debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Akpeki said the failure of the conference to complete its job within the four months earlier stipulated made the January 1, 1996 date impossible. Ali Sheriff, a delegate from Borno State, welcomed last Tuesday's decision of the conference saying the reversal was &quot;in the best interest of the country.&quot; He argued that the military needed time to conclude their yet-to-be announced transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But other conference delegates insisted that is was dangerous to give the military an open-ended programme. Barnabas Baba from Kaduna State argued that it was proper for the conference to draw up a transition programme for the military. He said the new conference decision could give the military a license to implement its transition for the next 50 years. Uzodinma Nwala from Imo State, said the conference decision was likely to create credibility problems for the delegates. He said the conference should have rather than reversing its earlier decision maintained a dignified silence on the terminal date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside the conference, critics said the manner the motion was handled suggested that the decision was predetermined. Eme Awa, a professor and former chairman of the National Electoral Commission, NEC, said the delegates had proved cynics right that the conference was set up to work for the prolongation of military rule. &quot; I am not surprised by what the delegates had done. It confirms my belief that those who think the military can give us democracy are day-dreaming,&quot; he said. The Constitutional Rights Project, CRP, said in a statement last week that the decision had confirmed fears that the conference was set up to be easily manipulated by the military junta to prolong its rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Karibi-Whyte, tried hard to defend the volte face of the conference last week. When he met Pierre Gargigue Guyonn Aud, the French ambassador, in Abuja last Wednesday, Karibi-Whyte explained that the reversal of the December 6 decision was to correct an earlier error made by the conference.  He said the conference went beyond its mandate last year by fixing a terminal date for the military regime. According to him, the new resolution &quot;does not purport to give the military a blank cheque.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Smarting under last week's victory, the pro-military delegates made another move to push forward the date of the submission of the draft constitution to the government from June 9 proposed by the chairman to June 27 on coincide with the inaugural date of the conference. Justifying the decision, the pro-military lobbyists argued that it was better for the conference to give the agency saddled with the printing of the document more time than for the conference to set a date that may be later be postponed.  They had their way when the conference adjourned indefinitely last Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The move has confirmed an earlier story by &quot;Newswatch&quot; that part of the strategy to give the military an extension of tenure is to delay the submission of the draft constitution till late June when it would therefore make no sense for the government to start its transition programme in mid-year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Apparently satisfied with its scheming, the federal military government said last Thursday that it would respect the decisions of the conference and consider them in the interest of the nation. Oladipo Diya, a lieutenant-general and chief of general staff, said when he met members of Club Abuja '94 in his office that the government was satisfied with the decisions of the conference which he described as a resounding success especially against the backdrop of the initial skepticism with which some Nigerians viewed its takeoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the government was is a jubilant mood throughout last week, some Nigerians have already stated to nurse their fears on the likely fall-outs of the conference decision to prolong military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is not doubt that external pressure on the regime would increase. Already, Trans Africa, and Afro-American lobby group in the US, has intensified its campaign to force the Abacha regime to accelerate its democratic process. Randall Robinson, its executive director, said in the CNN interview last Thursday that the Clinton administration was already reviewing its policies on the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last December the administration reinforced its decision to make thing difficult for Nigeria to receive its assistance and any from the World bank and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, by renewing its directives to officials to veto any request made to it or the two bodies. Trans Africa is actively campaigning for economic and diplomatic sanctions against Nigeria and is currently persuading the US not to buy Nigeria's crude oil. The US is a major consumner of Nigerian crude oil. It also want Nigeria's assets in that country to be frozen until the country returns to democracy. If that happens, the national economy will be severely hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angry with the development in Nigeria, the US is reportedly exerting pressure on members of the European Union, EU, to enforce the sanctions they imposed on Nigeria in 1993. Conscious of the effects of economic and diplomatic sanctions, the government has started its diplomatic offensive by sending emissaries to explain the political situation to its audience in Europe and America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, Abacha gave his first ever press interview to the CNN and used that opportunity to dismiss allegations that his regime was deliberately frustrating democratic processes in the country. He told the world that his government was committed to an orderly hand over to a democratically elected government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interview was a follow-up to Ikimi's address to the diplomatic community in Lagos. His speech was designed to sell the October 1997 deadline earlier canvassed by the government to the foreign envoys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the speech, some of the envoys were quoted as saying their home governments would have no option but support the conference decision and that is the government wanted their support, it must get the conference to change the January 1996 terminal date earlier fixed by it. This assurance spurred the government into intensify its pressure on the conference delegates to re-open the exit date issue. it was not clear last week whether the open ended tenure given to the Abacha regime would still enjoy the support of the foreign envoys going by their earlier assurance to stand by the decision of the conference on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the International Centre Against Censorship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excerpts from Report</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Introduction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech to mark the New Year, President Daniel arap Moi announced the opening of a process of debate and amendment of Kenya's Constitution in 1995. The announcements was widely welcomed, including by President Moi's political critics and by human rights activists, who have long argued that the Constitution gives the President excessive powers and needs to brought into line the new multi-party political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, the Constitution already guarantees freedom of expression in Section 79: &quot;Except with his own consent, no person shall be hindered in the enjoyment of freedom of expression, that is to say, freedom to hold opinions without interference, freedom to receive ideas and information without interference, freedom to communicate ideas and information without interference (whether the communication be to the public generally or to any person or class of persons) ... .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unfortunately, as the actions of the Kenyan authorities in the last weeks of 1994 and the early weeks of 1995 show, without urgent institutional and legal reform, constitutional safeguards alone will not protect fundamental rights. Among the attacks on freedom of expression in recent weeks have been the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government denunciations of Kenya's main daily newspaper, &quot; The Nation,&quot; including a threat to close it down. This was followed by the dismissal of critical &quot;Nation&quot; journalists. On 1 February 1995, the independent magazine, &quot;Finance,&quot; was the victim of an arson attack. Later that month, the government banned all past, present and future issues o f &quot;Inooro,&quot; a Kikuyu-language weekly newspaper run by the Catholic Church.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An announcement by the Minister of Information that the government does not intend to grant licenses for private broadcasting, irrespective of the findings of a government-appointed task force which is currently reviewing a broadcasting company leave to sue the Minister for contempt of court, resulting in the application being withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forced removal, without any public notice, of several thousand people already displaced by political violence in the Rift Valley--violence which is widely alleged to have been orchestrated by the ruling party to disrupt the opposition. This was followed by a new upsurge of violence and the arrest of six opposition party officials and Members of Parliament (MPs) when they tried to attend a church service for the victims, one of whom remains in detention on charges of sedition. In March, the government charged another opposition MP with sedition in relation to remarks he allegedly made at a rally in the Central Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Police opened fire at a peaceful event to commemorate the anniversary of the death of opposition leader Jaramogi Oginga Odinga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mwangaza Trust, a body established in 1994 as a policy think-tank on constitutional, human and other issues, was deprived of its legal registration by the Attorney-General in January 1995. Ironically, given the President's New Year speech, the Mwangaza Trust had been one of the main advocates of constitutional reform. In February 1995, another non-governmental group, the Centre for Law and Research International (CLARION) was banned after it released a detailed report on corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sheikh Khalid Balala, a leading Islamic critic of the government, was deprived of his Kenyan citizenship while he was traveling out of country. I the Islamic Party of Kenya, of which he is a member, continues to have its registration refused by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Koigi wa Wamwere, a former MP and the founder of a human rights organization, and three other people are on trial for their lives in a Nakuru magistrates' court. They are alleged to have launched an armed raid on the police station--charges which appear to have been fabricated. The trial has been in progress since April 1994. If convicted, the four men face a mandatory death sentence. Other people associated with the four accused have also been charged with similar offenses, which carry the death penalty, and some have been tortured in custody. The second half of this report consists of a review of the Koigi wa Wamwere case based upon two trial observation missions conducted by Article 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conclusion and Recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This report represents a far from complete roll call of suppression of information, harassment, detention, false charges, torture and ill-treatment of government critics by the Kenyan government. Through these actions, the government has severely circumscribed multi-party politics in Kenya. Yet, in a London stopover as part of an investment tour of Western European countries in November 1994, President Moi was anxious to promote the image of a government committed to multi-party politics, stating that &quot;we have embraced the (multi-party) system fully&quot;. The following month, the Kenyan government promoted this image to donor countries at the Consultative Group for Kenya meeting in Paris. At that meeting, donor countries pledged US $800 million in aid to Kenya, despite continuing concern about human rights abuses. Since then, there has been a marked shift in the Kenyan government's rhetoric and its use of repressive tactics against those whom it perceives as its opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's attitude to the politically motivated violence in the Rift Valley has become ever more entrenched. At the Consultative Group for Kenya meeting in mid-December, many donor governments said that they felt the Kenyan government had improved its handling of the displaced communities and cited this as an important factor in their renewal of aid to Kenya. Since then, however, the government has forcibly dispersed thousands of victims of the political violence, without even consulting the UNDP, its official partner in the resettlement process. On 25 February 1995, the authorities refused to allow an opposition parliamentary team to deliver aid to victims of the violence in the Rift Valley and even detained the US Ambassador, Aurelia Brazeal, on suspicion that she was accompanying the team. A t the same time, the ruling KANU party adopting similar tactics to those used in the Rift Valley in order to divide the Muslim community in the Coastal Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Moi's rhetoric against his critics and opponents has become more pronounced. He has accused unnamed diplomats of interfering in Kenya's internal affairs, apparently in a reference to renewed expressions of concern by foreign diplomats about his government's human rights record, including its failure to reform the country's broadcasting laws. He has openly accused the opposition of planning guerrilla warfare and has warned that he will not tolerate any criticism of the Presidency. In February 1995, yet another opposition MP, Linus Oloch Polo, was arrested and charged with sedition on the basis of remarks he allegedly made about the President.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has also revived its use of arbitrary banning powers to silence its critics--a practice it had previously abandoned in favour of more subtle methods. Since January 1995, it has banned &quot;Inooro,&quot; the Catholic Church weekly and two non-governmental organizations, the Mwangaza Trust and CLARION. Shortly before, CLARION had published a report on official corruption, funded by the Danish Embassy in Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trial of Koigi wa Wamwere, Charles Kuria Wamwere, James Maigwa and G G Njuguna Ngengi has been marked by a shameful catalogue of abuses; yet the government apparently feels confident that it can ignore international pleas for justice in the case with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are some real grounds for concern that some members of the international donor community may have been lulled into a sense of complacency by the move towards a multi-party system in Kenya and that this is being cynically exploited by the Kenyan government to further strengthen its political position. Since 1991, when the withdrawal of foreign aid to Kenya forced the government to concede the introduction of a multi-party system, little has changed either in the government's hostility to freedom of expression or in its disregard for the fundamental rights of its people.  Multi-partyism has not been accompanied by the kind of institutional and legal reform which is essential to underpin democratic development. In the absense of reform, as this report demonstrates, temporary improvements in human rights performances are an inadequate measure against which to judge a government's human right record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 19 calls on the international community to renew pressure on the Kenyan government in order to prevent further human rights abuses and to ensure that the necessary reform of the law and practice relating to freedom of expression is urgently undertaken. The international community has a duty to act whenever and wherever fundamental human rights are abused. Now is the time for complacency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Recommendations&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 19 calls on the Kenyan Governments to implement the following recommendations in order to protect the fundamental right to freedom of expression and information:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Media and Political Violence in the Rift Valley&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allow journalists to carry out their profession free from threats and harassment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rescind the banning order on &quot;Inooro&quot;, which was imposed in February 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ensure that the arson attack on &quot;Finance&quot; magazine in February 1995 is fully investigated and that those responsible are brought to justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Implement the recommendations contained in Article 19's January 1995 report to the Media Task Force on broadcasting by establishing an independent system to issue broadcasting licenses and ending government control of the publicly-funded Kenya broadcasting Corporation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ensure that an independent public investigation is held into the cause of violence in the Rift Valley and that those responsible are brought to justice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ensure that journalists, human rights activists and others can freely visit, investigate and report on the situation in the Rift valley, and cease the harassment of those who speak out about human rights abuses in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ensure that displaced people and those organizations which work with them are fully informed and consulted about resettlement plans and about the situation in their home areas before resettlement takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Freedom of Association&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allow CLARION and the Mwangaza Trust to resume their activities, free from intimidation and amend the law on freedom of association to ensure that organizations cannot be banned because of the peaceful political activity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allow opposition political party activists and MPs to hold meeting without harassment, and amend legal provisions which require permits for meeting to ensure that these cannot be applied in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner to ban peaceful political gatherings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Allow the IPK to register as a political party and to operate freely, and return Kenyan citizenship to Sheikh Khalid Balala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;False charges, prison conditions, and torture&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediately release all those who have been detained on false charges, including Koigi wa Wamwere, Charles Kuria Wamwere, James Maigwa and G G Njuguna Ngengi, and cease the practice of bringing false criminal charges against human rights activists and government critics on account of their peaceful activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Investigate all allegations of torture an ill-treatment in custody, bring those responsible to justice and compensate the victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ensure that the treatment of prisoners meets the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the treatment of Prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Review laws governing the conduct of trials in Kenya to ensure that they meet the fair trial requirements of international human rights law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by the International Centre Against Censorship</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Press Statement, April 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 19 calls for renewed international pressure on the Kenyan government to halt flagrant human rights abuses according to &quot;Censorship in Kenya: Government Critics face the Death Sentence&quot;, Article 19's new report released today (3 April).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report concludes that without urgent legal and institutional reform, multi-party politics has little practical impact in Kenya. Opposition politicians are harassed and prevented from holding meeting with their constituents; the government continues its tight control of the most important mass media, radio, and television; and those who speak out against the government face harassment, detention, false charges and even torture.  The Islamic Party of Kenya continues to be banned and Article 19 fears that the ruling KANU party, using similar tactics to those used in the Rift Valley, is attempting to sow dissension among the Muslim community in the Coast Province.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report also reviews the government's human rights record since Kenya's international aid donors pledged US $800 million to Kenya in December 1994. Article 19 fears that Kenya's aid donors have slackened pressure for real change and substantial human rights reform. In the absence of such reform, human rights violations continue, as the following cases demonstrate:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The forced dispersal of thousands of people displaced by the Rift Valley violence in late December 1994. In response to international criticism, the government stopped this practice and, in March, withdrew security regulations in the Rift Valley area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bannings of publications and organizations critical of the government.  Since January 1995, the government has banned two non-governmental groups, CLARION and the Mwangaza Trust, as well as a weekly newspaper, &quot;Inooro&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Continuing abuses in the protracted trial of Koigi wa Wamwere and others who face the death penalty on charges of attempted armed robbery.  Article 19 concludes that the accused are undergoing an unfair trial on false, politically-motivated charges, based on fabricated evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alarmingly, violent attacks by unknown assailants have also increased.  In February, the offices of the independent &quot;Finance&quot; magazine were set on fire. The following month, the Legal Aid Centre was forced to close after being repeatedly petrol-bombed. In the last attack, the assailants shot two security guards and fired on people who tried to intervene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frances D'Souza, Article 19's Executive Director commented:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Article 19 calls for the withdrawal of the charges against Koigi wa Wamwere, Charles Kuria Wamwere, James Maigwa and GG Njuguna Ngengi, whose trial has been marked by a catalogue of abuses. The government has refused to withdraw the ill-founded charges against the four, arguing that this would be an interference in the judicial process. But by pursuing these charges the government has itself undermined the reputation and standing of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has shamefully exploited both ethnic divisions and legal mechanisms to undermine multi-party politics in Kenya. The international community must take every opportunity to press the Kenyan government to implement legal and institutional reforms which guarantee freedom of expression and other fundamental rights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 17, 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four members of the House of Representatives have taken the initiative to ask their colleagues to sign a letter in support of aid to Africa, to be sent to the chairpersons of the relevant committees that are considering the budget this month and in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four are Amo Houghton (R-NY), Gary Ackerman (D-NY), Doug Bereuter (R-NE), and Donald Payne (D-NJ).  Other members of Congress have recently received an invitation to become co- signers.  In communicating with your member of Congress concerning aid to Africa, one concrete measure you can urge on them is to sign on to this letter by contacting the offices of Rep.  Houghton or Rep. Ackerman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draft text of the letter as sent out by the four members is as follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this time of diminishing resources, the American people are demanding improved fiscal responsibility and sound spending choices that are consistent with American principles.  We are, therefore, concerned that current proposals to cut foreign aid, especially development assistance to Africa, misrepresent the will of the American people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One sound spending choice would be to maintain the Development Fund for Africa as a separate account at a funding level sufficient to foster sustainable development. Disproportionate or severe cuts will undermine this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As you know, Africa is a continent in crisis -- conflict, famine, environmental degradation and debt burdens beset many nations.  These crises too often overshadow the nations on the continent where progress toward democracy and economic growth have greatly improved the context for and impact of U.S. assistance.  But Africa is also facing opportunity.  Now is not the time to pull back.  Now is the time to shift emphasis, promote self-help development, peaceful resolution of conflicts and debt reduction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Development Fund for Africa and the African Development Foundation have contributed to Africa's gains in health care, educational opportunities and small business development.  As a result, in our minds, it is in the U.S.  national interest to assist African nations.  Africa is the last great development frontier, a potentially significant partner in world trade.  Investments in Africa's people -- to help them meet their basic needs, increase their incomes, develop their infrastructure, participate in decisions and resolve conflicts -- are essential to creating an environment for the fair trade and investment opportunities that will lead to sustained economic and social progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. assistance can also help address war and debt, two major obstacles to development in Africa.  By providing resources to African organizations engaged in mediating conflicts, the U.S. can support African solutions to African problems.  And by forgiving some of the debt owed to the U.S., we can help African nations devote more resources to education and health care and create a better environment for economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maintaining effective aid programs for Africa with a level adequate to meet both the needs and the opportunities is in our national interest.  We therefore asks that these programs not be signaled out to carry a severe or disproportionate share of the program cutbacks needed to meet the commitment to reducing the federal budget.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 1995</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Olara A. Otunnu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Representatives, Ladies and Gentlemen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As on previous occasions, once again I feel very honored to have been asked to address the United Nations Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations at its 1995 session. The work of this Committee has always been very important, but never more so than today. The mandate of your Committee has assumed special significance in recent years because, on the one hand, peacekeeping and related activities have become perhaps the most important single area of preoccupation for the United Nations and, on the other, because the evolution of these activities is now caught in the midst of a critical historical crossroads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I propose to divide my remarks into two parts. In the first part, I will provide a brief overview of recent IPA activities, those with a direct bearing on the work of this Committee. The second part of my remarks will be largely an exercise in stock-taking. I will outline some key issues for consideration by this Committee in the context of improving and strengthening the peaceand-security activities of the United Nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are five areas of recent IPA program activities on which I should like to update the Committee, namely Policy Training Seminars; Policy Symposia; Research Program; Facilitation of Conflict Resolution; and Africa Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IPA organizes and conducts a number of policy training seminars on peacekeeping and conflict resolution. The sessions are generally of one to two weeks' duration. Participants in these seminars are drawn from the senior ranks of diplomats, military officers, members of the UN Secretariat as well as the Secretariats of regional organizations and officials of humanitarian organizations. The seminar program is designed to fulfill three inter-related objectives: first, todeepen the knowledge and expertise of participants on critical policy issues relating to peacekeeping and peacemaking; second, to provide opportunities for comparing various national and regional experiences; and third, to provide a setting for networking amongst participants coming from different parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Vienna Seminar, the flagship of our seminar program. We are proud to count many of the distinguished representatives on this Committee amongst the alumni of the Vienna Seminar. The Paris Seminar has a particular importance. for us as one of the few French-language international seminars of its kind. I am pleased to announce that plans are now underway to launch two new training seminars.  We plan to organize, here in New York, an annual seminar primarily for the benefit of members of the Permanent Missions and the staff of the UN Secretariat; the inaugural session for this seminar is scheduled for later this year. In addition, at the request of the eleven states of Central Africa and pursuant to UN General Assembly Resolution A.49/76C of last year, IPA has accepted to organize a special Frenchlanguage seminar program focusing on trainers and on peacekeeping preparedness for the states of the sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years, IPA has developed a tradition of organizing policy symposia of two or three days duration, which bring together high-level policy-makers from governments and international organizations, scholars, and independent opinion-makers for in-depth policy discussions on an important topical theme (e.g. &quot;Humanitarian Action in Conflict Situations&quot;, Princeton, October 1993; &quot;The Role and Composition ofthe Security Council&quot;, February 1994) or a cluster of cutting-edge issues (e.g. &quot;New Dimensions of United Nations Peace-keeping Operations&quot;, Tokyo, January 1995) relating to peacekeeping and conflict resolution. The policy symposia have two objectives: on the one hand, to provide an occasion for a deeper reflection on the issues in question, and, on the other, to come up with specific insights and recommendations that can be of practical use to policy-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We have organized two important policy symposia since the beginning of this year. In mid-January, we organized in Tokyo, in collaboration with The United Nations University and with the support of the Government of Japan, a symposium on the theme &quot;New Dimensions of United Nations Peace-keeping Operations.&quot; In early March in Vienna, IPA and the Government of Austria jointly sponsored a special high-level symposium on the theme &quot;Peacemaking and Peacekeeping for the Next Century&quot; That symposium was especially organized to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the annual Vienna Seminar and the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. The reports from these two symposia will be ready in May. The discussions in Tokyo and Vienna and their outcomes represent part of IPA's intellectual contribution to the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The purpose of IPA's Research Program has been to monitor and assess UN and other multilateral peace operations with a view to drawing lessons from those experiences for the future. In this connection, we have just completed case studies of the peace processes in Cambodia and El</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salvador. An IPA Occasional Paper on Cambodia (UNPeacekeeping in Cambodia: UNTAC's Civil Mandate, by Michael Doyle) has just been published. A similar occasional paper on El Salvador (&quot;Seeking Peace with Justice: UN Strategies in Fl Salvador&quot;, by Ian Johnstone) will be coming out shortly. An edited volume containing a comprehensive coverage of both the Cambodia and El Salvador cases will be published in early 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the next phase of our research program, in addition to continuing with some case studies, we shall focus especially on the question of preventive action. The idea here is to build a body of theoretical and practical knowledge to help us answer the question: Is conflict prevention possible? Can preventive measures work? And if so, how?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IPA plays a facilitating role in efforts to settle particular conflicts by providing a middle ground where options for political settlements may be explored with the parties in conflict. In shaping this role for the future, we intend to place special emphasis &quot;onprevensive action&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier, in the context of our research program, I spoke of the need to build a body of knowledge, to develop a better understanding, to probe more thoroughly the boundaries of preventive action. I believe that there is a parallel need to build a &quot;body of practice&quot; and experience in the field of preventive action. This means that the UN and other organizations interested in preventive activities should identify particular countries in actual or potential conflict, in effect to 'adopt' particular conflict situations, and work with local parties to apply a selection of preventive measures over an extended period of time. Only through such a strategy of &quot;preventive engagement&quot;, applied over time, can we hope to build a body of practice and experience that will enable us, down the road, to speak with any confidence about preventive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in this spirit that IPA has fommulated a project on preventive action in Burundi as part of our Program on Preventive Action. In a similar way, we are now working to identify one or two other conflict situations to 'adopt' for preventive engagement; these will most likely be from East/Central Europe and from Asia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We at IPA recognize the important role that regional organizations must necessarily come to play in the field of peacemaking and peacekeeping.  But for this to come to pass, no efforts should be spared to assist them to develop their capacities for action more fully. It is in this context that over the last four years IPA has worked closely with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to explore ways in which the pan-Afriean organization can respond more effectively to the drama of conflict on the African continent These efforts have already borne fruit in the adoption, in June 1993, of a new OAU mechanism --- The Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tasks ahead, in many ways more formidable than the formulation of the Mechanism itself, are two-fold. The first task is how to translate the OAU's intent, embodied in the Mechanism, into an instrument that can make a difference on the ground. The second challenge, equally important, is how to build a broad constituency of support within Africa for the OAU Mechanism in particular, and more generally for all efforts aimed at managing conflicts more peacefully on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With these objectives in mind, IPA is currently undertaking two projects in collaboration with the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> i. Task Force on Peace Operations in Africa. The mission of the Task Force is to fommulate a graduated program of practical step-by-step measures for the operationalisation of the OAU Mechanism. This exercise will have to take into account several factors and developments, including recent OAU experience; what the 'political traffic' in Africa can bear at any given moment; the role of the UN; the potential role of sub-regional arrangements in different parts of Africa; and the availability of resources, short and long term within and outside Africa, for this purpose. In this context, in addition to what IPA has built in this area over the last four years, we intend to draw on several very useful initiatives which have been undertaken recently; we welcome, in particular, the report which has just been completed under the joint auspices of the Permanent Missions of the United Kingdom and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ii. IPA/OAU Consultation on Civil Societv and Conflict Management in Africa. This consultation, which will be the fourth in our series of consultations on conflict management in Africa, is scheduled for early next year. It will focus on the role of civil society and other nonofficial actors in conflict management and peace initiatives in Africa, and on how to link these activities to the OAU Mechanism. The consultation is also designed to facilitate networking amongst non-official actors in the field of conflict management in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I shall be meeting this weekend in Addis Ababa with the OAU Secretary General, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, to discuss and plan the next steps in the execution of the projects I have outlined above.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The evolution of UN peacekeeping thus far may be divided into three distinct but closely related phases. During the first phase, the UN developed and practiced what has come to be known as traditional peacekeeping, with its emphasis on consent and cooperation; ceasefire; impartiality; and the non-use of force, except in self-defense. Traditional peacekeeping, which was applied mainly in inter-state conflicts, dominated UN practice for four decades, covering the period from 1948 to about 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the immediate aftemmath of the Cold War, a broader, more ambitious and intrusive notion of peacekeeping emerged. This evolution marked the second phase which has been characterized, amongst others, by increasing UN engagement in a broad range of intra-state conflicts; involvement in the process of national political reconstruction, including supervision of elections and the resuscitation of collapsed state structures; the growth and transformation of humanitarian action; the 'graying' of the vital zone between peacekeeping and enforcement action; and new questions concerning the issue of impartiality. This second phase gained universal currency with the publication by the UN SecretaryBeneral, Dr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, of his seminal paper &quot;An Agenda for Peace&quot; in January 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After several years of extensive engagement and experimentation in multidimensional peacekeeping, the UN has successfully conducted several major operations, such as in Namibia, Cambodia, El Salvador and Mozambique.  At the same time, the Organization has experienced some tragic failures, as evidenced by Somalia, Rwanda, the earlier setback in Angola and the continuing quagmire in the former Yugoslavia. As we look back, what in fact are the &quot;valid&quot; lessons we can draw from these first two phases of UN peace-and-security activities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are signs that the UN may be entering a third phase of peacemaking and peacekeeping, a phase marked by reduced ambition, loss of confidence and a general mood of retrenchment. But the onset of this third phase is still very tentative. It is not yet clear if these signs of retrenchment are a passing phenomenon, an interregnum marking the present period of great uncertainties, or whether we are witnessing an enduring wave of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As this Committee deliberates on the future course of peacekeeping and related activities, I wish to highlight some issues for your consideration in that connection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We all are agreed about the importance of preventive action, even though we know very little in practice about this particular peace activity.  The UN and other international organizations need to invest a lot more in preventive measures; successful preventive action can be highly costeffective, saving lives and sparing general destruction, in addition to being considerably cheaper than a peacekeeping operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That being said, however, let me offer some clarifications concerning this question. First, as I indicated earlier in my remarks, it is critical that we work to build a body of both &quot;serious knowledge and serious pracice&quot; through systematic preventive engagement in specific situations of actual or potential conflict. This will require innovation and long-term commitrnent.  Unless we do this, I fear that preventive action will simply remain an easy and empty slogan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, while we must probe the boundaries of preventive possibilities to the outer limits, we must not lose sight of some serious constraints inherent in this enterprise. How, for example, shall we overcome the shield of national sovereignty, a country's sense of national pride, the temptation for brinkmanship, asymmetry of response amongst parties in conflict, the tendency to misread a developing situation until it is too late, or the lack of interest or will on the part of international actors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, we must not view conflict prevention as the abolition of all conflicts in society. After all, conflict by which I mean competition for power and resources is entirely natural to society. It is the essence of the political process. The challenge of preventive action is different, it is about how to manage this competition without plunging a society into a spiral of violence. It is about how to build patterns of development, institutions, and political cultures that can mediate such competition peacefully and routinely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourthly, by preventive action I am referring to a broad spectrum of activities, going well beyond the traditional notion of preventive diplomacy or the new mechanism of preventive deployment. Preventive action must encompass a broad palette of political, economic, social and humanitarian measures aimed at preventing or de-escalating-the development of conflict and, because of the often circular rather than linear nature of the evolution of conflict, avoiding its recurrence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is clear that the UN is over-extended in terms of resources and capacity to perform well the many tasks it has assumed over the last several years. This situation, which has now reached a critical point, calls for an appropriate division of responsibilities between the UN and other international actors in the spheres of preventive action, peacemaking, peacekeeping, enforcement action and peacebuilding. Such a division of labor could take advantage of the different capabilities and interests of regional organizations, national governments and nongovernmental organizations. A possible division of labor may be developed along the following areas of concentration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> i. The UN. The UN should concentrate its efforts on traditional peacekeeping, mediation, peacebuilding activities, and invest more energy in preventive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ii Sub-contracting to outside coalitions. For the foreseeable future, enforcement action will have to be 'farmed out' to what may be called 'coalitions ofthe willing and able.' In such a situation, the Security Council should, however, not simply authorize the action but also be more closely associated with the execution and the conclusion of the operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When it is envisaged, as was the case in Somalia and Haiti, that the UN should take over a situation following the completion of enforcement action, then this calls for early and adequate preparation for assuming that responsibility. Particular attention needs to be given, for example, to formulating and organizing clear transition arrangements for this purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> iii. Regional Organizations. In time, regional organizations must come to assume greater responsibility for peace and security. Alas, that time is not yet here. Most regional organizations are still far from being able to play the role envisaged for them in Chapter VIII of the Charter, mainly because of their lack of --- relevant tradition, financial resources, political prestige and credibility, impartiality, and operational capacity.  This places a particular responsibility on the United Nations, the major powers, traditional peacekeeping countries, and other bilateral and multilateral donors to work in a concerted manner to help build the capacities of regional organizations. Until then, we must guard against exaggerated expectations. For the time being, the areas of concentration for regional organizations should be preventive action and peacemaking, while allowing for the gradual development of peacekeeping capacities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the emphasis on the role of regional organizations must not lead to a sort of tribalisation of peacekeeping activities, whereby, for example, conflicts in Europe are viewed as the responsibility of the Europeans or African conflicts as the responsibility of the Africans. This notion goes against the grain of the UN--- its universality and worldwide responsibility for maintaining peace and security. Moreover, the problem is compounded by the uneven spread and varying capacities of regional organizations in different parts of the globe. Clearly member states from a particular region should be encouraged to spearhead international response to conflict situations within their region, but this must not detract from the significance of wider international participation in these efforts. This is important for reasons of broader legitimacy and global solidarity, as well as practical reasons of capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> iv. Independent Actors We are witnessing the emergence of independent actors in the general field of peacemaking and peacekeeping. Drawn from the ranks of international civil society, these actors are increasingly making direct contributions to peace processes. On account of its informal and flexible character, this sector can often complement offficial efforts, particularly in the areas of early warning, preventive activities, peacemaking, humanitarian action and peacebuilding. Different independent organizations tend to specialize in various aspects of these activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proliferation of conflicts in many parts of the world, all of which call for some form of UN involvement, stands in sharp contrast to the limited capacity and resources of the Organization. In view of these contradictory pressures, the UN will have to determine more systematically where to get involved, when to get involved and to what degree to get involved. These are questions concerning the &quot;breadth&quot;, the &quot;depth&quot; and the &quot;stage&quot; of UN engagement, which are distinct from the issue of functional priorities (i.e. investment in preventive action, mediation, traditional peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities) discussed earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In general, the UN should invest its political and material resources where they are &quot;needed most&quot; and where they are likely to make the &quot;greatest difference&quot;. Yet the difficulty of formulating any objective criteria for applying such a policy means that decisions will in reality be made on a case-by-case basis. Is there not a danger then that such an ad hoc method of decision-making could become entirely hostage to the fortunes and vagaries of the political process? The challenge for the Security Council in this regard is to apply, and be seen to apply, similar policies in similar situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While selective engagement is perhaps a necessary response to present realities, it also presents a serious moral predicament as a long-term policy. Under selective engagement, conflicts will inevitably fall into two categories: on the one side, those 'adopted' by the UN or other international organizations and, on the other, the ones that are allowed to fall between the cracks of the international system. These latter conflicts would be left to run their own course and would effectively constitute the 'forgotten tragedies' of the world. I wonder, moreover, how long international public opinion could stand by and accept such a spectacle of studied indifference, especially when the international community begins to view media images from the scenes of these tragedies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Enforcement action is war by another name. Thus, before embarking on such action, at least three prerequisites need to be in place: adequate political will, including the will to bear the human cost of the military operation; the will and capacity to assume the necessary financial cost; and the availability of troops adequately prepared and equipped for the task.  This is a tall order. It is for this reason that, for the foreseeable future, it is more practical for the UN to continue to 'farm out' such operations to 'coalitions of the willing and able.' Peacekeeping operations on the other hand must continue to adhere to the traditional principles of consent, impartiality and the non-use of force except in self-defense. Confusion between peacekeeping and enforcement action can be very dangerous. Equally dangerous is the tendency to slide from peacekeeping to enforcement action and then back again to peacekeeping.. This is essentially what unfolded in Somalia and Liberia, with disastrous consequences in both cases. All of this would seem to underscore the need to maintain a clear conceptual and operational separation between enforcement action and peacekeeping operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In doing so, however, we must recognize that recent experience demonstrates that on the ground there is a growing 'gray zone' between traditional peacekeeping and massive enforcement action. This is especially true in situations of internal eonfliet, which has now become the dominant categorv of eonflicts worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let us consider the following scenarios as illustrations of the problems that can arise in the gray zone:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when an armed faction in a eonfliet unilaterally blocks the way, preventing a relief convoy from gaining access to a population in distress;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when a 'safe area' under the protection of the UN is threatened and then attacked by a party in conflict;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> when a peacekeeping contingent comes under a massive attack from a well-armed faction;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Or, the situation in Rwanda in April 1994, following the presidential plane crash, when the massacres started, but before they swelled into a genocidal tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Could a rapid and sharp intervention, perhaps an impressive show of force by a crack unit, have made any difference in Rwanda? It is at least conceivable that such a gesture might have stemmed, if not averted altogether, the genocide that subsequently unfolded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The above scenarios are necessarily rough and somewhat simplified, but they illustrate the variety of situations that can develop in the gray zone.  For this reason, UN peacekeeping forces, particularly in internal eonflict situations, should be adequately prepared for the gradual or sudden deterioration of a situation, possibly into worst case scenarios. They need to have the capacity for escalated armed response, should this become absolutely necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this will require that at least two projects be explored more fully. First, the UN needs to develop clear guidelines regarding the conditions for a more forceful response, including a determination of decision-making responsibilities between the contingent commander on the scene, the overall mission commander, and UN headquarters in New York.  Second, the UN needs to examine more seriously the various ideas on creating some sort of a rapid response capability. A rapid response force could be despatched immediately to a conflict theater in order to avert or minimize the deterioration of the situation to crisis proportions. Intervention of this kind would go beyond traditional peacekeeping, but still fall short (by its scope and duration) of a full-scale enforcement action. This may be one possible way to help fill some of the present gap in the 'gray zone'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace operations, including humanitarian emergencies, have increased by leaps and bounds over the last several years. This development is producing some significant imbalances within the international system. On this occasion, I should like to highlight two areas of imbalance in particular that need to be addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first area of imbalance has to do with the growing tension between peacekeeping operations and development activities. An important disequilibrium is beginning to emerge between resource allocations for peacekeeping and emergency activities, on the one hand, and resources available for long-term peacebuilding on the other. The resources devoted by the UN and by governments to peacekeeping and emergency activities are beginning to outstnp the resources for long-term peacebuilding, in other words resources for development. Indeed, a number of governments and other donor institutions have started to divert resources from their development budgets to peacekeeping operations and humanitarian relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This trend needs to be reexamined --- investing in social and economic development is one of the surest ways to build a solid foundation for long-term peace in a society as well as between societies. In this connection, there is also need to consciously build a conflict management component into the design of development projects. This is especially necessary in countries where the potential for conflict escalation is high, or where a pattern of gross imbalance in the allocation of resources can provide a fertile ground for conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The second area of imbalance concerns the preoccupation with humanitarian action in a conflict situation vis -a-vis the need for a political process. It is important that humanitarian action be located within an overall vision of a society in conflict. This means, in particular, that humanitarian action should move in tandem with a political process aimed at addressing the underlying causes of a conflict and achieving a political settlement. Otherwise I fear that the tremendous and admirable efforts being deployed on the humanitarian front will inevitably count for very little. The experiences of Cambodia, El Salvador and Mozambique represent examples where a combined strategy of humanitarian and political actions was successfully employed. In sharp contrast to this, however, stands the current situation in and around Rwanda (and to a lesser extent the situation in Burundi), where a major humanitarian operation is in place but no comparable concerted efforts are underway to find a political settlement to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dramatic growth in peacekeeping activities has simply not kept pace with the flow of financial resources. Present arrangements for national contributions have come under severe stress, and the on-going review exercise may well result in a reconfiguration of national contributions. I believe, however, that the time has now come to think more boldly and innovatively about ways to generate additional revenues for peacekeeping operations. Why not, for example, consider a direct contribution from members of the international community who, through their activities, tend to benefit disproportionately from a more stable and peaceful international situation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are those who may be considered &quot;general beneficiaries&quot;, like airline travelers or transnational corporations. Why not consider, for example, a contribution to the l)N peacekeeping budget of one dollar per airline ticket this would still be less than the price of a cup of coffee at most airports ! Direct taxation on international financial transactions has been suggested as another possibility in this category. And then there &quot;areparticular beneficiaries&quot;, which include countries like Cyprus, Cambodia, Angola, El Salvador and Mozambique, where there are on-going peace operations or where a credible measure of peace has been restored. Why not explore, as a matter of policy, special contributions from such beneficiary countries, especially those which have an actual or potentially strong revenue base?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to explore these and other options more fully, member states must first be prepared to discard a kind of ideological prejudice surrounding discussion of this matter I refer to the view that contribution to peacekeeping operations should be an exclusive affair of governments. I do not believe that this position can be sustained in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, a word about the need for an information and media strategy.  There is no doubt that the UN has made and continues to make a critical contribution to international security through peacekeeping. Regrettably, this is not widely appreciated outside this house. The practice of peacekeeping as a whole has suffered from the lack of an adequate information and media strategy. A partial and unclear understanding of the nature of peacekeeping, its possibilities and constraints, and of its successes and failures, has resulted in distorted public perceptions. And this in turn is beginning to have a negative impact on national policies towards UN peacekeeping activities. Something must be done to remedy this situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A clearer and more aggressive public infornnation and media strategy by the UN is needed --- a better informed public is likely to be more supportive of UN peace-and-security activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I stated at the opening of my remarks, the evolution of the peace-and-security agenda of the United Nations is caught at a historical crossroads today. This is a time for stocktaking; it must also be a time for sketching, however tentatively, the outlines for a future role into the next century. I am concerned that the UN should not swing from one extreme to another, from being committed to too much to undertaking too little. It is very much my hope that from the present crossroads, there should emerge a well-considered, balanced role for the UN in its mission of maintaining international peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I hope that some of the reflections I have shared with the Committee this morning will be useful in that context. I thank you, Mr. Chairman and distinguished representatives, for giving me this opportunity. I wish you much success in your important deliberations.</SPAN></P>
