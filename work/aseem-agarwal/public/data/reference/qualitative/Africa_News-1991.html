Mervyn Dymally (D-CA) is slated to replace Wolpe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aides say Dymally was urged to take the post by fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally has taken an active interest in various African issues and was an active proponent of the South African sanctions bill adopted in 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dymally has chosen Stan Smith, staff director of the international operations subcommittee the Congressman chaired, to head the Africa subcommittee staff. He will replace Steve Weissman, who directed the staff during Wolpe's chairmanship. Africa policy groups say the departure of the current staff will leave a void on Capitol Hill, where they earned respect for energetic activity on a range of Africa-related issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many African countries have difficulty dealing with wandering peoples who have little regard for national borders, and Malian Touareg have long complained of unfair treatment by the government in the south.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions increased last June and July when Touareg who had been in refugee camps in neighboring countries since the severe droughts of the 1970s began to return to Mali. The returnees demanded a larger share of the impoverished country's development aid. Government officials labeled them &quot;Libyan-trained bandits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Algerian-mediated talks, the government reportedly agreed to give two Touareg areas in northern Mali a special status amounting to &quot;internal autonomy.&quot; Other details of the accord were not released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign ministry in Algiers issued a statement saying that &quot;Algeria rejoices in this happy outcome.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the second time since its independence from Portugal in 1975, Mozambique has abolished the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The abolition took effect on November 30 when a new constitution, which also introduced a multiparty system, came into force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Capital punishment was disavowed by the Frelimo party when it took power from Portugal. But death sentences were reintroduced in 1979 in response to mounting atrocities and terrorist attacks by Renamo rebels. From 1979 to 1986, 78 people were executed, for violent crimes such as murder and terrorism as well as certain economic offenses.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said they hoped the existence of the death penalty would act as a deterrent to crime. But the government never became comfortable with capital punishment, and the penalty has not been used for the last four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambican officials began to say that there was no evidence that the death penalty had prevented terrorism or other offenses. Some argued that executions tarnished Frelimo's historic belief in the possibility of rehabilitation, even for vicious criminals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An editorial last June 13 in the Maputo newspaper Noticias welcomed the absence of a death penalty in the draft constitution that was being circulated for public comment. &quot;We have so short a time to live,&quot; the paper said, &quot;that we should not shorten it any further. Rather, we should teach each other to live better and accept each other in harmony and tolerance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last September, in a speech to an Amnesty International forum in Havana, Judge Abdul Carimo Issa signaled Mozambique's intention to reabolish the death penalty formally. The people of Mozambique, the judge said, believe &quot;that life is an immeasurable good to be preserved in the name of all civilization and the highest values of a society, and that other means can be used to achieve that which capital punishment showed, in practice, that it cannot achieve: peace, harmony, respect for human life and stability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October, the National People's Assembly added article 70 to the draft constitution: &quot;In Mozambique,&quot; it states, &quot;there will be no death penalty.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">480 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The balance of forces in South Africa has &quot;shifted irrevocably&quot; in favor of the African National Congress (ANC) and its allies, ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela said in a major policy statement earlier this month. The white-led government has been &quot;obliged,&quot; Mandela said, to accept &quot;the inevitability of a negotiated resolution&quot; of the country's problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking for the national executive committee of the ANC, Mandela called for convening an all-party congress, drawn from all segments of society, to undertake the constitution-writing process and to oversee the transition to democratic rule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the ANC national consultative conference in mid-December, delegates endorsed a resolution accusing the government of a &quot;deliberate attempt&quot; to &quot;destabilize the ANC and sow terror and chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly after the conference ended, President F.W. de Klerk responded, saying in a nationally televised speech: &quot;We shall not capitulate to radical pressure and we shall not shrink from using all available resources to ensure stability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela pledged the ANC to a &quot;program of liaison with all relevant political organizations,&quot; in order to seek an end to large-scale fighting in the country. He called on all groups, specifically mentioning the Inkatha Freedom Party, led by Gatsha Buthelezi, to cooperate &quot;in good faith to save the lives and property of the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Bantu Holomisa,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">who like Buthelezi heads one of the black homelands created by the government's apartheid policy, said in an interview that he fears that Mandela's appeal to Inkatha will not be heeded, since there are forces inside the government's security apparatus promoting division and distrust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa leads the ruling military council in Transkei, which was the first of the homelands to be given nominal independence by Pretoria in 1976.  Since seizing power in December 1987, he has moved to distance his administration from the government in South Africa and has repealed security laws and other restrictions on free expression. &quot;Transkei has been a catalyst in the change that is taking place in South Africa,&quot; Holomisa says. &quot;We introduced dramatic changes even before Mr. de Klerk announced his reform program and released Mr. Mandela in February.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa says the Transkei is now well-placed to promote unity among competing political movements, particularly the two largest and oldest organizations, the ANC and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC). Only in the Transkei have leaders of these two groups come together and jointly addressed mass rallies, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he is ready to represent Transkei in any all-party meeting, Holomisa firmly rejects any idea that the territory could or should remain separate from the rest of South Africa. &quot;I see no future for any homeland; they are neither economically nor politically viable,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEBY TAKEOVER USHERS OUT LIBYAN &quot;CONTRAS'</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1022 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A sensitive American intelligence operation directed against Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi was apparently aborted last month by the unexpectedly swift seizure of power in Chad by Idriss Deby. Deby and his Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) swept into the capital N'Djamena on December 1, sending President Hissein Habre fleeing for his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situated in the center of northern Africa and bordering seven other nations, Chad has been the focus of an international scramble involving the United States, France, Libya, and several other African nations. But neither France -- with 1,000 troops stationed in Chad, nor Libya -- despite a history of active involvement in Chad's affairs -- took any direct action when Deby assumed control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the new leader's first actions was to free Libyan prisoners of war captured during the frequent clashes between Habre's army and Libyan forces in the 1980s. Libya sent several aircraft to ferry the freed POWs to Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one group of Libyans -- members of a specially trained unit housed in a secret camp six miles north of N'Djamena -- did not join in the repatriation. Instead, they were hastily airlifted by U.S. military planes first to Nigeria and then on the Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to authoritative sources, these evacuees -- thought to number about 700 -- were Libyan defectors belonging to the Libyan National Liberation Army (LNA). This &quot;contra&quot; force is believed to have received instruction in sabotage and guerilla infiltration from U.S. intellengence agents and to have launched attacks inside Libya from Chad territory. The LNA has served as the military wing of the anti-Qaddafi National Front for the Salvation of Libya, created in 1981, many believe by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deby denies receiving Libyan backing for his takeover, but Western officials believe he did receive arms and money from Qaddafi. Africa Confidential in London reports that Deby obtained Libyan aid in exchange for information about the CIA operation. As a former Chad armed forces commander-in-chief, Deby was in a position to have inside knowledge of what the &quot;contras&quot; were doing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deby fled Chad in early 1989, fearing that Habre was planning to accuse him of fomenting a coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the U.S. Air Force planes began the evacuation, Deby said the Libyans had been offered a choice of remaining in Chad as refugees or leaving, and U.S. officials say that everyone in the group went voluntarily. However, according to the London-based Middle East International, Red Cross officials were not allowed free access to the men before they were flown out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya responded angrily to the U.S. airlift, demanding an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council and even asking Iraq to send some of the American &quot;human shield&quot; hostages to be used to exchange for its nationals' return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why the Nigerians agreed to accept the LNA &quot;contras&quot; is unclear.  Although Nigeria and Libya have been at odds over Liberia, the two countries have reasonably good relations. General Ike Nwachukwu, the Nigeria minister of external relations, was quoted as saying the Libyans had been accepted on humanitarian grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to re-transport the group to Zaire was less surprising, given the historically close relationship between President Mobutu Sese Seko and the CIA. Zaire could be a logical base of operation if the U.S. intended to keep the force together as a fighting unit to oppose Qaddafi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to UPI, the request for transfer of the &quot;contras&quot; to Zaire was made by Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammad Ibrahim Bishari, on a visit to Kinshasa on December 13. Libya offered Mobutu oil shipments with payment deferred until 1992, the news agency said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu then announced that the U.S.-trained Libyans would be free to go home if they wished. Zaire also turned down a request for asylum from Habre, who has remained in Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until his ouster became inevitable, Habre had been asking France to come to his aid, as happened on several occasions since he seized control of N'Djamena in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But French discontent with Habre had been growing, fueled by steady reports of malfeasance and evidence of widespread human rights abuses. As Deby's MPS forces advanced towards N'Djamena, the French limited their military involvement to protection of French citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington took its cue from Paris. The American embassy in N'Djamena said that as a result of French assurances that Deby is &quot;a patriot&quot; and not a &quot;Libyan agent,&quot; the U.S. is maintaining its $ 15 million aid program in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deby has stated his intention to establish a multiparty democracy, a challenging task. After 20 years of civil war, Chad is home to many competing factions -- and to an abundance of weapons. Following several outbreaks of shooting in the capital, Deby launched a house-to-house campaign to confiscate guns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habre has also taken steps to shore up relations with Chad's powerful neighbors. He has won a pledge of friendship from Nigeria to the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deby has also mended fences to the east with Sudan, a Libyan ally where the new Chad leader enjoyed sanctuary when he fled from Habre two years ago. The office in N'Djamena of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement, which is fighting the Sudanese government, has reportedly been closed. And Sudan has offered landlocked Chad an outlet to the Red Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the greatest relaxation in tensions has been with Libya to the north. Chad and Libya are going ahead with the agreements to take their dispute over the uranium-rich Aouzou strip to the International Court of Justice at the Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many Africa observers, the chain of events surrounding Deby's coming to power suggests a possible shift in American priorities towards Africa. For the past decade, a principle tenet of U.S. policy has been opposition to what the Reagan and Bush administrations have termed &quot;Libyan expansionism&quot; on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, the staunchly pro-Western Habre has been replaced by someone with at least modest ties to Tripoli and neither Washington nor Paris seems very upset.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR>Portuguese-speaking Countries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Joao Bernardo Vieira of Guinea Bissau announced last month that the former Portuguese colony will hold its first multiparty presidential elections in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between January 20 and 25, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde, which has ruled since independence 15 years ago, will hold a national congress to debate the shift to a multiparty system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar moves are taking place in other former Portuguese colonies.  Sao Tome and Principe, a tiny west African island archipelago, scheduled multiparty presidential elections for March 3, following January 20 parliamentary voting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another archipelago, Cape Verde, held parliamentary elections last week that swept the ruling African party for the Independence of Cape Verde from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a process that has been underway since 1988, Prime Minister Pedro Pires conceded defeat after early returns gave the opposition Movement for Democracy (MPD) an estimated 65% of the vote. Presidential elections are set for February 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The primary distinction between the parties is their stance on foreign investment. Voters apparently were persuaded by the MPD's charges that the government had mishandled the economy. Cape Verde gets most of its income from foreign aid, and its biggest export is its citizens who go abroad to find employment. There are more Cape Verdeans away from the islands than the 300,000 who remain at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Change&quot; was the theme word for the campaign of MPD leader Carlos Veiga, a lawyer. That sentiment seemed to have more appeal than the government's claim to represent stability and continuity. Now Cape Verdeans face the prospect that Veiga may unseat President Aristides Pereira, a father figure for his role in overthrowing Portuguese colonialism. Pereira has won respect for his party's careful use of resources, its lack of corruption and its protection of human rights. But Veiga's message has been particularly popular among young people who don't remember the long struggle for independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main issue in presidential elections may be the MPD's proposals for development of a tourist industry, which is sees as one of the few prospects for the arid islands to support themselves. Government officials worry about whether the economic policies of equity and fairness can survive unfettered development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Mali</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the countries still clinging to one-party rule, Mali is coming under increasing public pressure. Police in the capital, Bamako, said an estimated 20,000 demonstrators marched through the streets at the end of December to demand a multiparty system. Earlier this month, Bamako was paralyzed by the first general strike since independence three decades ago. The 48-hour action drew a government promise to meet with the National Union of Malian Workers to discuss demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling Malian People's Democratic Union has strong pockets of resistence to sharing power. Nevertheless, many people expect that President Moussa Traore, who has held power since 1968, will agree to allow other parties in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many Africans are hotly debating whether the continuing movement towards pluralism will guarantee effective democracy. But there is broad agreement that the move away from authoritarian rule is an essential first step -- and a promising beginning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While war broke out in the Persian Gulf and violence flared in the Baltic Republics -- and Africa's regional conflicts either simmered or inched towards resolution -- much of the continent was taking quiet steps to satisfy the demands of pro-democracy movements. Following is a round-up of some of the developments.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Benin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of President Mathieu Kerekou, who last February was forced to fire his cabinet and replace it with a transitional government until elections could be held, has scheduled parliamentary balloting for February 17. Presidential elections will be held on March 10 and 24.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nominally Marxist Kerekou has ruled Benin since 1972 when he seized power in a military coup. He is now no more than a caretaker president with little or no power. During the transition, the country is being run by a French-trained former World Bank executive, Nicephore Soglo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, a system of multiparty democracy for the country received more than 90% approval in a public referendum. Some 64% of the voters said &quot;yes&quot; to a new constitution, and another 29% approved the document generally, but opposed a clause limiting the age of presidential candidates to between 40 and 70 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of those who voted &quot;no&quot; to the constitution said they feared it had too few safeguards against governmental abuses of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Africa watchers say Benin is a model of how autocratic rulers might relinquish power gracefully. Battered by growing opposition, the Kerekou government convened a national conference last February. While nearly 500 representatives from over 50 groups debated the country's future, Benin radio and television carried the nine-day event live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the conference blamed the government for corruption, human rights violations and bringing the country to bankruptcy, it rewarded the president and his army for their cooperation by letting Kerekou retain his office until the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't want to give anyone a lesson, but what happened here is a test,&quot; said Soglo, after being named interim prime minister. &quot;It shows you can move towards liberty without shedding blood.&quot;<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Burkina Faso</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Officials in Ouagadougou expected to finish by this week a census that began on January 5, designed to compile an electoral list of citizens over 17 years old. The actual age of voting eligibility for elections scheduled for late this year will be set by the end of the month, the government said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military leader Blaise Compaore promised to hold the multiparty vote -- the first in Burkina Faso since 1978 -- after public protests last year. A presidential ballot is set for November 3 and popular assembly delegates are to be chosen December 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since Compaore agreed to elections, 15 political parties have emerged to put forth candidates.<BR>&nbsp;<BR> Zambia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Newstead Zimba, the Secretary-General of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions, has told President Kenneth Kaunda that Zambians want to see him &quot;correcting the situation in your country first.&quot; Zimba was responding to Kaunda's peace mission to Iraq, days before the U.S. attack on Baghdad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three weeks ago, the trade union congress severed its ties with Kaunda's party and allied itself with the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), Zambia's main opposition party and one of six groups formed to contest elections scheduled for October. Zimba issued his challenge to Kaunda last week at an MMD rally attended by an estimated 50,000 supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party was made legal on January 4, after popular pressure forced Kaunda to agree to recognize competing groups. Kaunda's United National Independence Party (Unip) has ruled Zambia since independence from Britain in 1964 and has been the only legal party for 17 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, Kaunda's government has been buffeted by public discontent with the effects of the structural adjustment program mandated by the International Monetary Fund. Last June, 26 people protesting the economic austerity measures were killed by security forces. Resulting anger prompted an abortive coup, and Kaunda was seriously embarrassed by celebrations in the streets when the coup was initially reported to have succeeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The re-emergence of a multiparty system in Zambia has been troubled by accusations of unfairness from all sides. Last month Kaunda accused the MMD of planning a military coup. &quot;Multiparty elements are going around recruiting soldiers to stage a coup if they lose in the 1991 elections,&quot; the president said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders of the MMD and other parties say it is Kaunda who is trying to manipulate the system to his advantage. They point to his arrest of political opponents and the banning of rallies. In December, Kaunda warned workers at the National Broadcasting Corporation that they are part of the &quot;party machinery,&quot; and the president fired the editors of Zambia's two main papers, the Times of Zambia and the Zambia Mail. The veteran journalists, whose papers are owned by the ruling party and the government, respectively, were replaced by university lecturers known for their loyalty to the president. Kaunda also instructed government agencies to stop placing advertisements in the Catholic church-sponsored biweekly paper, the National Mirror, which has supported political pluralism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the moment, the opposition seems to have gained the momentum.  Early this month, ruling party leaders were startled by the defection to the MMD of a Unip founder and former secretary-general, Humphrey Mulemba, who said he was unhappy with the lack of &quot;democratic principles&quot; in the governing party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But any future leaders of Zambia will have to confront the country's formidable economic problems. Despite its copper reserves, Zambia is one of the continent's poorer countries and its per capita debt is one of the highest in the world. Because over 90% of the country's foreign earnings have come from copper, the decade-long slump in world commodity prices devastated Zambia's economy. Attempts to lessen its economic dependence on South Africa cost an additional $ 7 billion. So debt relief is bound to top the agenda for the winnerof this year's ballot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><BR><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;<BR> Nigeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the beginning of this month, Nigeria has been swearing in the 5,575 local council members elected in nationwide polls in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The voting process will culminate in presidential elections at the end of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The local votes were a key step in Nigeria's multi-year transition from military to civilian rule. Africa's most populous nation has had military governments for all but a decade of its 30 years of independence. And the civilian governments that presided over Nigeria from 1960-1966 and again from 1979-1983 were popularly regarded as both corrupt and ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weekly magazine Newswatch applauded the &quot;wide acceptance of the results&quot; of December's balloting as a watershed in the country's elusive quest for free and fair elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But to some observers the proceedings were marred by the low turnout -- as little as 10-15% in some places -- and by the fact that there was no secret ballot. Government officials defended the requirement that voters line up behind symbols of their candidate as necessary to prevent charges of fraud, a serious problem in past elections. Officials pledged that state and national elections would be by secret ballot, although recent government statements on the issue have been ambiguous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a further attempt to break with abuses of the past, the government banned all previous parties and decreed the establishment of two new ones -- the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC). The government also wrote manifestoes for the two groups, which are described as slightly to the left and slightly to the right of the political center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida said the two parties have the responsibility to usher in a &quot;new breed&quot; of politicians, beholden not to special interests but to their constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the local polls -- where the issues were about things like schools and roads -- ideology was in little evidence. Nor was there an apparent trend towards a winner. SDP took 232 of 453 council chairs, and won 2,934 of the 5,575 councilorships -- a slight edge in numbers. But the NRC points out that it won a slight majority of all votes cast in the country's 21 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next big challenge facing the Babangida government's transition program, according to journalist Tunde Obadina, will be the population census, scheduled for the second quarter of this year. Because the census dictates the apportionment of representation and resources, past attempts to count Nigeria's people have been plagued by tensions and even violence. The current estimate that the country has a population of 110 million is a projection from a 1963 census -- but that count, like every other in Nigeria's history -- has been fiercely disputed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUANDA -- A walk down the streets of Angola's capital is a balancing act. The once black-and-white stone mosaic pavements, signature to former Portuguese rule, have broken down into an obstacle course of loose rocks, ditches and strewn debris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost 70 percent of the national budget is funneled into the government's war effort against Unita (the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola), says Finance Minister Arguinaldo Jaime. There are few funds available for long-overdue maintenance of the city's ailing infrastructure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">War has flooded Luanda with over a million refugees, uprooted from their rural homes by the fighting. An escalation in Unita sabotage late last year has regularly disrupted electricity and water supplies to the city, prompting a health crisis which the authorities have struggled to combat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ubiquitous streams of bucket-crowned women file along the streets performing a difficult balancing feat. It is they who must locate and transport the water their families require for normal daily life. One Unicef official here estimates that each of them spends an average of three hours daily on this task alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most shops in the city are empty and locked. In the official lojas do povo (people's stores), where entry is restricted to ration card-holding Angolans who are formally employed, only sacks of dry beans and a few cans of dried milk powder sit on the mostly empty metal shelves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, flourishing commerce can be found on the outskirts of the congested city. Roque Santeiro, named for the title character of a popular Brazilian television soap opera, is a prime example of the &quot;parallel&quot; market system that the government has come to accept as a fact of life in Angola's stagnant economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here at Roque you can get anything,&quot; boasts one marketer as she encourages passers-by to try her home-made cigarettes. Walking along the long rows of stalls, over layers of crushed imported beer cans and through partitions of dangling blue jeans, shoppers can find goods from all across the globe: cashews from Germany, chickens from Argentina and enough imported alcohol to flood the Bay of Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets are also the only place to find such otherwise unobtainable items as marriage licenses, airplane tickets, and even newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But of course all these goods have a price -- a very high price in comparison to official stores. A gallon jug of wine which sells for 200 kwanza ($ 6.50 at the official exchange rate) at the lojas do povo will bring about 8,000 kwanza ($ 266) at Roque. Although the unofficial value of the dollar is much higher than the official rate, a planned devaluation, part of the government's economic reform program, has yet to be implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only people with access to foreign currency have enough cash to make purchases at the markets. Most Angolans must resort to barter to afford what they need at Roque. Beer has become the unofficial medium of trade. One bottle or can buys a tank full of gasoline. Two crates can purchase a round-trip plane ticket to Rio de Janeiro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once again, it is mostly women who are in evidence, transporting up to three beer crates on their heads as they walk into the market to shop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1003 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After nearly three decades of almost continual conflict, hopes for peace in Mozambique and Angola have risen. Major hurdles stand in the way of final accords, but negotiation efforts have produced signs of movement towards a cease-fire in both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within a few weeks, Portuguese intermediaries hope to convene the sixth round of talks between the government of Angola and the Unita rebel movement headed by Jonas Savimbi. The session will be scheduled when both parties have agreed to terms of a settlement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, in an attempt to break the logjam in the negotiations, U.S., Soviet and Portuguese officials met in Washington with representatives of both Angolan parties to draw up a draft accord. The meeting, at the State Department on December 13, followed an unprecedented tete-a-tete between Savimbi and then-Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevarnadze and a separate discussion between U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro van-Dunem Loy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the Washington meetings, Savimbi announced that Unita's leadership -- which had gathered in Washington -- had accepted the entire draft. The government negotiators returned to Angola to report to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord calls for legalization of political activity within a multiparty system in Angola, international monitoring of the cease-fire, an end to all outside arms shipments, free and fair elections monitored by outside observers and an understanding on a firm date for a nation-al election prior to a cessation in hostilities. These points bridge many of the differences which have divided the two sides in months of previous discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government in Luanda has not issued a formal declaration on the Washington accord. And, with distrust remaining high, Unita and the government have been trading accusations, each blaming the other for delay. Following a high-level meeting at Unita headquarters in southeastern Angola, a Unita communique on January 8 reiterated support for the Washington accord and charged the other side with blocking a settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Luanda saw in the Unita communique what it regarded as new preconditions for peace. The document said the ruling MPLA should &quot;present its proposed law on political parties at the next round of negotiations&quot; and also asked that the U.S. and the Soviets become direct participants rather than observers in the negotiations. The government rejected both of these steps as infringements on its sovereignty and promised to respond &quot;forcefully&quot; to Unita maneuvers &quot;designed to gain time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the intermediaries have been seeking to find a compromise on the election timetable issue, which appears to be the main obstacle to a cease-fire agreement. The government favors a three-year process while Unita wants a vote within 12 months. The formation of a new national army may also still be a sticking point, although compromise language is contained in the Washington accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S., Soviet and Portuguese officials have been meeting to forge other language, which they hope will be accepted by both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the political negotiations, emergency relief operations have suffered from ups and downs which have left most of Angola's neediest people without adequate assistance. A United Nations food program launched late last year with U.S. backing has encountered numerous roadblocks, despite an agreement by both the government and Unita to allow shipments through contested areas. About 110,000 tons of food aid are required to meet the needs of 1.8 million civilians, the UN says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mozambique, a new round of talks between government and the Renamo rebels are expected this month, following last month's agreement on a partial cease-fire. Under the December pact, 7,000 Zimbabwean soldiers, who had been fighting alongside Mozambique government forces, have withdrawn to the Beira and Limpopo corridors -- the narrow strips of land along which run the railways and highways linking land-locked Zimbabwe with the Mozambican ports of Beira and Maputo. The Zimbabwean troops are allowed to guard the corridors, but their movements are restricted to within three kilometers (1.8 miles) of the edge of the strips, and the Zimbab-weans are barred from offensive actions against Renamo units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 10, an international commission established to oversee the partial cease-fire said Renamo rebels had apparently broken the pact. Heavy fighting reportedly took place near the Beira corridor when Renamo forces sought to take over positions evacuated last month by the Zimbabwean troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The membership of the 40-member monitoring commission includes the governments of Mozambique and Zimbabwe, Renamo and nine other nations chosen by the two sides -- four permanent UN Security Council members (the U.S., USSR, Britain and France), plus Congo, Italy, Kenya, Portugal and Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the partial cease-fire accord, talks between the government and Renamo resumed in Rome last month without any reported progress. Currently, the Italian government is seeking to identify and narrow the differences that prevent a full cease-fire accord. Already, the government has taken most of the steps Renamo has been demanding. A new pluralist constitution was adopted in November, and the parliament last month approved legislation creating a multiparty electoral system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the fighting continues, putting more and more Mozambicans at risk of serious privation. The two million people uprooted by war within the country are in most immediate danger, a report compiled by UN and government experts says. &quot;Massive, direct, emergency assistance is needed now,&quot; according to the report, which was completed last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than a million tons of food aid will be required this year, including 354,000 tons for free distribution to the totally destitute. The remaining 687,000 tons would be placed on sale in towns and rural areas, the report says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">566 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAIRO-- &quot;Everybody is living in fear,&quot; says Bishop Taban Paride, whose diocese in southern Sudan includes a large area of territory held by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), which is fighting the Sudanese government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least once or twice a month, with no warning, bombs from high-flying government aircraft drop on villages and towns. &quot;They just bomb any corrugated sheet building or anything at all -- they don't know,&quot; he says.  People have become so scared that &quot;everyone runs when any plane passes over,&quot; the Roman Catholic cleric says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, church and community leaders have been urging people who don't have to live or work in town, especially children and women, to move far enough away to avoid the deadly explosives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Taban was interviewed when he attended the African-American Conference here, organized by the African-American Institute in New York and co-hosted by the Egyptian government. The Sudanese bishop appealed for world attention to Sudan's plight and for international action to force a settlement of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe the kind of pressures and sanctions which were put on South Africa should also be put on the Sudan government,&quot; Taban said. &quot;We need pressure from outside because the government will not listen to the voice of the suffering people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five to six million Sudanese are considered at risk of starving this year, according to international aid experts, and widespread deaths of children are already being reported. The UN says 1.3 million tons of food aid will be needed to offset the shortages caused by failing harvests in several parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, political problems have kept much of the food already donated from being distributed to those in need. The government of General Omar Hassan al-Bashir has blocked relief operations mounted by the UN and other agencies, fearing the supplies would help the rebel effort and that relief convoys would provide cover for the transport of military materiel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On January 16, the United Nations postponed a visit to Khartoum by Under Secretary General James Jonah, who was to have discussed rellief operations with the government. The U.S. and other aid donors have been asking for assurances that supplies wil be distributed to those in need. But the al-Bashir government's ties with Iraq and its record of human rights abuses have complicated relations with Washington and other Western capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bishop Taban, the government's air war is being fought by Libyans. &quot;We know because we have the wreckage of a Libyan plane lying outside the town, and the Libyan pilot was captured by the SPLA,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sporadic bombing of Taban's own town of Torit, which was captured by the SPLA in 1989, has disrupted almost all forms of normal daily life, he says. &quot;We had established schools and several cooperatives with the women,&quot; says the bishop, &quot;and rural projects as well. But this has all been interrupted by the bombing.&quot; At night, he says, there is free movement of people and even relief trucks in the area, but by day the overflying planes &quot;harass and terrorize the people.&quot; The bombardment has made it impossible for people to cultivate, weed, or harvest their crops -- even in areas where rain has been sufficient for a good harvest. As a result, the food crisis is worsening, he says. &quot;We are facing a disaster.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Famine is stalking several African countries where continuous wars have disrupted harvests and relief efforts and created hundreds of thousands of refugees. &quot;About 20 million people in Africa will face starvation this winter unless food aid is provided immediately,&quot; six non-governmental international relief agencies said in a joint appeal earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aid is going to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, while Africa is being neglected, the agencies said. &quot;Africa has slipped off the priority list because it is a creeping and continuous crisis with no easy solutions,&quot; Brian Neldner of Lutheran World Service told Reuters. &quot;Our priorities must still be in Africa,&quot; said Paer Stenbaeck, secretary-general of the Red Cross League, who is chairing the steering committee set up by the six agencies. In addition to the Lutheran Federation and the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the groups include Caritas, Catholic Relief Services, Oxfam and the World Council of Churches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) says 15 African countries confront &quot;exceptional food emergencies&quot; this year. The FAO has asked UN member states for an urgent response to the shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five most critically affected countries, according to the relief agencies, are all consumed by serious, long-lasting war. &quot;Of most concern is the rapidly deteriorating situation in Sudan and the continuing food emergency in northern Ethiopia,&quot; the FAO says. Between two and three million people are threatened with starving or dying from thirst as fighting continues in Ethiopia (see Africa News, November 12, 1990). More than twice that many are considered at risk in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half of Mozambique's 16 million people face famine -- two million are threatened with immediate starvation -- as a result of the continuing war between the government and the Renamo rebel movement, according to a recent analysis by the UN and the Mozambican government. And nearly two million Angolans are at risk of starving due to conflict and drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Liberia, year-long strife has forced some 800,000 people out of the country and left at least a million more homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries threatened by famine stemming from drought and other causes include Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Tanzania. Zimbabwe, although it produces a food surplus, is dangerously short of vehicles to transport food to drought-stricken areas in five of the country's eight provinces.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the January 16th attack on Iraq, the U.S. State Department issued warnings about possible dangers to Americans in African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing security concerns stemming from the Gulf crisis, diplomatic missions in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco were encouraged to evacuate all &quot;non-essential personnel and dependents.&quot; Public opinion in the three countries was judged overwhelmingly sympathetic to Iraq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Mauritania and Sudan, the department took the unusual step of making the departures obligatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nigeria, a dozen consular staff were evacuated from the northern town of Kaduna, where demonstrators converged on the U.S. mission last September after American troops were dispatched to Saudi Arabia. The State Department also warned U.S. citizens against travel to northern Nigeria, and urged Americans throughout the country to stock several days supply of food and water and to stay off the streets if tensions run high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's inspector-general of police, Alhaji Aliyu Atta, promised earlier this month that his forces will provide special protection against attack for all expatriates, including Americans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerns about safety persisted, however, especially in the north, where the largely Muslim population is strongly pro-Iraq. Those sympathies proved embarrassing to British officials last September, when the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) conducted its annual audience polls for &quot;Man of the Year 1990.&quot; Listeners to the BBC's Hausa service, broadcasting to northern Nigeria, overwhelmingly chose Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts suggest that the sentiment is not so much pro-Iraqi as it is anti-American, fanned by the Gulf operation. Across the continent magazines and newspapers in many countries have printed letters from critics of U.S. policy and in some places there have been street demonstrations, apparently fueled by a belief that the U.S. is employing a double standard.  Three issues that have prompted particularly bitter comments are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* American political and military support for Morocco when it invaded neighboring Western Sahara in 1975, using historical arguments similar to those Saddam Hussein used to justify his claims to Kuwait;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Bush administration's refusal to intervene to stop the carnage in Liberia's civil war, despite pleas from a broad range of Liberians who argued that it was American aid that had kept the unpopular Doe regime in power after it lost the election of 1985 -- and despite the presence of four U.S.  warships and 2,000 marines off the Liberian coast; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* U.S. resistance to comprehensive sanctions against the South African government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, though, the dominant sentiment across Africa seems to be the fear that the Gulf war will further divert attention and resources from African crises. The January 14-20 issue of West Africa magazine notes the recent appeal by an international coalition of aid groups on behalf of the 20 million Africans now facing starvation. &quot;We can now shift all attention to one figure -- the 500 million pounds which has been spent by the British government so far in the Gulf,&quot; the magazine says. &quot;That amount could feed all those affected by the famine for five months. Add what the U.S. has spent so far, and is willing to spend, and the dimensions of the irony come into view.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The economic costs of the Persian Gulf crisis have been especially high in the non-oil-producing countries of Africa, where escalating petroleum prices have scuttled development plans and threatened lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that every one dollar rise in the price of a barrel of oil adds an extra $ 100 million to the annual fuel bill of the least developed African nations. By October last year, the average price of a barrel of oil had risen to $ 35, up from an average of $17 inthe first half of the year. Projections for 1991 see even higher averages as a possibility.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of 1990, the added costs of African oil imports had reached an estimated $ 2.7 billion, putting new strains on energy and transportation systems that are already fragile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when African economies desperately need to be expanding, says Adebayo Adedeji, head of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the lack of affordable fuel has restricted economic recovery. In non-oil-exporting countries, output growth rate has actually declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Across the continent, fuel costs to consumers have more than doubled.  Ghana's Finance Minister, Kwesi Botchwey, told the Ghana News Agency that higher oil prices cost Ghana an additional $ 50-60 million in 1990, despite an aggressive energy conservation policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern and southern Africa have been affected most severely. Except for Angola, which exports 80-90% of its oil to the United States, there are no significant oil resources in the region, although Zambia and Zimbabwe both have coal reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Namibia, the government's Equalization Fund -- used to stabilize imported fuel prices and ease disruptive fluctuations -- has been totally depleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petroleum prices in Zambia have increased 400% since August, and shortages have led to long lines at fuel pumps, as has happened also in Uganda and Mozambique. Unofficial estimates put Zambia's current rate of inflation at 100%. In presenting the 1991 budget to parliament, Finance Minister Gibson Chigaga conceded that Zambia didn't meet most of its 1990 budget targets and has little chance of dealing with its $ 1.3 billion debt payment arrears to the World Bank and the IMF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most worrisome to international analysts is Mozambique, where a war waged by Renamo guerrillas against the government has aimed at the infrastructure of rural life. An estimated two million people who have been unable to plant or harvest crops would starve without continued emergency food distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because guerrilla attacks have destroyed much of the country's roads and rail lines and made remaining links unsafe, plentiful fuel supplies are necessary to supply rural areas with food by air. Peter Simkin, the top United Nations official in Mozambique, told the Reuter news agency that oil price hikes have raised the cost of transporting a ton of corn from $ 580 to over $ 1000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the disruptive effect of higher prices, some of the region's development plans have been based on long-term contracts to purchase oil at concessional rates from Kuwait and Iraq -- supplies which are no longer available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the ECA estimates that Africa's oil exporters may earn an extra $ 10.5 billion from higher prices, it warns against seeing &quot;these temporary gains as signifying an end to the extremely difficult economic circumstances prevailing in many of the African oil-exporting countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, reluctant to count on any oil price windfall, has based its 1991 budget on an average world price of $ 21 a barrel. At the same time, it haspledged to help its African neighbors, partly by providing discounted fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another attempt to ease the burden of higher prices, the U.S. in September organized 25 industrial countries into a group to aid nations severely affected by the price hikes. But most of the $ 13 million fund established by the group was earmarked for Middle East nations to encourage their compliance with sanctions against Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been other economic effects of the Gulf crisis as well. Across north Africa, governments obtain foreign exchange from citizens who work in the Gulf and send their wages home. Egypt, for example, depends on such remittances to purchase 40% of its imports. Although Egypt has suffered more directly than other African countries from declining traffic in the Suez Canal and a sharp drop-off in tourism, trade and tourism are down throughout the region. In addition, there is the cost of resettling the returning migrant workers. For Egypt, the bill for absorbing some 600,000 workers is expected to top $ 4.7 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bettino Craxi, a former Italian Prime Minister who is now the special representative on debt for UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, has proposed an international moratorium on debt collection for the countries hit hardest by the crisis. Without substantial alleviation of its effects, Craxi said, the Gulf conflict &quot;is likely to produce increased poverty and environmental degradation.&quot; Besides the negative growth rates the crisis will produce in Africa, Craxi predicted, African countries will have to further deplete their forest reserves to compensate for the loss of petroleum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Africa's structural weakness makes substituting alternative energy supplies more difficult than in industrial countries, a conservation mood has gripped the continent. &quot;We must courageously tighten our belts with a high sense of responsibility,&quot; Prime Minister Obed Dlamini of Swaziland told a November meeting of 18 east and southern African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana has demonstrated already that conservation measures can yield quick results. Using guidelines established by the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the National Energy Board, Ghanaian industries have seen substantial savings. In its own buildings, the ministry used 50%t less energy between July and November last year than during the same period the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If there is a silver lining for Africa, it may be that the resources of the continent will attract increased world attention to its problems.  Millard Arnold, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued last month in a column for the Christian Science Monitor that the United States has ignored Africa's potential economic importance to the industrialized world. Arnold points out that the U.S. has been importing more oil from Angola and Nigeria than from Iraq and Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, America's fourth leading supplier, sells the U.S. nearly 900,000 barrels a day, compared with 698,000 from Iraq. Angola has averaged 264,000 barrels a day, more than twice the 106,000 that came from Kuwait before the invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arnold pleads for more U.S. support for Africa's struggling pro-democracy movements and for African countries' attempts to achieve economic stability. &quot;Given the enormous stakes, policymakers need to consider most carefully our cavalier approach to Africa,&quot; Arnold wrote. &quot;If things heat up in Africa, it may get very cold in New England.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling Africa's economic and political problems &quot;an inherent threat to world peace and stability,&quot; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says &quot;it is high time&quot; that the international community seek solutions and provide adequate assistance. A &quot;collective&quot; effort must be devised to &quot;spare Africa&quot; from being left out of the changing world order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubarak's remarks were made in a formal opening statement to the 21st African-American Conference, organized by the New York-based African-American Institute and co-hosted by the Egyptian government. The speech was delivered by Boutros Boutros Ghali, minister of state for foreign affairs, who served as co-chair of the meeting along with Rep. William Gray (D-PA), majority whip of the U.S. House of Representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day gathering of about 100 Americans and Africans was attended by cabinet ministers from a dozen African countries, members of the U.S. Congress and their aides, and business leaders, journalists and political figures from both continents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a 70-minute meeting with heads of delegations and other conference delegates at the presidential palace, Mubarak reiterated Egypt's concern about Africa's future and the negative impact the Gulf crisis is having on various countries across the continent. Mubarak, who chaired the 54-member Organization of African Unity in 1989, said Egypt was committed to its historical position as a &quot;bridge&quot; between Africa and the Arab world. The connection could be mutually helpful, he said, with Africa benefiting from Arab investments and Arab businesses profiting from expanded markets.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak faced little public opposition to his decision to join the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq. But the Persian Gulf conflict has many thoughtful Egyptians -- among them senior Mubarak advisors -- concerned about the implications for the country's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statements and interviews, Mubarak conveys certitude</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about his policy. &quot;I am not a defender of the emir &cent;of Kuwait/,&quot; Mubarak said in a 70-minute session with delegates attending the 21st African-American Conference here. &quot;But we could never accept this aggression against another Arab state.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After sending &quot;more than 20 private messages&quot; to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein offering a face-saving way out of the crisis, Mubarak said he became convinced that force might be the only means of &quot;restoring legitimacy&quot; to Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at the same time, Mubarak has also signaled reservations about committing Egypt to actions which would shift the current balance of forces in the region irrevocably. &quot;Mubarak really believes Saddam Hussein must be Tde-fanged',&quot; one senior diplomat familiar with the president's thinking said.  &quot;But Egypt's strategists do not want to see Iraq destroyed and left vulnerable to picking apart by vultures from all directions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a commentary on the crisis earlier this month, Ibrahim Nafei, editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram, Cairo's largest newspaper, said Egyptian leaders had &quot;serious apprehensions about Israeli intervention in the Gulf crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This ambiguity, as reflected in some of Mubarak's own statements, has caused confusion and consternation in Washington. &quot;We will oppose Israeli involvement in a war, and we would refuse to take part with Israel,&quot; Mubarak was reported as saying on January 9 at the opening of Cairo's annual book fair. &quot;We do not agree to any Israeli intervention under any circumstances,&quot; he said, according to the newspaper Al-Akhbar. A few days later, he was quoted saying that Egypt would not join in an attack on Baghdad but would only participate in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While joining President Bush in rejecting linkage between the Kuwait invasion and the Palestinian issue, Mubarak also emphasized continued backing for the Palestinian cause. &quot;We have to move on the Palestinian problem,&quot; he said in his meeting with African-American Conference delegates. But Iraq's actions &quot;can in no way contribute&quot; to a solution of the issue, Mubarak said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubarak says his government's domestic policies &quot;are putting Egypt on the right economic track,&quot; and that its commitment to &quot;democracy and free expression&quot; should insure stability and growth in the years to come. However, growing discontent at home could be one outcome of the Gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In parliamentary elections late last year, the victory by Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party was diminished by a low voter turnout and a boycott by most of the opposition parties. Islamic fundamentalists have attacked the president for his avowedly pro-Western tilt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubarak's decision to join Washington in confronting Iraq &quot;is the biggest gamble of his reign,&quot; says Ahmed Abdalla, an Egyptian political scientist. The liberal right opposition and the Islamic movement have both exhibited rifts within their own ranks on the issue. &quot;If the Gulf crisis takes a longer course, these splits augur for a reconfiguration of political forces in Egypt,&quot; Abdalla says in the current issue of the Washington-based Middle East Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Khalafalla, a leading Islamic theologian, has charged that Mubarak's decision to join the United States in confronting Iraq &quot;not only violates Islamic values but also goes against Arab culture and history.&quot; The war with Iraq &quot;will destroy the Arab nation&quot; and seriously damage Egypt, he argued in a column published in early January in Al-Ahram.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Misgivings about war have also been expressed by the Coptic Christian leadership. In a sermon during midnight Mass on January 6 -- Christmas Eve on the Orthodox calendar -- Pope Shenouda III issued a strong appeal for peaceful resolution of the crisis. With a membership that may be as large as five million -- or a tenth of Egypt's population -- the Coptic Church includes not only some of the nation's professional elite but also a significant portion of the poorest strata of society. When tensions erupt, these impoverished Copts are often the targets of discrimination and even violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the current confrontation creates further economic strains for Egypt, the resulting tensions may cause new difficulties not only for Copts but also for Mubarak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egyptian officials estimate that the Gulf crisis has already cost the country nearly $ 4.5 billion. Over $1 billion has been lost in remittances from Egyptian workers in Gulf states, notably those in Kuwait and Iraq, where an estimated 1.3 million Egyptians lived and worked prior to Iraq's invasion.  &quot;Additional food will be needed to feed returning workers and their families,&quot; according to a recent analysis issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The returnees' need for housing, education and jobs will further stretch the demands already being made by Egypt's rapidly growing population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has also suffered from a 20 percent reduction in Suez Canal traffic and a major drop-off in tourism. Even before the January 16 attack on Iraq, Egyptian businesses reported cancellation rates of 60 to 80 percent from Europe and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Europeans think we are close to the war zone,&quot; says Seoud Zarkani, whose family operates a tour business and Egypt's only private airline. &quot;They don't realize we are hundreds of miles from Kuwait and out of range of Iraq's missiles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These losses have been offset, however, by significant dividends resulting directly from the crisis. Egypt's oil revenues have risen by about $ 1.5 billion, although the country's limited oil output generates only a small portion of total foreign exchange requirements. A big chunk of Egypt's $ 50 billion-plus foreign debt has been written off -- the U.S. has cancelled $ 7 billion incurred for military purchases, and Saudi Arabia and three other oil-rich Gulf states have agreed to forgive another $ 7 billion in loans Egypt owed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, last month Saudi Arabia announced a $ 1.5 billion grant to Egypt to help meet expenses arising from the Gulf crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt's ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a multi-million dollar stabilization program have accelerated, thanks to the debt reduction and the increased aid which have resulted from Egypt's participation in the anti-Iraq coalition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this has led some Egyptians to see the current confrontation principally in economic terms. &quot;The Egyptian government, like the Americans, wants to send its troops to Saudi Arabia to get a lot of money,&quot; said Mustaffa Cherif, an accounting clerk from Aswan, during a street corner conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many others here seemed concerned about the effect war could have on the economic steps that the country has taken in recent years. &quot;The Egyptian people are looking for peace,&quot; said Rahman Kattap, a shopkeeper who recently earned his license to practice law. &quot;I want to appeal to Saddam Hussein on behalf of all Arabic people -- you are a Muslim and a brother -- to return back to your home. We are not afraid of you but we are afraid of what you are going to do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mubarak, too, said he sought to convince Saddam Hussein to turn back.  &quot;I personally tried to tell him that this action he has taken will never be accepted,&quot; the Egyptian leader said in his session with the African-American Conference delegates. The president appeared stung both by Saddam's rejection of Egyptian attempts to mediate the crisis and by a feeling that Saddam had lied about his intentions towards Kuwait. Although Saddam is &quot;not a lunatic,&quot; Mubarak said, &quot;he is living in another world.&quot; The Iraqi leader's belief that he can win a war would make sense &quot;if he was fighting Yemen or Djibouti,&quot; but not when he is facing &quot;the most powerful nation on earth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Egypt has sent about 30,000 troops to Saudi Arabia, including two crack divisions -- the 4th Armoured and 3rd Mechanized Infantry -- along with Special Forces and chemical warfare units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about long-term security arrangements in the Gulf, Mubarak said he does not believe American troops should remain after resolution of the current crisis. But there should be &quot;a security plan&quot; with American support in readiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of a demolished Iraq is as worrisome to Egypt's strategists is the idea of Saddam left strong enough to resume his aggression. &quot;Egypt wants to be appreciated as the leader and savior of the Arab world,&quot; political scientist Abdalla says, &quot;but the prospect that the destruction of Iraq is the price for this to happen would give Egypt's triumph a bitter taste and the regime risks opprobrium as an American accomplice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Mubarak's advisors want to avoid is creation of a regional power vacuum, following an eradication of Iraq's military might, which would be filled by Iran and Israel -- two traditional Egyptian adversaries. &quot;Mubarak was the chief proponent of the pro-Iraq tilt the U.S. adopted in the Iran-Iraq war,&quot; notes one top-level Western diplomat wryly. &quot;His reasons for that stance have not been altered by the current crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many observers believe that the balance of forces as it has existed in recent years has been disrupted unalterably. Beginning with the end of the Cold War and continuing into the current shooting war, the &quot;prevailing structure&quot; among Arab states &quot;has collapsed and cannot be restored,&quot; argues Mohammed Sid-Ahmed, an Egyptian political commentator. &quot;The Arab league is no longer operative,&quot; he writes in Middle East Report. &quot;Non-Arab states such as Iran, Turkey and Israel are bound to acquire an enhanced role in the regional competition for supremacy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge facing Egypt, he says, is to emerge as &quot;a model in the Arab world of deepened institutionalization and democratization.&quot; The alternative, Sid-Ahmed and others believe, is division and militarization which will seriously drain the resources of Egypt and its neighbors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 39-year-old star of Cameroon's World Cup soccer team, Roger Milla, has come out of retirement for the second time. Last week Milla played a token 30 minutes with the Indomitable Lions of Cameroon in an exhibition match against England at Wembley Stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before the match, Milla announced it would be his last appearance in international competition. Since the World Cup last year in Italy, Milla has made numerous appearances on behalf of his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Called out of retirement by presidential decree to play with the World Cup team, Milla scored four goals to lead the Lions to the quarterfinals.  Although they lost that match to England 3-2 in extra time, the Cameroon club was the first African team ever to reach the quarterfinals, and the victory was celebrated throughout the continent. Milla has been voted 1990 African Footballer of the Year by journalists from 49 African countries, and the New York-based Village Voice named him their 1990 Male Sports Personality of the Year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soccer fans around the world hailed the inventive and offensive play of Milla and his teammates -- reminiscent of high-scoring Brazilian teams of the 1970s -- in an otherwise dreary series of World Cup games. In recognition of Cameroon's performance, Fifa, the international soccer governing body, has granted Africa an additional slot in the 1994 World Cup games, for a total of three berths.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The world has become familiar with Scuds and Patriot missiles, but one of the most highly-prized weapons in the Gulf war is a little-known, long-range artillery gun made by South Africa -- and sold to both sides in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The G-5 howitzer, produced by the South African government-owned arms manufacturing company known as Armscor, &quot;poses a greater threat to allied troops&quot; in the war region than Iraqi Scuds, London's Independent newspaper reported late last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military experts say Iraq has at least 100 G-5s, and some estimates run as high as 200. But the South African government denies the Independent's claim that Armscor was still supplying 155 mm ammunition for the guns until late last year. That would have violated the UN arms embargo against Iraq.  Saudi Arabia and Israel also made recent purchases, the London-based newsletter Southscan reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armscor obtained the know-how for the G-5 through one of the largest breaches in the long-standing UN arms embargo against South Africa. Between 1976 and 1978, Space Research Corporation, an American and Canadian-owned firm, sold approximately 60,000 155 mm extended-range artillery shells and related technology to Armscor, along with at least four 155 mm guns, including three advanced prototypes. According to a congressional study of the transactions, the sales provided South Africa with the capacity to develop and manufacture the G-5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A referendum to decide the future of the disputed territory of Western Sahara is moving up on the United Nations agenda, despite complications created by the Persian Gulf war. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar is completing a report on how the world organization could implement the terms of a Security Council resolution that calls for a vote by the territory's inhabitants to choose between independence or incorporation into Morocco. A UN technical team visited the area last year to gather the information de Cuellar needs to recommend the civilian, military and security arrangements required to carry out the Council mandate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for the referendum were slated for completion last fall, but Iraq's invasion of Kuwait diverted UN attention and delayed work on the report. Said Yiba, a representative at the UN for the Saharan independence movement Polisario, says his group hopes the precedent of a firm UN response to Iraq's action will insure that Western Sahara is not overlooked. &quot;Morocco invaded our country in 1975, and we are eager for the UN to enforce its resolution and give the Saharan people a chance to decide the future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to UN sources, Morocco has been reluctant to provide all the information de Cuellar's staff has requested about the size of its military presence in Western Sahara. One unknown factor in the situation is whether political fallout from the Gulf war will affect Moroccan King Hassan II's commitment to cooperate with the UN-supervised poll. The monarch committed a token force of 1,200 soldiers to the anti-Iraq coalition, but popular sentiment in his country appears solidly behind Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The king has refused to allow public criticism of his decision, but the government last week permitted a large pro-Iraqi demonstration to take place in Rabat, sponsored by opposition political parties and major trade unions.</SPAN></P>

The most recent withdrawal is from Tanzania, where 22 non-essential staff and 59 dependents at the U.S. embassy have also been sent home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department says the move was taken because of &quot;a credible threat of pro-Iraqi terrorist action directed at U.S. government facilities and personnel in Tanzania.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early January, Peace Corps activities were suspended in three north African countries -- Morocco, Tunisia and Mauritania. Most of the volunteers who left those countries have had to end their terms of service, a Peace Corps spokeswoman said last week. New assignments for some have been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 2,500 volunteers in 30 other African countries have been unaffected by the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war also cut short a tour of Africa by two high-ranking American officials. Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Louis Sullivan and Dr.  Ronald Roskens, administrator of the Agency for International Development (AID), were recalled to Washington last month before making scheduled stops in Mali and Senegal. Before returning home, they visited Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, South Africa and Zimbabwe to examine health problems affecting African children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra -- If the term &quot;symphony orchestra&quot; calls to mind violins and cellos and oboes, a group of African musicians wants you to think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pan African Orchestra, based in Ghana, may be a novel venture, but its members aim to be taken seriously as artists. Musical director Nana Danso Abiam, who also serves as conductor, says the original intent of the group's founders was &quot;to bring the diverse resources of the rich African musical heritage together.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in 1988 and still struggling for survival, the 22-piece orchestra has been buoyed in recent months by critical acclaim for its performances in Ghana and by the opportunity for a European tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestra's guiding principle is to perform indigenous African music using only instruments indigenous to the continent. That doesn't mean, says director Nana Danso, that either the music or the way it is presented will be familiar to African audiences. &quot;It is not purely traditional,&quot; he says, &quot;because the orchestra fuses different instruments. It is, therefore, neo-traditional.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nana Danso hopes that the fusion of elements will stimulate experimentation with new forms of musical expression and encourage compositions designed for the unique blending of instruments in the orchestra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As its name implies, the Pan African Orchestra isn't limiting its scope to Ghana or to west Africa. The ultimate objective is the formation of a 108-piece symphonic orchestra incorporating instruments from across the continent. Among the instruments expected to become a part of the mix are husk-cane and bamboo flutes, hand or finger pianos, wooden xylophones, harp lutes like the Senegalese kora, and drums of assorted sizes and sounds as well as other percussion instruments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nana Danso, who says musicians from many parts of Africa are being invited to participate, envisions a mixed repertoire that will include traditional music from different African communities as well as merging blends of many traditions. To insure high standards and the preservation of techniques and expertise that might die out otherwise, the orchestra plans to develop a training program for music teachers. The group's founders hope, eventually, to mass-produce African instruments according to strict quality control standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestra's 22 current members consist of twelve players of the atenteben, a bamboo flute; two players of the gonje, a one-stringed violin; three xylophone, or gyile, players; three drummers and the conductor. Although the musicians are from diverse backgrounds, few have more than a secondary school education. But since playing in the orchestra, all the members have learned to read music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its ambitious schemes, the orchestra has yet to resolve its toughest problem -- finances. Already, the orchestra has collapsed twice for lack of funds. And constant money shortages have led to a turnover of members and made creating a cohesive musical unit difficult. But the current members say they are determined to forge ahead with their plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nana Danso, the group needs $ 700 a month to continue functioning at its present level. While the amount is miniscule by the standards of most orchestras, it is a high sum for musicians in Ghana. And much more will be needed to implement any of the group's long-range plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The orchestra's concert in Accra last September was the first performance in 15 months. But the standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience, which included large numbers of foreigners as well as Ghanaians, renewed the members' confidence that their efforts can find wide acceptance, both in Africa and abroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who was named interim president of Somalia late last month by the rebel movement which ousted former President Mohamed Siad Barre, has called for a national conference of all the country's political groupings on February 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mahdi Mohamed issued his call during a BBC interview last week after several opposition figures denounced his selection by the United Somali Congress (USC). The group took control of the capital, Mogadishu, following Siad's flight from the city on January 26.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deposed leader, who had ruled the country since 1969 when he took power in a military coup, left behind a devastated scene. During the month before Siad left, his troops shelled the capital with artillery fire and rocket-launchers. As he fled, &quot;his troops looted the central bank,&quot; UPI's Neil Fleming reported from Mogadishu. &quot;They turned foreign embassies into matchsticks after the diplomats left. They even pillaged the blood bank, throwing away the blood to steal the refrigerators.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Left behind were the bodies of slain soldiers and civilians, streets covered with rubble, and power and telephone lines downed across roads and buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for the incoming administration, reconstructing the country may be secondary to the challenge of forging enough of a political consensus to govern. The new president said the purpose of the February 28 conference is &quot;to decide collectively the political future of Somalia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Somali politics are extremely factionalized, reflecting the country's long history of inter-clan rivalry. Each of the main opposition groups is rooted in a different clan, and most suffer from internal fractures along sub-clan lines. The USC itself has at least three identifiable factions, one of which opposed the choice of Mahdi Mohamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His selection is also condemned by the Somali National Movement (SNM), which won control over much of the north of the country from Siad's troops prior to the USC's assault on Mogadishu. &quot;If necessary we will fight against him,&quot; SNM London representative Ali Hassan Hussein said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USC says representatives of all opposition movements inside Somalia took part in and approved the new interim president and the 10-member cabinet which was named on February 2. The new president said the government would serve only long enough to ensure free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think that even if some members of the new interim government get a taste for power they would try to hold onto it,&quot; Rakiya Omaar, director of the London-based human rights group Africa Watch, told Reuters. &quot;Somali people are too hungry for choice.&quot; Somalis now need &quot;goodwill and a lot of support&quot; to rebuild their country, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a swearing-in ceremony for the new cabinet, Mahdi Mohamed appealed for immediate international emergency assistance and for longer-term development aid to recover from the destruction. He said the country needs food, fuel, medicines and medical equipment, as well as personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continuing disorder in the capital -- where armed bands have been looting and terrorizing residents -- and the lack of communication links to the outside world have prevented the arrival of emergency assessment teams from donor countries and agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, recent fighting and the change in government have produced a new wave of refugees. The largest outflow is believed to have occurred in the north, where between 12,000 and 50,000 persons are thought to have crossed into Ethiopia. Several thousand other Somalis have fled to Djibouti and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside Somalia itself, pockets of displaced people have been created by the conflict. &quot;People are not yet returning to Mogadishu, since the situation there remains chaotic,&quot; said Haram Ruiz of the Washington-based U.S.  Committee for Refugees. &quot;What we are hearing is that there are great problems in the areas to which people who fled Mogadishu concentrated, particularly in Kismayo where there is no food.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will be no election this year, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced last week. &quot;Nobody should go around cheating the people &cent;into thinking/ that elections are on,&quot; Moi told guests at the opening of an agricultural show in western Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next election in the country is scheduled for 1993, and the president said he does not intend to move the voting up. Moi has been under pressure from domestic opponents, as well as from overseas critics, to allow greater democratic participation and restore constitutional safeguards that have been eroded in recent years. The Kenyan leader has repeatedly rejected calls for a return to the multiparty rule that was formally abolished in 1982.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But late last year the government did take several steps that had been long been sought by its critics. The first move came during a special conference of the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu), the country's only legal party, where delegates agreed to abolish the controversial practice of &quot;queue voting.&quot; The queue system, introduced in 1986, requires voters to line up behind symbols of their preferred candidate rather than cast a secret ballot. The decision to eliminate the practice, along with several other election procedures which had been widely criticized as undemocratic, followed a lengthy plenary discussion of the findings of a Kanu review committee chaired by Vice President George Saitoti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the debate, sentiment seemed strongly opposed to the Saitoti recommendation that queues be scrapped. But after an impassioned speech by Moi in support of the Saitoti report, delegates endorsed the changes overwhelmingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The day after the conference ended, Kenya's parliament approved a constitutional amendment restoring the security of tenure to the judiciary, reversing a 1988 amendment which gave the government the authority to remove judges from the bench.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials are hopeful that the reforms will ease criticism at home and abroad. The Nairobi-based Weekly Review expressed the opinion that these actions &quot;are not the last chapter&quot; of the reform process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticisms of government practices continue, however. In a recent report, the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human Rights complained that attorneys representing unpopular clients suffer regular harassment and said Kenyan authorities are guilty of other constitutional abuses such as &quot;cruel and inhuman treatment&quot; of political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October, the U.S. Congress voted to withhold about $ 15 million in 1991 military aid for Kenya, unless the administration can certify that the Moi government has met four conditions. It must free or charge all political prisoners, end the physical abuse of prisoners, restore the independence of the judiciary and reinstate freedoms of expression. The restrictions were not applied to the $ 38 million Kenya is to receive in economic assistance this year, but the curtailments could extend to other aid if Congress remains unhappy with Moi's actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to the congressional action, Kenya's embassy in Washington protested that &quot;it must be left to Kenyans to decide at what pace and in which direction they want change to occur.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, three prominent critics charged with treason will face trial later this year. Koigi wa Wamwere, a former member of Parliament who had been living in exile in Norway, was seized in October and accused of attempting to overthrow the government by force. The government said he was found with an arms cache in Nairobi, but Koigi told the court in December he was kidnapped from neighboring Uganda. His arrest has ruptured relations between Kenya and Norway. Two lawyers arrested with Koigi -- Rumba Kinuthia and Mirugi Kariuki -- also face treason charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Moi promised decisions on the detentions of two other prominent lawyers -- Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, who have not been charged. Their cases have attracted international attention since they were picked up by police in July. But Moi has not commented on the continued jailing of Raila Odinga, son of a former Kenyan vice president, who headed the outlawed opposition Kenya African Peoples Union.  -- with files from William Acworth</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With fighting again intensifying in Rwanda, renewed efforts are underway to resolve the conflict by negotiation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting Rwanda last week, Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), called for an end to hostilities and pressed for a regional solution to the thorny problem of Rwandan refugees.  Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has announced plans to convene a summit of eastern and central African countries in Arusha, Tanzania later this month, in an effort to mediate the conflict and resolve the refugee question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rebels from the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), who launched the insurgency four months ago with an invasion from Uganda, say they are determined to force a complete change in the policies of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. &quot;There has been a total lack of democracy in our country,&quot; Patrick Mazimhaka, the Front's commissioner for foreign affairs, said in an interview last week while visiting Washington. &quot;Our objective is to change the political system, which is based on discrimination against ethnic groups,&quot; he charged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RPF's original invasion force of about 3,000 soldiers were members of the Ugandan National Army who had deserted with their uniforms, weapons and vehicles. &quot;We had to put our national interest ahead of Uganda's,&quot; Mazimhaka said. &quot;We did apologize for that, but we could not do otherwise.&quot; Most of the invaders were members of Rwanda's minority Tutsi group. But Mazimhaka claims that the front has attracted a broad following inside the country and that its fighting force has more than doubled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RPF accuses Habyarimana of favoring Hutu people over Tutsi and of reserving most opportunities for a small Hutu clique from the president's home region in the north. The front says the government's political and economic practices have forced thousands of people into exile in neighboring Uganda, Tanzania, and Burundi. In August, Habyarimana appealed to those three countries to grant citizenship to Rwandan exiles, who he said could not be accommodated in their densely populated country -- a move that some observers believe prompted the invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwanda government rejects the RPF discrimination charges and accuses the rebels of seeking restoration of the ancient Tutsi monarchy. &quot;The invasion has nothing to do with refugees,&quot; says Aloys Uwimana, the Rwandan ambassador in Washington. &quot;The invasion leaders have made clear their goal is to overthrow President Habyarimana and take over the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest strife began on January 22, with an assault against Ruhengeri, Rwanda's second largest city and the site of a major military base and prison. &quot;We opened the prison and we overran the base and captured a lot of weapons,&quot; Mazimhaka said. RPF forces are &quot;active on many small fronts&quot; in the northwest of the country, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government troops quickly recaptured Ruhengeri, and a week ago, the government announced an extensive counteroffensive aimed at reversing the rebel's gains. About 100 insurgents were killed, official sources told the Reuter news agency in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, the country's state security court sentenced eight people to death for collaborating with the rebels. In December, Justice Minister Theoeneste Mujyanama announced that over 1,500 suspected rebel sympathizers would be prosecuted. The government said its troops had forced most of the rebels to flee, following heavy clashes that left hundreds dead.  Both sides have accused the other of causing extensive casualties among civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest battles indicate a continuing combat capacity on the part of the RPF, which lost three of its most senior officers in the early days of the fighting. Among the first casualties was the invasion leader, Fred Rwigyema, a former deputy commander of the Ugandan army and advisor to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The losses were all caused on the battlefield, Mazimhaka said. He denied they were the result of internal squabbles and said the deaths reflect the fact that top commanders &quot;are with the troops in the front&quot; and are not issuing orders from the rear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the October invasion, Habyarimana has announced a series of political reforms, including abolition of the system of identity cards which the RPF has likened to South Africa's apartheid passbooks. He has promised to replace one-party rule with a multiparty system and has called for a national referendum on a new democratic constitution by June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RPF says these reforms are only window dressing. &quot;We want total abolition of discrimination in the political life of the country and a government of national unity,&quot; Mazimhaka said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE CONTINENT</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1282 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid continuing domestic and international pressure for a speed-up of democratic reforms, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire may be preparing to invite opposition politicians to join the government. The move is seen as a bid to forestall an opposition push to curtail the president's authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following an unprecedented meeting last month with Mobutu, opposition leaders announced their acceptance of a &quot;coalition&quot; government to pave the way for national elections promised for later this year. The political leaders said they expected the new government to operate independently of Mobutu, who would in effect become a figurehead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call for an interim government seems to be an attempt by the opposition to move the democratic process forward and force Mobutu's hand. The president announced last April his intention to hold the country's first elections sometime this year, and last month the government authorized 19 political parties to take part. But no date for voting has been set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu gave no indication that he would implement the opposition leaders' proposal. Instead, diplomatic sources say, he appears to be trying to coax a few of his better-known opponents to join the current government, headed by Prime Minister Lunda Bululu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if that effort succeeds, it is unlikely that other opposition figures would accept the arrangement. A government of national unity is itself a compromise position for the major opposition parties, who had made Mobutu's resignation a precondition to democratization in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people of Zaire are demanding that he go,&quot; said former cabinet minister Etienne Tshisekedi wa Malumba, the presidential candidate of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), during a visit to the United States last November. &quot;They are so disenchanted with everything he has done, they do not believe we can have democracy as long as he is there,&quot; Tshisekedi said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the maneuverings at home, Mobutu is also trying to accommodate international pressure to reform. Last month, the president was dealt a diplomatic setback when the site for next October's summit of French-speaking nations was shifted from Kinshasa to France. Canada and Belgium demanded the change as a protest against human rights abuses and widespread corruption during Mobutu's 25-year rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Paris after a meeting with French President Francois Mitterand, Mobutu criticized Canada and Belgium for forcing the transfer, but said he would accept Mitterand's new plan, which calls for Zaire to host the meeting in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mobutu juggles his options, the war in the Persian Gulf may have given him a new advantage over his critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last fall, in reaction to the Mobutu government's reported corruption and brutality, Congress cut off military aid to Zaire and required that all development assistance be dispensed through non-governmental organizations.  Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-NY) plans to introduce legislation that would endorse an &quot;interim mechanism acceptable to all political forces&quot; to oversee the transition to a democratically elected government. Solarz, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, visited Zaire in December and held talks with Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Bush administration, like its predecessors, has been reluctant to distance the U.S. from the Zaire ruler, seeing him as a reliable ally in regional and international affairs. Now, Zaire's role in diplomatic negotiations leading up to the outbreak of war has given the U.S. government leverage to press its position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, Zaire was one of three African nations sitting on the 15-member United Nations Security Council. Along with Ethiopia and Cote d'Ivoire, Zaire was courted strongly by Secretary of State James Baker as he sought to round up African support for the U.S. position on Iraq.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following month, the alphabetical rotation of the United Nations Security Council presidency put Zaire's ambassador to the United Nations, Bagbeni Nzengeya, in the chair during the crucial period of the January 15 deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The Council's near-unanimity on the Kuwait issue was put to the test, with the Zairian presiding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They ran it the way we would have wanted it run,&quot; one U.S. official said of the Zaire government's performance, &quot;and of course they have voted right all along.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently the administration is working on compromise language that it hopes will be incorporated into the Solarz resolution on Zaire's transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the political situation at an apparent stalemate, Zaire's economic dissolution has escalated. Inflation, which last year exceeded an estimated 240%, is currently running about 35% per month -- an annual rate of 420%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, public employee unions staged a three-day strike in the capital, Kinshasa, which emptied government offices, Reuters reported. The National Union of Zairean Workers, which called the strike, is demanding both higher pay for its members and the resignation of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until formation of a government which can command popular support and make economic commitments, agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank over recovery plans for the country are stymied. Delegations from both institutions visited Kinshasa in November, but neither is near an agreement with Zaire that would open the way to outside financial assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's relations with the two financial agencies was further complicated by a front-page Wall Street Journal story in December detailing questionable dealings between Zaire and a senior official in both the IMF and World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The story, by Journal reporter Edward T. Pound, revolved around Jacques de Groote, an executive director at the Bank and the IMF, with responsibility for his native Belgium, several other European nations and Turkey. The story recounts a series of actions and relationships, including a two-decade tie between de Groote and Mobutu, that suggest a conflict of interest between de Groote's professional responsibilities and his personal finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Groote has been both an official and an unofficial advisor to the Zaire leader, during a period when Zaire has been involved in complex negotiations with both the Fund and the Bank. On more than one occasion, according to the Journal, de Groote's links with Zaire and with businesses operating there have enabled him to obtain loans to help finance a lavish lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Groote told Pound that he never used his position for personal gain, but acknowledged that he was sometimes perceived as a Mobutu agent, even among his colleagues at the IMF and the Bank. Reacting to the story, Tshisekedi and other Zaire opposition leaders have called for an inquiry. Neither financial institution has made an official comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the items on the U.S. Senate's agenda for the upcoming session will be the question of who will represent U.S. interests in Kinshasa during what promises to be a turbulent time. President Bush has named career diplomat Melissa Wells as the next ambassador. No stranger to controversy, Wells is a former ambassador to Mozambique, whose appointment was delayed by lengthy confirmation queries by North Carolina Republican Senator Jesse Helms. The Senator questioned Wells' personal views as well as U.S. policy toward the Mozambique government. Once on the job, Wells proved to be broadly popular, both with the Mozambican government and among the diplomatic community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africanists agree that in Zaire, Wells will have ample opportunity to employ the diplomatic skills she exhibited in Maputo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past decade, deaths of children around the world were decreased by half, according to a report by the United Nation Children's Fund (Unicef). The report, called The State of the World's Children 1991, says a successful international campaign to immunize 80% of the world's children against preventable diseases has saved 12 million lives. At the beginning of the campaign only 15-20% of children in the developing world were being vaccinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook for Africa's children, however, is not as hopeful as that for children in other parts of the world. Many of the past decade's programs failed to reach children in Africa, and without massive debt relief and developmental assistance, there will be little improvement in the 1990s, the report says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final figures on the achievement of the 80% goal, set by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980, will not be available until March. But it is already clear, Unicef says, that the past decade's immunization programs have prevented 1.5 million children from contracting paralytic polio and millions more from contracting measles, whooping cough and neonatal tetanus. And because disease prevention reduces malnutrition, diarrhea and pneumonia, immunization also saved millions of children from chronic illness, poor growth and possible early death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While a reduction in child mortality might suggest a rise in the population growth rate, Unicef says the opposite is true. Several developing countries are approaching the threshold where lowered child deaths mean that women can place greater faith in family planning programs, Unicef says. Because mothers no longer have to bear many children to compensate for anticipated deaths, increased child survival encourages women to limit family size, resulting in millions fewer births.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heartened by the progress of the past decade, the Unicef report outlines ambitious new goals for improving child welfare in the next ten years. Drawing upon resolutions passed at the World Summit for Children last September, the Children's Fund assigns top priority to cutting child deaths by a further one-third, providing basic education for all children and halving child malnutrition and maternal deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one of the most urgent needs is to extend the immunization campaign to areas which the past decade's programs have failed to reach. Many of those are in Africa. James P. Grant, executive director of Unicef, says that Africa, with the highest average mortality rate of children under five in the world, is the only continent where child deaths are projected to increase during the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the global vaccination goal has been achieved, the report explains, not all parts of the world have been equally saturated. In addition, the report says, 80% immunization &quot;does not mean an 80% reduction in deaths, because disease is both more common, and more commonly fatal, among the minority who have not yet been reached.&quot; Although 2.5 million children were saved by vaccines in 1990, the same number of children still died from diseases preventable by immunization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A special supplement to the State of the World's Children report, Africa's Children, Africa's Future: Implementing the World Summit Declaration, indicates that Africa has the greatest proportion of threatened children of any continent. Unless downward spirals of debt, war and famine are reversed, the report says, &quot;Africa's share of global and infant deaths will increase to 40% by the end of the century.&quot; In 1950, Africa's share of child deaths was 15%, and in 1986 it was 30%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The supplemental report on African children lists interwoven factors that bind Africa into a particularly difficult situation. Several years of drought and famine during the 1980s aggravated the effects of environmental degradation, faltering economies and persistent wars. Though many African countries acted to meet the agenda for economic recovery laid out by the 1986 United Nations special session on Africa's crisis, international assistance promised by donors arrived slowly, while debt service payments rocketed.  African governments saw funds for children's programs erode steadily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emergence of the AIDS epidemic adds additional daunting layers to the problems of Africa's children. African women often lack the education to avoid contracting AIDS or are bound by tradition not to take measures against it. In early 1990, WHO estimated that of three million women worldwide -- mostly of childbearing age -- who tested positive for the AIDS antibody HIV, 80% were in sub-Saharan Africa. The virus frequently passes from mother to fetus. In ten seriously affected African countries, Unicef says, between one-quarter and one-half million children will die each year from AIDS by the year 2000, and millions more will be orphaned as their parents die of the disease. AIDS &quot;threatens to slow or even reverse the momentum generated by child survival and development initiatives during the 1980s,&quot; the supplemental report on Africa's children says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, numerous African initiatives have improved prospects for many children. Some 25 African countries have immunized an estimated 75% of their children against six main diseases, although the success rate is substantially lower in countries where wars have made rural children inaccessible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several African governments have forged links between international donors and local communities aimed at revitalizing national health systems, and some countries have seen an improvement in child and maternal nutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef also hails the signing by 41 African states of the Convention on the Rights of the Child -- a document setting forth universal standards for the survival, protection and development of children -- as an indication that child welfare is now higher on the political agenda in many African countries.  The State of the World's Children 1991 report proposes concrete debt relief and aid programs for the future, such as reductions in military spending and aid linked to investments in child development. It also calls for a broad &quot;new ethic for children&quot; in all countries that would carry the momentum of the World Summit into policies that place concern for children first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The...child cannot wait until interest rates fall, or until commodity prices recover,...or until a war has ended,&quot; Unicef says. &quot;The child has only one chance to grow normally in mind and body, and protecting that one chance should have first call on our resources -- in good times and in bad.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unicef officials concede that the &quot;new ethic for children&quot; the organization wants to implement is revolutionary. But in Africa, they say, it will take a revolution of world priorities to ensure that the continent's children fare better in the 1990s than they did in the last ten years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How fertile the land is,&quot; says South African constitutional scholar Albie Sachs, &quot;in posing problems!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The belief that the greatest challenges are still ahead dominated discussions of South Africa's future last week, following President F.W. de Klerk's February 1 pledge to scrap the major laws that have become known as the cornerstones of apartheid -- the Land Acts, the Group Areas Act and the Population Registration Act. De Klerk told the opening session of parliament in Cape Town that &quot;South Africa cannot allow or permit the dynamic process of reform to slow down.&quot; Parliament is expected to approve de Klerk's proposals by July 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the inclusion of the population registration laws was a surprise, the removal of the land and group areas legislation was expected, and South Africans have been wrestling with the implications for some time. Amid the proposals and debates about how to structure the political economy of the country, there is widespread recognition that the rising expectations of the impoverished black majority will not be met easily.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fundamental problem of scarcity of resources in relation to the infinity of needs will be the same,&quot; economist Simon Brand said in December, &quot;whether it is decided to move towards a more centrally directed or a more market-oriented economy.&quot; Brand, who heads the quasi-governmental Development Bank of Southern Africa, said the general public needs to be told &quot;that there are no magic solutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the dismantling of the most important vestiges of South Africa's race laws holds a potent symbolism. It was a Friday morning in June 1913, when Africans learned that seven percent of South Africa's land had been reserved for their occupation. The 1913 Land Act was the first absolute legal barrier between areas for black and white residence. Thirty-three years later, the Development Trust and Land Act set aside 13.6% of South Africa's total area for black use and restricted black squatting in areas reserved for whites -- a provision that has allowed evictions and demolitions of black homes to continue. Collectively known as &quot;the Land Acts,&quot; the 1913 and 1936 laws and associated regulations created a landless majority and fueled resistance to white rule over the years. The Group Areas Act of 1950, a complex piece of legislation that similarly restricts the rights of &quot;Coloureds&quot; and Indians, completed the division of the country into separate areas for each racial group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1982, an estimated 1.3 million people had lost their rights to land in white areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A study for South Africa's Urban Foundation, a business-supported organization, says that the country's race laws systematically undermined black agriculture, resulting in extensive poverty. &quot;By 1990,&quot; says the study on rural development, &quot;80% of the households in the rural and dense settlement areas received incomes below the MML,&quot; a measure of basic subsistence needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The land issue is a central part of the problem of inequity that South Africa now faces, says Max Sisulu, an economic planner for the African National Congress (ANC). &quot;Whites control 95% of the economy,&quot; Sisulu says. &quot;The struggle for a democratic South Africa will focus increasingly on the economic sphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question that occupies South African strategists is how to satisfy the land hunger of the country's black population, while maintaining the productivity of the country's farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa is one of a handful of African countries that produces enough food for its population and, by current standards of calculation, it became one of the world's six producers of cheapest foods during the 1980s. But many economists say the country has paid a high hidden price for that achievement, both in an underlying structural imbalance that is unsustainable over the long term and in ecological damage that will haunt farmers for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper presented last October to a London conference on land reform, Development Bank manager Nicholas Christodoulou said that a quarter of white farming areas suffer from erosion and that irrigated land is being degraded through salination, while acid rain is a growing concern. Population pressures in the crowded black areas makes land conditions there even worse.  Across-the-board improvement in land use policy is needed, Christodoulou told the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Urban Foundation report concurs. &quot;To continue with present policy,&quot; it says, &quot;is to invite demographic distortions, deepening poverty, increasing polarization and inefficient utilization of national resources.&quot; But the question of what should replace present practices is a complex one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC Freedom Charter, a document of principles that has guided the anti-apartheid struggle since 1956, declares that the &quot;land shall be owned by those who work it&quot; -- a statement that raises, for white farmers, the specter of their land being seized and turned over to their farm laborers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But today's planners see the process of land reform as a balancing act that brings blacks into the farm economy over time, without disrupting smoothly running farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those looking for formulas are economists at the Development Bank. Christoulou listed seven models for the transfer of land to black ownership, including repossession of heavily indebted farms, negotiating for use of church-owned land, making use of small plots around urban areas, and making available the land held in government trusts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the more significant indications that Bank thinking may meet land activists halfway, Christodoulou acknowledged that &quot;the history of forced removals in South Africa is inextricably linked with the way in which the agricultural sector has developed.&quot; As a result, the Bank official said, the state should return to dispossessed blacks any land still in government hands, and should consider establishing legal procedures to adjudicate conflicting claims to land that is in private hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such statements indicate that government negotiators may be prepared to entertain both the calls for immediate action on certain cases of dispossession and the ANC's proposals for a system of land courts to hear grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aninka Claassens, a field worker for the Transvaal Rural Action Committee, foresees a land policy that is radical in its break with racial ownership patterns, but gradual in its implementation. The pace of change, Claassens told the journal Work in Progress, should be tied to the ability of people to mobilize and organize to lay claim to parcels of land. Claassens thinks absentee-owned farms might be targets for early transfer from white to black ownership. A process that rests on the ability of farmers and communities to work the land they receive, Claassens says, would be least likely to disrupt food supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All parties share a concern to maintain and increase agricultural productivity. Although there are no hard data on land ownership, there are an estimated 79,000 white commercial farmers and 800,000 black smallholders operating at subsistence levels, according to Christodoulou. Skeptics about land reform say that black farms tend to be poorly run and inefficient, and they warn of economic disaster if land is redistributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a number of groups that have been studying the constraints on black farm production say that there are ways to address those concerns. For the last five years, the Development Bank has been financing agricultural support programs for rural farmers, with what it says are encouraging results.  &quot;The perception that blacks can't farm and that people can't make a living on small pieces of land in South Africa is a fallacy,&quot; Bank manager Johan Kruger told the Washington Post's Allister Sparks. &quot;Provided they have the necessary support services and infrastructure, black farmers have shown that they can farm as well as whites.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such support services are the topic of several reports on the future of South African agriculture. A paper presented last March to a rural land workshop, sponsored by the Institute for a Democratic South Africa, surveyed the history of the state role in agriculture. State intervention on behalf of white farmers has produced a high level of efficiency, the report said, but also a low level of equity. If support services were extended to African farmers, it said, they could be productive, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Development Bank's Simon Brand agrees. The government, he says &quot;has played a much more pervasive role in the South African economy than some proponents of the free market view would have one believe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the pressure for redressing economic inequalities, Brand says, it is &quot;unlikely that the share of government in the use of resources in the economy and the extent of its intervention in the economy will decline significantly.&quot; It is the direction rather than the size of state intervention that needs adjustment, Brand says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the roles government might assume is that of watchdog over private transactions. Some land rights activists have said that the end of racially reserved land could actually reduce black ownership, by putting land previously reserved for blacks on an open market where only whites could afford to buy. And reformers argue that the mere removal of legal barriers will, in itself, do little to change South Africa's residential and farming patterns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one wrestling with these issues argues that they can be resolved quickly or without pain. The debate presupposes the existence of a democratic government that will be forced to balance economic prudence with its accountability to a new, broader constituency. But that, in itself, is a sign that increasing numbers of South Africans of all races now believe that the process of ending apartheid is -- as Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said in response to the de Klerk speech -- &quot;nearly irreversible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That view is not unanimous, however. White farmers warn that they will defy any plan that gives blacks the franchise in a unitary state or that takes white land for black use. Members of the right-wing Conservative Party stormed out of Parliament when President de Klerk unveiled his legislative proposals, and Conservative leader Andries Treurnicht said that &quot;there is land in South Africa which belongs to whites and we have a claim to that land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an apparent attempt to defuse trouble from the white community, President de Klerk took the novel step of placing ads in Sunday newspapers following his speech. The full-page ads showed a dove of peace with the slogan: &quot;Politicians can work out a new South Africa, but they can't make it work -- only you can do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Renamo rebels stepped up attacks on key government roads and ports last month, the tenuous December 1 ceasefire that had slowed Mozambique's 15-year civil war seems increasingly in danger. Since late February, Renamo has reportedly ambushed a convoy traveling through western Tete province, raided a railway linking Malawi to the Mozambican port of Nacala and attacked Mozambican troops along the Limpopo railway line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the fifth round of Rome peace talks between Renamo and the Mozambique government in January, the rebels rejected the findings of the Joint Verification Commission (JVC), an 11-nation panel monitoring the ceasefire.  After investigations, the JVC found Renamo responsible for several early violations of the accord. Renamo claimed the government had broken the accord first, by allowing Zimbabwe to continue stationing troops throughout the country. The ceasefire agreement required that Zimbabwean troops would be limited to the Beira and Limpopo corridors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to disagreement over the JVC report, repre-sentatives at the Rome talks failed to discuss the future political situation. President Joaquim Chissano of the Mozambique ruling party, Frelimo, announced last year that elections would be open to all political parties, including Renamo. Several other groups have said they intend to challenge Frelimo in elections, scheduled for this year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After a second round of peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the rebel Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) deadlocked in Washington in late February, the EPLF launched a new assault on the regime of President Mengistu Haile Mariam. An alliance of rebel groups scored major victories throughout March, and now lie poised to strike from Mezezo, a town close to the government's lifeline road to the Red Sea, only1 100 miles north of the capital,Addis Ababa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The offensive has posed the most serious threat yet to Mengistu's embattled government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. State Department said non-essential embassy personnel are leaving Addis after being granted &quot;voluntary departure status&quot; last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPLF, which has been fighting for the independence of Eritrea since 1961, has formed a loose coalition with other rebel groups, operating under the umbrella of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), in the common push to oust Mengistu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main EPRDF group, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), has captured the northern regional capital of Gondar and all of the Gojam province since late February. The group already controls Tigray and parts of Wallaga, Wollo and Shoa provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mengistu's troops are reportedly outnumbered and low on fuel and supplies. Last month, the president drafted students from the university in Addis Ababa to bolster government forces guarding Ethiopia's last remaining port at Assab.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African drive for greater pluralism and accountability in its political systems was spurred by the democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe, and boosted powerfully by the dramatic release of Nelson Mandela and the legalization of political parties in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the process of enlarging political freedoms in Africa was initiated before these events. In 1989, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) issued the &quot;African Alternative Framework to Structural Adjustment Programs&quot; as a counter to World Bank and International Monetary Fund-sponsored economic reforms. The African proposals for economic recovery explicitly linked the continent's prospects for economic recovery to the introduction of democratic reforms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the urging of African grassroots organizations, the ECA hosted a major international conference on that theme in Arusha, Tanzania a year ago, where delegates adopted a far-reaching &quot;African Charter for Popular Participation in Development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That and other conferences and meetings acknowledged that African political systems were in crisis, often unable to respond to the variety of urgent economic needs of their people, and that the prospects for external resources to ease this crisis were gloomy. Mobilizing both the energies and resources of the general population came to be seen as an important determinant in reviving economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although agitation for greater political freedoms is not new in Africa, most previous movements for change have been contained in one way or another. &quot;What is new,&quot; says Olara Otunnu, a former Ugandan foreign minister who heads the New York-based International Peace Academy, &quot;is the sense of confidence and legitimacy with which the democratic demand is being made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That maturing of political protests, has combined with the economic pressures on most Africa governments, to speed the pace of political reform.  Although analysts agree that the single most important factor is popular action, many governments have recognized their inability to meet the twin challenges of domestic economic decline and international geopolitical changes. In country after country, authorities responded to large-scale demonstrations, general strikes, bread riots or violent upheaval by formulating, or agreeing to the need for, multiparty constitutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even before Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, it was clear that the external assistance that has been seen as crucial to Africa's efforts to revive economic and social growth would be in short supply. The much awaited &quot;peace dividend&quot; -- resources freed by the end of the Cold War arms race -- would be directed not towards the world's poorest countries, but back towards Eastern Europe. Even whatever strategic significance Africa was accorded in the super-power rivalry for influence fell away. In addition, Africa's puny -- and still declining -- contribution to international trade has made it seem less and less relevant to the economic interests of richer nations. And the growth of regional economic entities such as the European Economic Community is a further threat to the small, divided economies of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The awareness of that marginalization has helped to moderate African government responses to demands for increased democracy. But the end of the story is not written yet. Some countries still strongly resist change. And Cameroonian historian Achille Mbembe warns that &quot;there is reason to fear that reforms underway in several countries may be cosmetic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is predictable, though, is that there are no quick fixes. While political reforms are vital in the long term for economic revival in Africa, they are unlikely to yield swift results. And economic reforms that are introduced without popular participation or support will lead only to increased turmoil.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN -- Two of Africa's longest serving leaders were ousted last week -- one by efree election, the other by the troops he dispatched to quell pro-democracy demonstrations in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Benin elections, which voted out dictator Mathieu Kerekou, and the overthrow of Malian strongman Moussa Traore by his own soldiers, who pledged to meet the protestors and establish &quot;total democracy,&quot; were twin signs of the revolutionary changes sweeping West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, protests have forced President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to abandon one-party rule in Cote d'Ivoire and convinced his counterparts in Togo, Gabon, and Cameroon to pledge similar reforms. Popular pressure in Congo spawned a national conference now underway in Brazzaville to reform the country's single-party political system.  And last month in the Cape Verde islands, the 16-year rule of the PAIGC -- the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde, which led the fight against Portuguese colonialism -- was ended by the victory of Carlos Veiga's Movement for Democracy in the country's first multiparty elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ghana and Nigeria, where national governments say they are gradually introducing democratic systems that will be strong enough to endure future assaults, pressure for faster, more extensive reforms is strong and growing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The domino effect is clearly at work, as economically-pressed Africans see their neighbors win political concessions. Benin's election is particularly riveting, since Kerekou represented the generation of aging rulers whose tenures are coming to an end.  &quot;He's out,&quot; exulted Afiwae Akapko from Togo, as she watched the news from Benin on her employer's television in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire's capital, where she came to find work. &quot;Eyadema will be next!&quot; she says, referring to Togolese ruler Gnassingbe Eyadema, who has been under siege in the last two weeks by protests that left at least two people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the killings, Eyadema abandoned his long opposition to reforms and agreed to a quick transition to multiparty democracy, a general amnesty for political prisoners and exiled opponents, and a national political conference to chart the country's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One factor in Eyadema's new tolerance may be signals from the government of France that it will not intervene to put down the protests, as it often has in past disturbances in former French colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France also has come to the aid of President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire during past insurrections in that former Belgian colony. But last April, Mobutu caved in to demands for opposition parties, and more than 60 are now vying for influence amid the country's economic collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some countries, such as Kenya, have resisted the trend towards multiple parties entirely, arguing that single-party rule has helped discourage political divisions along ethnic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Multiparty advocates counter that ethnic hostilities have festered in single-party states, as in Benin. There, supporters of Kerekou went on a rampage last week after their man won only 32% of the vote in the country's first contested presidential election. The winner, with 68%, was Nicephore Soglo, a 57-year-old former World Bank official who has served as provisional prime minister since Kerekou loosened his hold on power during protests early last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said thousands of people fled the Benin capital Cotonou and that others sought refuge at police stations and military camps when Kerekou loyalists began attacking people from the south of the country. Kerekou's power base was in the north, and critics have long claimed that his policies exacerbated ethnic tensions by favoring his own area. Dissidents, many from the south, were frequently tortured and killed by Benin's security forces, according to charges by Amnesty International, the London-based Human Rights organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benin, a former French colony that became the independent nation of Dahomey in 1960, experienced six coups in its first 12 years, until Kerekou seized control 21 years ago. In the wake of the post-election violence that killed several people and wounded several dozen, many worried about reports that the army did little to stop the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Mali, where President Moussa Traore's one-man rule ended last week after 22 years, the army did an about-face. Following anti-government protests that left an estimated 200 people dead in four days of demonstrations, the military defied orders to suppress the continuing unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The army will no longer meddle in politics,&quot; said Col. Amadou Toumani in a radio broadcast to the nation after leading a coup against Traore. &quot;The army will return to its barracks,&quot; he promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public reaction was jubilant. In an interview on Mali state radio, human rights lawyer Demba Diallo said the &quot;patriotic officers&quot; who overthrew Traore had already consulted opposition leaders from the Committee of Pro-Democracy Associations. The soldiers' intention &quot;is not to take power,&quot; Diallo said, but to &quot;insure that Tuniform' no longer usurps the people's power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But human rights activists cautioned the celebrating crowds against reprisals of their own. Medical personnel who wanted to remain anonymous told the Associated Press that a top Traore official and the president's brother-in-law had been burned to death, apparently by government opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Traore himself is reported to be in the hands of coup leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march to democratic government in Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria, has been both more raucous and more peaceful, under the military government of President Ibrahim Babangida. With the conduct of a census last month -- a delicate undertaking in a country where both religious and ethnic questions loom large -- Nigeria is entering the final phase of a multi-year transition to civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians have long been accustomed to speaking their minds, and the country's press is among the continent's most contentious. Last week's announcement that forthcoming elections would be by queuing, or lining up, instead of by secret ballot, prompted predictable media outrage. But government officials said that corruption had become so ingrained in the Nigerian political process that only open voting could assure the public that elections were fair as well as free.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OUGADOUGOU -- Every two years, the capital of Burkina Faso becomes the film capital of Africa during the week-long Ouagadougou Pan-African Cinema Festival. Beginning in late February, during the heart of the Sahelian dry season, the brown and dusty landscape of Ouagadougou is transformed by the brilliant blue, green and yellow posters, billboards, and banners displayed on every street corner and available building. &quot;Fespaco is the Environment,&quot; proclaims a banner trumpeting the environmental theme of this year's festival -- the twelfth cinema gathering here since the first one in 1969.  This year the downtown area was closed to all motorized traffic, including the city's ubiquitous population of mopeds, to make way for a huge open-air crafts market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The estimated 300,000 people Fespaco attracts are a mixture of international media moguls and local film buffs -- all here to see Africa as viewed by the continent's most talented film and television professionals.  Although the commercial opportunities created by the visitors is important to Burkina Faso -- one of the world's poorest countries -- and special care was obviously taken to please the outsiders, Fespaco is a festival for the people of Ouagadougou as much as for the visiting film world.  And the widespread public participation generated a sense of excitement during the festival that was felt throughout the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There literally is something for everyone at Fespaco.  While famous filmmakers were attending the gala opening with President Blaise Campaore in a modern air conditioned theater, the less affluent but no less cinema-mad general population was watching movies at the many open-air showings across the capital. Movie and television directors sat under palm trees next to the pool at the posh Hotel Independence, discussing the intricacies of various productions, but local inhabitants could be found sitting on street corners discussing the same films with equal enthusiasm. While visiting tourists bought traditional African crafts at the street fairs, Burkinabe were purchasing children's clothes from Pakistan at one of the two non-African craft booths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides films that addressed environmental issues, many of the submissions dealt with a variety of other pressing concerns in present day Africa, such as the role of woman in society. The diversity of films and television programs at this year's festival offered spectators the rare opportunity to glimpse scenes of an entire continent without having to leave Ouagadougou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two of the most talked-about films were from the same filmmaker, Idrissa Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso. The festival opened with Karim and Sala, Ouedraogo's most recent work -- so recent that some of the film's scenes shot in Ouagadougou had Fespaco billboards in the background. Shot largely in the country's two urban centers, Ouagadougou and Bobo Dioulasso, the film follows the lives and friendship of two children as they struggle through the seemingly mad adult urban world. A &quot;light&quot; movie by most standards, it depicts Ouedraogo's vision of a world where dreams come true, where families win lotteries, children overcome all hardships, and improbable coincidences restore separated families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The setting and the message of Ouedraogo's other festival film, Tilai, were vastly different. Filmed entirely in rural Burkina Faso, the story revolves around serious topics such as incest, fratricide, forbidden love, and traditional honor. Already the winner of the special Jury Prize at Cannes in 1990, Tilai captured Fespaco's top prize, the Yennenga Stallion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film that many had predicted might win this year's Yennenga, but didn't, turned out to be one of the festival's biggest crowd pleasers: Halfaouine, a Tunisian film directed by Ferid Boughedir. Transporting audiences half a continent away for a tale of an adolescent boy's interaction in the very disparate cultures of male and female Tunisia, Halfaouine had the backing of many critics. But Ouedraogo was a sentimental choice, whose prize seemed to represent both his own well-regarded body of work and the predominant role his impoverished country has played in the promotion of African film.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MONROVIA -- Tejan Cole has big plans for the future. As soon as he can get a calculator, a typewriter, a desk and a chair, he intends to restart the accounting firm he ran before civil war disrupted commerce and drove him from his home last summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with one eye on the future, Cole is preoccupied with unfinished business from the past. He desperately wants to find out whether his wife and 10-year-old daughter are alive or dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many Liberian families, the Coles were separated in fighting that raged throughout the country when rebel groups took on troops loyal to then-President Samuel K. Doe. During the rebel advance into the capital, Monrovia, in August, Cole was caught on the side controlled by government forces, while his wife and daughter were trapped in an area that was overtaken by rebels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eight months later, Liberia remains a divided country. Monrovia is administered by an interim government under the security umbrella of a 7,000 strong West African peacekeeping force. The rest of this Ohio-size nation, falls behind lines controlled by the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the movement led by Charles Taylor, a former government bureaucrat who launched an insurgency against Doe in late 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two people have told Cole that his wife and daughter were among the civilians killed by one of the warring factions. But he refuses to accept the news until the roads out of the capital are opened and he can investigate for himself.  Cole wants to believe that his family fled to another part of the country during the battle for Monrovia. &quot;I haven't given up hope that I will see them one day,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Taylors troops allowing few people to cross the dividing lines, Liberia has been unable to tally its dead. A Liberian relief group estimates that 30,000 people have been killed, while other guesses run much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physical damage caused by the heavy fighting is pervasive. Many homes and buildings have been seriously damaged or destroyed, most are marked with bullet holes, and virtually every structure has been ransacked. Evidence of widespread pillaging endures in the looted goods displayed for sale on every sidewalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the three months since the West African troops imposed a cease-fire in Monrovia, life has slowly regained a measure of normalcy. Markets are bustling with people, several restaurants are serving meals, and shops and other businesses have begun to reopen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alli and Mary Johnson were among the first shopkeepers to start again.  Their little stand on the beach was burned down, so in December they rented a stall at the corner of Newport Street and Sekou Toure Avenue and began selling a few goods. They called the stall &quot;Check Point,&quot; because it stood beside a guard post that was maintained by one of the armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The location is near a more affluent area known as Mamba Point -- site of the American embassy, the United Nations relief operation, and several non-governmental assistance groups. But the Johnsons' clientele is almost exclusively from the neighborhood, and the biggest selling item is palm wine -- the alcoholic beverage of choice for those unable to afford the imported products now making their way onto the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heineken beer, selling at Check Point for about $ 3 a can, moves more slowly. A limited selection of food, including flour, sugar, bread, and tea, is also on the shelves. A loaf of bread now sells for about 25 cents, less than a fifth the price of a few weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A larger variety of goods has begun appearing on the shelves of the bigger Lebanese-run grocery stores, such as Delbani Supermarket in the center of town. Renovations at the back are in progress, while shelves in the front of the shop display over four dozen items. Store manager Edward Ayub says that when he resumed business at the end of February, he offered less than a quarter of the items he has now, and prices were much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For most residents of the city, food prices are still out of reach.  Almost no one is formally employed. The entire interim government is working on a volunteer basis, because no funds were left in the national treasury after the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since late September, food has been reaching the population through a relief effort coordinated by the United Nations and the U.S.-based Catholic Relief Services. Rice, beans, cooking oil, and modest quantities of fish supplied by the United States government and the UN World Food Program are being distributed by a locally led group known as SELF (Special Emergency Life Food Program).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dorothea Diggs, who co-founded SELF with three other Liberians, says the aim was to create a distribution program that could supply everyone equitably and minimize opportunities for fraud. &quot;We want to show that we can do this without being corrupt,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SELF volunteers conducted a house-by-house survey that numbered over 46,000 dwellings and compiled a computerized registry of their occupants. When a food distribution takes place -- there have been six since late September -- a representative of each household must come to one of 140 neighborhood centers SELF established to collect the household's certified allotment. Everyone in the house is entitled to an equal share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the food system in place and working smoothly, SELF is now preparing for the next phase. &quot;We are making plans for productive resettlement of people,&quot; says Blamoh Nelson, another co-founder of the group. &quot;We want to move beyond free gifts to encourage people to be productive even under the difficult conditions here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Working alongside foreign relief groups, SELF is preparing to expand its efforts to Liberia's interior. Several organizations are providing assistance to the concentrations of refugees on the country's borders with Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Cote d'Ivoire. But there is believed to be an urgent need for food and medical care in parts of the country that have been inaccessible to outside help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step towards opening the roads was taken early last month with a series of &quot;confidence visits&quot; organized by the West African peacekeeping force. Members of the armed factions along with journalists and other observers traveled to Charles Taylor's headquarters at Gbarnga and to other towns behind rebel lines, where they were greeted with welcoming shouts of &quot;We want peace,&quot; and &quot;No More War.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roadblocks dividing the two sides went back up as soon as the visits were concluded, but negotiations are underway to expand the security cordon from the capital to other parts of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for expanding the relief efforts got a boost with the arrival two weeks ago of the &quot;Harbel Tapper,&quot; a large ocean freighter leased by Firestone Rubber Company to bring food, medicines and clothing for war victims, along with vehicles and other materials needed to re-start the firm's rubber plantations at Harbel. The Ohio-based company has been a major presence and a potent symbol of American involvement in Liberia since 1926 .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're very happy to have arrived back with 3,000 tons of relief cargo for the needy of this country,&quot; said D.A. Ensminger, the American manager of Firestone's Liberia subsidiary, as he watched four big cranes offload the goods. He and the rest of the Firestone management were forced out of the country by fighting last July. This month, the company is sending the ship to bring another 6,000 tons of supplies from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, 500 miles down the Atlantic Coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Along with 143,000 bags of rice, beans, and peas, the Harbel Tapper left Baltimore, Maryland with two dozen 20-foot-long wooden crates filled with clothes, medical supplies, and canned wares collected in the U.S. by the Liberian Committee for Relief, Resettlement, and Reconstruction. The committee has joined forces with the United Methodist Church of Liberia to provide the vital supplies to day care facilities, schools and clinics, which have become gathering points for the most needy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The whole idea is to involve Liberians directly in disseminating these things,&quot; says James Holder, executive director of the relief committee.  &quot;As appreciative as we are for what foreigners have come in and done, we have to take initiative ourselves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holder, who is serving as interim minister of commerce, believes involvement in relief work can offer local people &quot;hands-on&quot; experience, which he hopes can help spark future development. &quot;Liberians have to take the ball and carry it,&quot; he says. &quot;As bad as our situation has become, we now have the opportunity to start from scratch and do things right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But outside help will be critical to cope with the current emergency.  Preliminary assessments suggest that the civil war has brought food production to a halt. &quot;Our farmers, who are 70% of our people, lost their crops, their homes, their tools, and their seeds,&quot; says Dr. Nah-do Bropleh, interim agriculture minister. Liberia, which used to be a major seed supplier for the entire region, now urgently needs seeds itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country will be dependent on food aid for at least two years, Bropleh says. &quot;Our priority is to be able to feed ourselves as quickly as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of reconstruction will be huge, but SELF director Diggs sees signs that the rebuilding process has begun. &quot;For all the destruction in Liberia, people are going to their houses and cleaning up the mess in places you would not even want to go. It will take a lot of time to get out of this fix, but we have the courage to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Tejan Cole, starting over will not be easy. He lost everything he owned when both his accounting office and his home were looted during the fighting. But even as he worries about his wife and daughter, he is looking forward to expanding his firm to include public relations work. &quot;There will be a lot of opportunities,&quot; he says. &quot;People will want to set their businesses up right.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1152 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MONROVIA-- &quot;We are here for peace,&quot; said Dr. Toga MacIntosh, as he led the delegation from Liberia's main rebel group into the opening of the All-Liberian National Conference. &quot;We will not walk out of this meeting without an agreement on conditions for a lasting peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, after 10 days of negotiations, the rebels walked out, taking with them hopes for an early resolution of the civil war that has left Liberia in ruins. Although the MacIntosh delegates promised to return in a week and assured Liberians that the current ceasefire will remain in effect, their departure heightened fears that a peaceful agreement to end the 15-month long conflict may prove impossible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia has been wracked by violence and famine since December, 1989, when former civil servant Charles Taylor launched his insurgency with about two dozen men. His National Patriotic Front for the Liberation of Liberia (NPFL) attracted broad popular support that swelled its ranks to thousands of fighters and led to the assassination of dictator Samuel K. Doe. But conflicts between rebels and remnants of Doe's army, and between the NPFL and a breakaway faction led by former Taylor lieutenant Prince Yormi Johnson, reduced much of the capital to rubble, killed tens of thousands of people across the country, and forced more than half the country's 2.6 million people to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Monrovia meeting was convened by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) which intervened to stop the destruction. Three months ago, an army of soldiers from five Ecowas nations managed to enforce a ceasefire. Under protection of the peacekeepers, known as Ecomog -- for Ecowas Monitoring Group, representatives of six political parties and 14 civic, professional and religious organizations joined rival rebel factions in the peace talks, aimed at establishing a framework for democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first days of the conference were devoted to lengthy wrangling over accreditation and procedural matters. The NPFL said the conference was dominated by &quot;exiled politicians&quot; with no popular base in the electorate. Other participants accused Taylor's group of stalling and of maneuvering to grab power by force. Last week's walkout came after the NPFL unsuccessfully sought an adjournment to allow consideration of the group's proposal that Charles Taylor be named co-president of an interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor himself stayed away from Monrovia, citing &quot;confirmed intelligence reports&quot; of a plot on his life, but insisting that he has earned the right to leadership by his role in ousting Doe, who came to power in a 1980 military coup. The current interim government is headed by Dr. Amos C. Sawyer, a former university dean who was teaching at the University of Indiana when he was chosen provisional president by a gathering of Liberian groups held in Banjul, Gambia. Taylor boycotted that session, which took place during the height of the fighting in Monrovia last August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Monrovia talks are designed to meet Taylor's demand for a national conference inside Liberia. Foreign ministers or other senior officials from seven neighboring countries have participated in the early deliberations. The Ecowas representatives negotiated the selection of three prominent Liberians to chair the sessions: Roman Catholic Archbishop Michael Francis, Muslim Council leader Sheikh Kafumba Konneh, and retired Ambassador Herbert Brewer, a former envoy to Washington and London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Taylor's refusal to attend suggested failure from the beginning, and the west African mediators set out to try to win his cooperation. Nigerian Foreign Minister Ike Nwachukwu held an unannounced hour-long session with Taylor on March 16, the day after the conference opened, in Kakata, 45 miles from the capital. Ecowas Secretary General Abbas Bundu and Togolese Foreign Minister Yaovi Adodo also made successive trips to see the NPFL chief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ecomog has done everything to bring him down here in security, but security is very personal,&quot; Adodo said after his meeting with Taylor. Special arrangements were made to insure Taylor's safety, the diplomats said -- in addition to the roadblocks in place all around the conference center and the body searches of all participants as they enter the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few here would dispute Taylor's assertion that he could be a target for his rival Prince Johnson. In September, Johnson's group captured Doe when the president ventured out of his heavily fortified Executive Mansion for a visit to Ecomog headquarters. Doe was tortured and killed, and many here are convinced that Johnson would like to eliminate Taylor as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a number of peace talk participants, the first sign that Taylor was ready to enter serious negotiations came at the end of the opening week when his delegation proposed the creation of a three-person ruling council to replace the interim government and lead Liberia towards elections. In a telephone interview with the BBC, Taylor said the council should include himself, a representative of the interim government, and a &quot;neutral&quot; person acceptable to both sides. Previously, Taylor opposed any role for the interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most conference delegates rejected the NPFL compromise. The Banjul peace plan specifies that no leader of an armed faction can head the interim government and stipulates that neither the interim president nor vice-president can be a presidential candidate in national elections slated for late this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, in an attempt to forge a transitional arrangement acceptable to all sides, a nine-person conference committee proposed the creation of two vice presidential posts in the interim government -- one for a representative from each rebel movement. Like the Banjul plan, the committee's blueprint offers Taylor himself the post of speaker of the legislative assembly, the most senior position in the interim government that would leave him eligible to contest the presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee said national elections should be held in October and that the tenure of the interim government should expire in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the departure of the NPFL delegation, and the general acknowledgment that no peace scheme can succeed without Taylor's involvement, the conference proceeded to consider the committee report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Liberians remain fearful of Taylor's intentions. &quot;Everybody was supporting Taylor at the beginning,&quot; says the Rev. Dixon Kumeh, a delegate representing the Liberia Council of Churches. But Kumeh now believes that &quot;Taylor can never be president&quot; because of the widespread atrocities attributed to his supporters and his refusal to halt the fighting after Doe's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been too much bloodletting,&quot; says interim president Sawyer.  &quot;No one would feel secure with one of the military factions at the head of an interim government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN -- New initiatives are underway to find a solution to Liberia's bloody civil war, which has cost thousands of Liberian lives, crossed the border into Sierra Leone and threatens to widen into a regional conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats from the 16-nation Economic Community of West Africa (Ecowas), which has a peacekeeping force in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, are exploring possible actions to end the stalement that has divided Liberia into two camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the interim government, operating from Monrovia under the protection of the 7,000-strong west African force, is seeking to gain recognition from its neighbors and from key world powers like the United States. A delegation from the interim government visiting Washington earlier this month to seek closer cooperation and ask U.S. assistance in settling court claims which have frozen all of Liberia's assets in foreign banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-CA), chairman of the House Africa subcommittee, is trying to break the political deadlock by convening a meeting of the two Liberian sides. He is seeking to bring together the president of the interim government, Amos Sawyer, and rebel leader Charles Taylor, who has refused to cooperate with the Monrovia administration. The Congressman saw both men during a one-day visit to Liberia last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor heads a regime heaquartered in Gbanga, 125 miles from Monrovia, which claims control over 90 percent of the country. As the leader of the insurgency launched at the end of 1989 that resulted in the death last September of former President Samuel K. Doe, Taylor says he has earned the right to lead the country until elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Taylor's forces clashed with troops from Sierra Leone along the two countries' common border. Sierra Leone has accused Taylor's troops of invading and capturing a number of border towns. Taylor denies his men have attacked Sierra Leone, saying the fighting is caused by opponents of the country's president, Joseph Momoh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many of the governments in the area believe Taylor is behind the trouble, including recent clashes in nearby Guinea. Sierra Leonean troops form part of the west African force in Monrovia, which Taylor believes was sent to keep him from seizing the capital. He had earlier vowed to attack the airport in the Sierra Leonean capital, Freetown, the staging base for supplying the west African monitoring force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria and Guinea, two other members of the Ecowas Monitoring Group, known as Ecomog, have sent troops to assist Sierra Leone's poorly equipped and lightly trained army. Momoh is also seeking aid from the United States and Great Britain, and both have indicated a willingness to supply materiel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West African diplomats think Taylor wants to undermine Ecowas willingness to maintain the troops in Monrovia, and they say his armed men include dissidents from several of the surrounding countries. Taylor further alienated Ecowas members when he refused to attend or fully cooperate with an All-Liberia conference convened by the west African governments to work out a peace plan for the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A sixth round of talks between the Mozambican government and the Renamo rebel movement has begun in Rome, under the sponsorship of the Roman Catholic Church and the Italian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With mediators saying last week that the two sides were close to agreement, hopes are rising for an end to the brutal conflict. Fifteen years of Renamo attacks have destroyed much of Mozambique's productive capacity and social infrastructure and caused losses estimated at $ 15 billion in a country ranked as one of the three poorest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last year, the government of President Joaquim Chissano obtained National Assembly approval for sweeping constitutional changes, including all the political reforms demanded by Renamo as conditions for ending the fighting. Mozambique now has a multiparty political system, secret ballot elections, and private property ownership and other personal liberties enshrined in law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several opposition parties have already formed to challenge the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo), which led the independence campaign and has governed since 1975. Among the new groupings are the Mozambique National Union, made up of former Renamo members, the Mozambique National Movement, headed by Maximo Dias, and the Liberal Democratic Party, known as Palmo, now headed by Martin Bilal. Palmo has stirred controversy by advocating job and other preferences for &quot;original Mozambicans&quot; -- a stand sharply at odds with Frelimo's policy of strict equality of treatment for all Mozambicans, including whites and those of mixed-ancestry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During Palmo's first party congress this month, Casimiro Nhamitambo, a founding member who had been favored as a presidential candidate, reportedly walked out in a dispute with other leaders, promising to set up a new political organization along the same anti-socialist lines as Palmo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the war continues. A partial cease-fire agreement late last year broke down in February, with incidents that included attacks on famine relief efforts. A 10-nation verification panel established to monitor the accord blamed Renamo for the violations. The United States government, which serves on the panel, condemned Renamo's refusal to observe the pact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of Renamo's structure and objectives have always been murky.  Established in the mid-1970s by the white Rhodesian intelligence service to undermine Mozambique's support for the Zimbabwe independence forces, Renamo became a ward of South African military intelligence when Zimbabwe gained its independence in 1980. In 1984, South Africa signed a non-aggression pact with Mozambique, pledging to end all support for the rebels. But Renamo supply lines remained open.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ongoing fighting has left a sizeable portion of Mozambique's 15 million people in danger of starvation. As many as six million have been displaced from their homes, many of them forced into exile in neighboring countries, with up to one million concentrated in Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task of coordinating assistance for Mozambicans in need -- and the job of day-to-day administration of the government in Maputo -- lies with Prime Minister Mario Machungo. In an interview during this month's African Development Bank meeting in Abidjan, Machungo spoke of the challenges facing his country-at-war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: Are you able to get help to the people left hungry and homeless by the fighting?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: No, people living in some areas are inaccessible. The war has destroyed much of our transport infrastructure, such as roads and bridges.  We don't have planes or money for this effort. That is why the collaboration and aid of the international community is very important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Have your recent appeals for assistance had an adequate response?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: Unfortunately, no. We are still talking with donor countries in order to speed up the flow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Do you have hopes that this round of talks will result in an agreement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: Yes, we always keep our hopes for peace.  Our delegation has instructions from our president to cooperate with Renamo in order to bring Renamo to reasonable thinking and to find peace. Renamo has said they are committed to the peace process. This has been broadcast and published everywhere in the world. We think the democratization process going on in Mozambique and the trends towards peace and detente in the world may influence Renamo to open their minds, to understand that it is now time for peace in our country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environment has been created in Mozambique for Renamo to transform itself into a party, and if they want power that they have to gain power at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Where does Renamo's outside support come from now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: Maybe the same sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: We don't think that the government of South Africa is supporting Renamo, but some forces inside South Africa are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: It is widely reported that Kenya backs Renamo. Has your government discussed this with Kenya?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: Yes, recently President Chissano made an official visit to Kenya and talked with President Moi to strengthen our mutual understanding.  President Moi stressed his commitment to helping Mozambique reach peace and cooperation with all the countries in the region, including Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Does the fact that the central committee of Frelimo voted against the new constitution -- and was then overridden by the political bureau -- suggest that there are deep divisions within Frelimo about the changes taking place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: We have some divergences, but the discussions we have had have been very positive. There is agreement that Frelimo should continue being a party committed to social justice and democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When we took the constitution to the people for discussion (in a series of nationwide seminars and debates), the majority said they wanted the one-party system. But because there was a strata of our population that believe in the multiparty system, we had to take this into account. The majority is not always right. That's why our politburo proposed a multiparty system, because of the need to accommodate minority feelings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: In the economy, where do you see the best possibilities for revitalization and what are your development priorities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungo: After 27 years of war in our country, I must say that peace is our first priority. Life has been completely disrupted, and we have to resettle people and restore normality. Poverty is devastating our people. This means we have to emphasize rural development -- agriculture, as well as health and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The role of the government will be building up the proper environment for the development of private enterprise. This will also provide the important social base for pluralism, for the guarantee of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are also focusing attention of the problems of women and children.  Historically, women have played an important role socially and economically. We have to take this into account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1267 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the Unita movement, are slated to take part in a formal signing ceremony late this month for the peace accord announced at the beginning of May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the agreement, a cease-fire in the 16-year-long war took effect last Wednesday. The accord also calls for the formation of a new national army and for national elections between September and November of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the deadline for cessation in hostilities approached, Savimbi pledged his forces' compliance. But the Luanda government charged that Unita forces were on the offensive in four provinces, seeking to gain control of at least one town before the fighting stopped. In New York, Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro da Castro van Dunem said he has evidence that South Africa is still supplying Unita in violation of a 1988 agreement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The road to settlement in Angola has been long and difficult. The war between Unita rebels and government forces, controlled by dos Santos' ruling MPLA, began prior to the country's independence in 1975. A United Nations estimate says at least 500,000 children died during the 1980s from war and the effects of war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola's impoverished population of nearly 10 million has been uprooted by the fighting. According to the human rights organization Africa Watch, both sides in the conflict have been guilty of &quot;rampant abuse of civilians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace terms call for the cease-fire and election process to be monitored by United Nations observers and overseen by a verification panel composed of the two Angolan warring parties and three foreign governments. The three are Portugal, the former colonial power which mediated the agreement; the Soviet Union, which along with Cuba has been the major source of support for the MPLA; and the United States, which, along with South Africa, has been Unita's largest backer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An end to the fighting could bring a fairly rapid recovery for Angola's economy, which is potentially one of the strongest in Africa. The country produces about 453,000 barrels of oil a day, making an amount second only to Nigeria in sub-Saharan Africa. Oil accounts for one-third of the Gross Domestic Product, half the government revenue, and over 90% of total export earnings. Chevron and several other American oil companies have major operations in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1988, the government has committed itself to an economic reform program designed to attract additional foreign investment and stimulate a local private sector. Heading the list of government priorities are agriculture and agro-processing industries. According to Finance Minister Aguinaldo Jaime, Angola's fertile soil &quot;can grow almost anything.&quot; The missing ingredient has been peace, he said in an interview during this month's annual meeting of the African Development Bank in Abidjan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: The Programa da Saneamento Economico e Financeiro (SEF) was launched nearly three years ago. Why has there not been more progress?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: The results have not been all that encouraging because the on-going war takes about 15% of our revenues. And that is reason enough not to achieve any development, any of the objectives we have set up. On the other hand, I am very encouraged by several recent trends. If we manage to bring the war to an end, we will succeed in developing the country, but if the war proceeds, there is no chance for development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Are you optimistic that the war will end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: I think there is still some uncertainty. If we succeed in creating a national army, then I will be optimistic. To let MPLA and Unita maintain their own armed forces would be a disaster. But the United States and the Soviet Union are playing an important role. Fifteen years of conflict have created so many hard feelings, so much distrust that we need this help to bring the conflict to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: While the war certainly explains some of the shortcomings of SEF, there are some steps which could have been taken but were not. Why not?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: There has been a big debate within the government, within the party, and even within the entire society. Many people fear that because we are just about to begin an election process, this is not the right time to implement some of the measures. They are unpopular, because the distortions in the Angolan economy are so huge and some of the measures in the short run will really affect the standard of living of our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some of us believe there is no valid alternative to moving ahead at this time. The more we delay the implementation of the reforms, the more the distortions continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Devaluation was one of the steps promised in SEF. But when it finally took place in March, it was a rather modest in scope, since there remains a huge gap between the official rate of 59.2 to a U.S. dollar and the unofficial going rate of about 1000 to a dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: We have devalued by 100%, and this is very far from the equilibrium rate of exchange, which lies somewhere between the official rate and the rate on the parallel market. We didn't expect impressive results, but we wanted to see the reaction of the economy. With devaluation, we think we could probably create the conditions to increase our domestic production, and this is not something that is going to happen in just three or four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We believe further devaluations are needed. But the end of the war is more essential. Since the circulation of people and goods are impossible, we cannot stimulate domestic production while there is fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What other measures are planned to deal with the big price gaps that exist between the official stores and the parallel market? Doesn't the continued existence of the parallel market indicate you have a serious problem with corruption?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: The prices in the official market are artificial, meaning there is really a temptation to deviate these products from the official circuit and sell them in the parallel market where you can obtain large amounts of profits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of our targets for this year is to reform our system of pricing and just subsidize one or two or three products. The government continues to believe that a few primary goods must be sold at an artificial price, subsidized by the state -- sugar, powdered milk, bread, flour, perhaps. Prices for all the other products are going to increase. It is not going to be popular. This is a very sensitive moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Will this affect the rest of the country or principally only Luanda?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: No, mainly Luanda. There we don't have any agriculture. In most of the provinces, they are able to produce some, even with the war. Not enough to distribute to the whole population, but sufficient for people living there.  The parallel market is a phenomenon essentially limited to Luanda, where there is a large population of dislocated people -- people have come there because they believe they will be safer. From about 500,000 in colonial times, the capital now has about two million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What are your first priorities for economic development?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaime: In the past, Angola was self-sufficient in food production. We want to end our dependence on imports and promote agriculture and food-processing industries. We also want to attract foreign investment to our mines, (as in) the oil sector. We have fish and fish-processing, as well as other light industrial capacity. And we must build housing for our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If we manage to stabilize the country, Angola can play a major role in the development of southern Africa, of all of Africa.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">770 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) has ruled Guinea-Bissau since its leaders declared unilateral independence in late 1973 -- a move that helped spark the coup six months later, which toppled the Portuguese dictatorship and led to independence for all of Portugal's African colonies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, the PAIGC-controlled national assembly voted to end one-party rule and allow the formation of opposition groups to contest elections slated for 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to President Joao Bernando Viera, who came to power in a 1980 coup, the shift is the continuation of a reform process begun in the early 1980s. The first step was a program of economic liberalization designed to reverse economic decline and make the country eligible for international assistance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitutional changes approved on May 4 allow a new party to register once it receives 2,000 verifiable signatures. Other changes proposed by a constitutional commission set up by Viera include guarantees of press freedoms and trade union rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One opposition party, the Social Democratic Front, led by Rafael Barbosa, has already been established, according to Agence France Presse.  Another group, led by former PAIGC official, Aristides Minerves, is expected to apply for registration soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea-Bissau has a per capita income of only $ 170, and an average life expectancy among the world's lowest -- less than 47 years. The government believes 40% of children under five suffer from malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viera is campaigning for increased outside aid and investment. Last month, he brought his case for help to the First African-African American Summit in Abidjan where Africa News interviewed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN: As a leader of a country making the transition from single party rule to pluralism, how do you explain the rapid pace of democratization now taking place in this part of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viera: With regard to Guinea-Bissau, I must emphasize that we are not copying any other examples. We actually started discussing change at our 1984 party congress. Nobody on the outside paid much attention, except that some of our friends in the eastern bloc started giving us some criticism. We began with economic liberalization and have moved from there. We have not acted under pressure. We are taking these steps because we need to go forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: With all the difficulties you are facing, particularly on the economic front, has the PAIGC lost some of its support?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viera: Not at all. Everybody remembers the leading role the party played in the liberation of the country. In nearly every family, someone supported the liberation struggle and shared the suffering we went through. We look at the PAIGC as the father, who after providing for the children to grow up, must now allow them the freedom to do whatever they wish. We think it is time for new parties to take part in the political life of our country. If tomorrow the PAIGC is not leading the country politically, it will still be remembered for what it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: You have changed policies, moving away from a centrally-planned economy. How has this affected the PAIGC's political priorities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viera: Our objectives and goals are still the same. We still have to fight poverty and hunger and provide better living conditions and education for our population. To tackle those problems, we need means, and that's what we are seeking from developed countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What are your economic priorities?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viera: We now have a totally free market in Guinea-Bissau. In the past, the state was the major economic factor, but this did not work. That's the reason we decided to liberalize. But because of this and because of colonialism, there are no Guineans with capital to play the role we are looking for. We have to provide loans to our citizens in order for them to become real participants in the economic process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to attract tourists, but we have to get people to know our country better -- they confuse us with Guinea (Conakry), Equatorial Guinea, Papua New Guinea. We also need to develop our tourist infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country has the potential for growth in agriculture, mining, and forestry. Fisheries could also be very important, but we do not have the means to control our waters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pirate fishing is a big problem for us. We have introduced new laws to try to protect our fish, especially certain species, and to preserve our other wildlife and the environment. As a measure of the importance we attach to this, I am chairing a national commission on the protection of our wildlife and environment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, multiparty elections in two island nations off Africa's west coast ousted leaders who had governed since independence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miguel Trovoada was elected president of Sao Tome and Pr?ncipe, replacing Manuel Pinto da Costa, who dropped out of the race a month before the voting. Trovoada, 54, was one of the leaders of the independence struggle and served as prime minister under Pinto da Costa until 1979, when he was charged with plotting a coup, sent to jail for two years, and then exiled to Paris.</SPAN></P>

Voted out was 67-year-old Aristides Pereira, leader of the African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde (PAIGV), which have spearheaded the anti-colonial campaign.  The years in power had eroded the PAIGV's popularity, and the party also lost the parliamentary elections, winning 23 seats compared with 56 captured by the Movement for Democracy, headed by Carlos Veiga, who has become the country's new prime minister.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national census scheduled for next October in Nigeria will provide the first count of Nigerians since 1973.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To prepare for the massive project and identify weaknesses in the logistical preparations, the Nigerian National Population Commission conducted a trial census during three days in mid-March. Commission officials said the exercise uncovered a number of flaws, including a shortage of census materials, the inability of enumerators to cover their assigned territories, and widespread misunderstanding of the questions on the census forms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With its current estimated population of 116 million, Nigeria already counts itself home to one of every four Africans. In addition to trying to pin down a more precise population figure, the census is expected to provide essential social and economic data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one statistic the census will not be able to provide is the number of Nigerians who practice various faiths. The October exercise will omit any question about religion -- perhaps the most sensitive and divisive issue the country faces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growth of Islamic fundamentalism in the northern region, where large numbers of young people have been joining militant Shi'ite groups, has contributed to the worst religious conflict in Nigeria since the early 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest clashes, in which several hundred people have died and dozens of churches have been burned, have followed months of simmering conflict between Muslims and Christians in the area. Islamic fundamentalist leaders have demanded that the government allow the practice of Sharia, a strict legal code mandating such penalties as stoning and dismemberment, that is rejected by many Muslims as well as other groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Anthony Okogie, says the country risks a religious war unless the government can protect Christians from what he called &quot;fanatical Muslims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, himself a Muslim, warned on state radio that the government will deal &quot;very ruthlessly&quot; with religious violence. &quot;Why should people impose their wishes, beliefs or ideologies on others?&quot; Babangida asked, saying that Islam opposes the spread of the faith by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month the Nigerian Vice President, Admiral Augustus Aikhomu, a Christian, visited Bauchi state, where mosques as well as dozens of churches have been destroyed by rival groups. Aikhomu said extremist Christian evangelicals bear some of the blame for the religious tensions. But in a stern speech, he also said that radical Shi'ites must recognize Nigeria as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, whose government will respond forcefully to intolerence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week an evangelical church leader charged that Christians are still being killed in northern areas, often in quiet raids on people in their homes or fields. People will begin going hungry, he warned, because fear is keeping them away from their farm work.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS -- As Africa's most populous nation makes its third attempt since independence to establish a durable democracy, the question of how to insure a free and fair voting process has become a central issue for the military government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the decision by Nigeria's Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) to conduct elections by what is commonly known as the &quot;open ballot,&quot; President Ibrahim Babangida said the AFRC based its choice on Nigeria's &quot;historical experience&quot; and its present level of socio-political development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Open balloting had a trial run last December during local government elections, when voters lined up in front of posters of competing candidates. At a signal from polling officials, voters would raise their hands in acknowledgment while counting off, &quot;One,&quot; &quot;Two,&quot; &quot;Three,&quot; and so on down each line. Election monitors walked down the lines to confirm the count.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was one of Nigeria's most successful elections, unmarred by the incidents of violence and charges of electoral fraud that were a common feature of past polls. Most politicians as well the country's lively press expressed confidence in the results. The slightly left-of-center Social Democratic Party emerged with a slim lead over the slightly right-of-center National Republican convention by capturing 2,934 local council seats to its rival's 2,558.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics of open balloting say it has a major flaw that was apparent in the December elections, when a reluctance to make their choices public kept most voters from the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Liberties Organization, a leading human rights group, has filed a court action to have the local council elections nullified. Olisa Agbakoba, the group's president, says the low participation prevented the voting from being free and fair. Turn-out is estimated to have been as low as 10%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics also say that the system of lining up is primitive and unwieldy. They say that voters who stay away either out of fear or because the procedures are cumbersome have been effectively disenfranchised. Ray Ekpu, editor of the weekly newsmagazine Newswatch, acknowledges that the secret ballot system must be modified to allow more effective management, but he argues that secret balloting &quot;drastically reduces undue influence on the voter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates of open voting counter that avoiding the mistakes of past elections requires public scrutiny of the process. The four major elections in the country's history -- in 1959, 1964, 1979 and 1983 -- employed secret ballots, but the results were tarnished by large-scale malpractices. Among the techniques that became commonplace were the printing of fake ballots and the stuffing of ballot boxes by corrupt elections officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the resulting rancor over disputed results that provided the Nigerian military with excuses to overthrow elected governments in 1966 and 1983.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our problems in the past have been with secret ballots and the ballot papers,&quot; Babangida said, defending the ruling council decision, &quot;and we want to make sure that this problem does not persist in our national life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Nigerians agree that open balloting is preferable to fraudulent or disputed elections -- and more democratic as well. &quot;Who defines democracy?&quot; says Shola Adedipe, a political science major at the University of Lagos. &quot;We don't have to continue adopting foreign electoral models if those models have proved unworkable here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis Obi, editor of the news magazine African Concord, says nobody &quot;has handled Nigeria's secret balloting and was not worsted in the enterprise.  The open ballot is crude, but it is cash and carry, it is in broad daylight, there are no tricks, no mysteries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid the din generated by the arguments on both sides, the National Electoral Commission, the body charged with overseeing the election process, organized a conference of opinion leaders to examine the ballot question. Virtually all participants, including two former electoral commission chairmen who administered secret ballot elections, favored open voting over the use of ballot papers -- a fact the ruling council must have taken into account when it made its decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a paper presented at the conference, Social Democratic Party head Babagana Kingibe said Nigeria is not politically mature enough for a secret ballot system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political pundits, among them National Republican Convention leader Tom Ikimi, suggested an &quot;open-secret&quot; ballot, in which the marking of ballots could be done in secret, while both the depositing of ballots in boxes and the counting and registering of votes would take place publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there was general agreement that fine tuning is needed to increase voter turn-out and reduce other flaws of the open system, there was also acknowledgment that what is called &quot;the Nigerian factor&quot; -- a chronic tendency to rig elections -- makes it easier for the government to win support for any system that seems capable of deterring fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If ballot papers are introduced,&quot; says Dozie Odunze, a Lagos lawyer, &quot;be sure that fake ones will be printed by politicians.&quot; Odunze appears to reflect widespread public opinion when he says that secret ballots in Nigeria result in a lack of confidence in the results and a question mark on the elected government's legitimacy. And that, he argues, is a sure recipe for further military coups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians don't appear to share the suspicions of voter line-ups that are prevalant in many African countries, such as Kenya, where public voting is widely seen as a government attempt to intimidate its opponents. In Nigeria, even critics of the government credit President Babangida with a bold attempt to forge a genuine democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(For four years, the military government Babangida heads has been orchestrating a gradual return to civilian structures. Among the multifaceted preparations are a national census scheduled for October, and the creation last year of two parties from among more than 60 that competed for recognition.  Public reaction then was similar to the current response to open voting: the hope that the measure might free party politics from the corruption of the past appeared to outweigh the unease over the establishment of parties by military fiat.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transition to democracy is due to culminate in the election of governors and state legislators for Nigeria's 21 states late this year, followed by voting for federal legislators and a civilian president in 1992.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS -- Deft diplomatic footwork, designed to install an African as the next secretary-general of the United Nations is extending from this city to important capitals around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second five-year term of the incumbent, Javier Perez de Cuellar of Peru, expires at the end of the year, and there is no shortage of African candidates to take his place.  Among those who have been considered by ad hoc search committees are Joseph Garba of Nigeria, former president of the UN General Assembly; Ghanaian Kenneth Dadzie, secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development; Bernard Chidzero, Zimbabwe's finance minister; Senegalese president Abdou Diouf; Tanzania's Salim Ahmed Salim, the current secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU); James Jonah, the Sierra Leonean undersecretary-general of the UN; and Olara Otunnu, Uganda's former foreign minister who now heads the International Peace Academy in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For now, the top African contender appears to be retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Nigerian head of state who has won the endorsement of Nigeria's government. Although the decision to back Obasanjo has not yet been announced publicly, the government of President Ibrahim Babangida has already begun an international lobbying campaign on his behalf. Nigeria hopes to persuade African heads of state attending the Organization of African Unity summit, due to convene in Abuja, Nigeria in early June, to unanimously accept Obasanjo as &quot;Africa's candidate&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the UN Charter does not require a geographical rotation of the secretary-general's position, many believe Africa is due for a turn at running the world body. The past five UN chiefs have come from Europe, Asia and Latin America. Africa with the largest group of member countries has never produced a secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we miss this time,&quot; says Ibrahim Gambari, Nigeria's ambassador to the UN, &quot;Africa will not have another opportunity this century to fight for the UN post.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perez de Cuellar has said he would prefer an African to succeed him.  If the five permanent members of the Security Council refuse to agree to an African, Perez argues, &quot;Africa must feel excluded.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is Africa vying for what Trygve Lie, the first UN secretary-general, called &quot;the most impossible job on earth,&quot; when its citizens are struggling daily against poverty and war? The reasons, analysts here say, include a belief that an African secretary-general can make a success of global assignments and, in the process, raise the continent's international profile and help shatter racist myths of black inferiority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabriel Olusanya, former head of Nigeria's Institute of International Affairs, says that although the position has been traditionally administrative and not a strong decision-making one, &quot;an African secretary-general can influence decisions where Africa is unfairly treated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others believe that holding such a powerfully symbolic international position will give the continent greater confidence to push its diplomatic and economic interests. Getting greater international cooperation for solutions to Africa's economic crisis is one of those aims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another, according to diplomats here, is a permanent seat for Africa on the Security Council. &quot;A continent that accounts for roughly a third of the UN's membership ought to be represented in the most powerful chamber on a permanent basis,&quot; Gambari argues. Germany and Japan are also seeking permanent seats in the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the wane of the cold war and with the UN's image enhanced following the Gulf crisis, and after such successes as supervising Namibia's independence process, there is a pervasive feeling that strong leadership could help the UN fulfill its original mission of maintaining world order. Africa's trumpet blowers say the continent has many leaders of international stature on whom that cap would fit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With these goals heading Africa's agenda, Olusegun Obasanjo is hardly a surprise choice.  A military general who voluntarily handed over power to a democratically elected government, the widely admired leader has chalked up an impressive international resume since leaving office in 1979. He has served on numerous international commissions on security and development issues. In 1988 he founded the Africa Leadership Forum, a respected think tank that trains future African leaders and proposes strategies for the continent's development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jonathan Power of the Baltimore Sun wrote that Obasanjo &quot;is a civil libertarian, a man of enormous courage and resolve and has no time for people or countries that put principles of international law on one side whenever it becomes convenient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the long run, much is riding on the decision of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. A veto by one of the five will defeat any candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1981 Tanzania's Salim, a popular choice of many UN members, was a candidate for the secretary-generalship against the incumbent, Kurt Waldheim of Austria, who was seeking an unprecedented third term. Salim lost, due to a United States veto. China then vetoed Waldheim, leading to the emergence of Perez de Cuellar, a dark horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many diplomats here believe it is unlikely that the Bush White House will follow Ronald Reagan's 1981 example and veto an African front-runner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the first woman and the first black to head the 37-year-old African-American Institute (AAI) in New York, Vivian Lowery Derryck would seem to have fulfilled the promise of the generation that rose to prominence in the wake of the civil rights struggle. But she hasn't yet found any laurels upon which to rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a blunt, impassioned speech to the final Summit plenary, Derryck told African Americans that they had not done enough for Africa, and she appealed for a new commitment to building a constituency for Africa in the United States. She described a Ford Foundation-funded project to create a network of advocates for Africa in six U.S. cities as one of AAI's most important programs -- one that should be allied with similar efforts across the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a catalogue of Africa's needs, Derryck talked about universities without textbooks, about population growth that outstrips food production, and about the loss of an African tree species every day. And she called for new thinking on the continent's debt crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of those issues deserve more attention, Derryck said, and she had intended to talk about them in her speech. &quot;I was going to emphasize the need to help rebuild one proud institution of higher education like Makerere University in Uganda,&quot; she said, &quot;which has never recovered from the (rule of Idi) Amin.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the end, Derryck said, she decided to focus her talk on an issue where conference participants could make an immediate and measurable impact -- the war &quot;right next door&quot; in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberia is a child of the United States,&quot; Derryck said, reminding delegates of Liberia's founding by former slaves, its capital named for U.S.  President James Monroe, its legal system codified by Cornell University Law School and its red, white and blue flag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia's immediate neighbors have been &quot;incredibly generous,&quot; Derryck said, providing sanctuary, food and medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said Liberia and the region need greater assistance to cope with the highest percentage of refugees of any country in the world, with the possible exception of the Persian Gulf countries where reliable figures are still unavailable. As many as half of Liberia's two million people are thought to be displaced from their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The good news, Derryck said, is that &quot;a special optimism abounds in Liberia&quot; that has prompted ordinary people to organize self-help projects, food brigades and relief efforts. But peace, she said, &quot;is desperately needed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States could help more, Derryck said, both with material aid and with the attempt by the Economic Community of West African States to bring an end to the fighting. She said she is haunted by a question posed to her during the Summit by a Liberian friend: &quot;Why have black Americans let us down?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a plea to each of you,&quot; Derryck told her audience, &quot;to become knowledgeable and politically literate about this issue. The civil rights giants here with us today fought not only so that we could vote, but so that we could influence policy through our informed positions on issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Derryck resumed her seat, it was evident that she had touched a chord in her listeners. With the plenary continuing around them, a parade of delegates knelt by her side, asking for more information or copies of her remarks, and promising their help for future efforts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Official African and U.S. delegates to the African-African American Summit issued a declaration at the meeting's close, pledging to create an Implementation Committee to act as a follow-up mechanism to the conference.  Here are excerpts from the declaration of intent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We have assembled: to reestablish the bond of togetherness that has not existed since Africans were uprooted and relocated to the Americas and other parts of the world several centuries ago, and to find ways to accelerate the development process of Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * African Americans reaffirm their commitment, not only to apply their personal expertise and resources to assist in this development effort, but also to network with others in an effort to acquire significant aid to help accelerate the social and economic growth and development of African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We have noted with concern, on the one hand the continued plummeting of the export prices of Africa's commodities and the skyrocketing of the prices of imported manufactured goods, and on the other hand the ever-growing burden of external debt and the attendant reverse flow of resources that keep widening the gap between Africa and other parts of the world. In this context, we call for adequately remunerative prices for African raw materials, as well as the total relief and cancellation of all official debt, and we support the expansion of efforts to eliminate all commercial debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We subscribe to the proposition that Africans, African Americans and other friends of Africa shall collaborate in the creation of a climate that shall encourage investment, trade and industrialization, resulting in higher value added (to Africa's primary products) through joint ventures by American corporations and small and medium size African American entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In accordance with this concept, African governments shall continue to evaluate their policies and, where necessary, amend them so that American corporations and companies will be encouraged to increase their investments in Africa. The American investors shall make provisions for equality in employment practices for all workers (and) adhere to environmental standards designed to protect natural beauty and resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We consider the strengthening of regional integration to be a priority at both the governmental and non-governmental levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We call for and encourage the participation of African American educators and others in educational and technical programs that will help prepare our populations to be competitive in the twenty-first century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We urge better understanding and appreciation of the African heritage and the infusion of the past and present contributions of Africa into all American schools, colleges and universities, and into churches, mosques and other places of worship as well as into the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We recognize that the sufficient production of food and the protection and preservation of the environment are key to the survival of Africa. We pledge to work for the improvement of international trade and exchange policies to encourage farming and strengthen Africa's agricultural infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We commend the American government for increasing its economic assistance to Africa. However, we regret that sub-Saharan Africa is still receiving a disproportionately small amount of assistance in comparison with some other parts of the world. We urge all African Americans and other friends of Africa to use their energy, clout and resources to lobby the American government for a substantial increase in aid to sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We have decided that the following commissions should be established:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> % Commission on Economic Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Commission on History and Culture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Commission on Education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Commission on Agriculture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Commission on Health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summit organizers said the work of the commissions would be coordinated by a high-level steering committee and promised further conferences at two-year intervals in the future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN -- Folks who had hoped to eat local foods were fed champagne and raspberries flown in from France. Wanting to see how ordinary Africans lived, delegates were entertained in the marbled halls of a presidential palace and slept in the plush opulence of a grand hotel that boasts a casino, a bowling alley and an ice skating rink. Speeches and declarations ruled the agenda, rather than the anticipated discussions and interactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the end, those complaints paled beside the reality of being in Africa and the conviction that, though this might be a first trip for some, it certainly wouldn't be the last. Links were forged, promises were made, and plans were changed, sometimes dramatically.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mark Fields, a physician from Rocky Mount, North Carolina, decided to leave his medical practice to spend time working on rural health care somewhere in Africa. Several people pooled their resources to assist Liberian refugees they had met on the street.  Representatives of African American women's organizations met with a group of African women, and pledged to work together on specific small-scale development projects in African villages. &quot;This is the sort of thing our chapters are doing already, but we want to do more,&quot; said Freddye Prophet, director of international services for the Links. &quot;Our members like to see that their help makes a difference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of students from U.S. colleges spent part of their time conferring with each other, in what they said would be the beginnings of a student network to tackle African issues. &quot;I really wanted to get out of this hotel and meet Africans,&quot; said Rahmanda Campbell, president of the student government at Delaware State College. &quot;But I think that what we do after we leave here can really be important.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To those most knowledgeable about current events in the region, there was a sense of irony that the Summit took little note of the political revolutions taking place all around it.  In the weeks before the conference, pro-democracy campaigns forced concessions from authoritarian rulers in several nearby countries, and more than one head of state expected to attend the Summit was thrown out of office before he could arrive. &quot;These people are true heroes,&quot; mused one journalist, gazing around a room that held Benjamin Hooks of the NAACP, Dorothy Height of the National Council of Negro Women, Joseph Lowery of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Coretta Scott King of the Martin Luther King Center. &quot;They've spent their lives fighting for justice. How can they ignore Africans struggling for the same thing?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some Summit participants said they were confident that increased awareness would lead to greater support for democratic movements across Africa. &quot;African affairs is the new frontier for African Americans,&quot; said Don Anderson, publisher of Emerge magazine. &quot;This is the first step in a process that will develop over the next twenty years.&quot; Once African Americans understand the issues they will respond, Anderson said, &quot;whether it's South Africa, West Africa or any other part of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entertainer-activist Dick Gregory said he hoped the conference would prompt a reevaluation by African Americans of their own choices. Gregory sees a direct link between the health and well-being of Africans and that of Africa's descendents in the U.S., where a measure of material achievement has led, he believes, to the threat of spiritual poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got to rearrange priorities,&quot; he said. &quot;We as black folks that put on a $ 300 suit and $30,000 worth of jewelry and get in a $27,000 car and drive to a black church and give $ 5 -- we've got to change. We've got to breathlife into our black institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The notion that a renewed sense of purpose among black Americans will have beneficial effects on both sides of the Atlantic divide was common at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that African Americans can help mobilize resources for African development, said Sheila Walker, director of the Center for African and African American studies at the University of Texas, and a member of the committee that planned the Summit. What Americans can gain from the partnership may be less obvious, she said, but is no less real. The restoration of ruptured ties with Africa, Walker said, can help replace the negative self-image of &quot;a population that sees its origins in defeat and oppression.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very real differences between Africans and African Americans &quot;impede our mutual understanding,&quot; said Moumouni Djermakoye, Niger's ambassador to the United States, who headed the planning committee. But he said many on both continents, especially young people, &quot;are expressing a symbolic identification with each other in a variety of ways.&quot; The Summit, he said, had given those symbols more substance and dynamism, and provided a foundation &quot;for combined activities based on our common interests and for our mutual good.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a cultural evening that went on into the morning hours, two of contemporary America's cultural icons gave a performance that illustrated both the continuing continental divide and the possibilities for bridging it. When Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee approached the microphones, a group of Ivorian women at a table in the back of the room continued to talk among themselves, as they had all night. &quot;I can't understand a word,&quot; said one -- a common frustration among French-speaking African participants. Although major speeches at the plenaries were translated, English predominated sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the U.S. film stars began reading African poetry in French, and the table suddenly quieted. &quot;Ahhhh,&quot; said one of the Ivorians, in a long sigh of satisfaction, as two children of Africa who had made it in the new world showed that they knew how to connect with the old one as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN -- The first African-African American Summit was one man's dream, and many people thought, up until the last moment, that he couldn't pull it off.  Funding was uncertain, confirmations of participation were slow to come in, and logistical problems threatened to swamp the organizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when the Reverend Leon H. Sullivan stood onstage in the Hotel Ivoire, hands upraised and face streaming with tears, leading a chorus of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; to the cheers of hundreds of delegates, few doubted that his vision had power. If some of the African participants, raised in more formal cultures than their American cousins, were not wholly at ease with all the fervor, they were ready, nevertheless, to welcome the intent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If black Americans can organize around an issue like debt relief,&quot; said Tanzania's deputy foreign minister Abdou Kinana, &quot;it could be of immense benefit to Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occasion was a late-April meeting in Cote d'Ivoire's cosmopolitan capital that drew over 500 Americans as well as five African presidents, one vice-president, and numerous cabinet officials from around the continent. The Summit was conceived by Sullivan, a 68-year-old Baptist minister and businessman who founded a Philadelphia-based job training program in 1964 and recently established a foundation to encourage corporate and institutional involvement in development projects, primarily in Africa. In Africanist circles, he is perhaps best known for his &quot;Sullivan Principles,&quot; a 1977 code of conduct for U.S. companies operating in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa is the forgotten continent,&quot; Sullivan said in an interview. He said a broad, national campaign by African Americans and other friends of Africa offers the only prospect for putting Africa on the U.S. foreign policy agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. Payne Lucas, the president of Africare, a Washington, D.C.-based development agency, came to Abidjan because he agrees with that assessment.  &quot;Africa's future,&quot; he said, &quot;is tied to building a strong African American constituency at home. This conference represents an opportunity to help fashion that new constituency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the focus of the three-day meeting often seemed diffuse, the final sessions offered the prospect that the results could be concrete. A delegation of Congressional representatives, led by House majority whip William H. Gray III (D-PA), pledged to work for an additional $ 200 million in development assistance for Africa in the 1992 budget. In a speech to the conference, Gray also stressed a theme that had been largely absent from the public discussions -- the widespread African movement for greater democracy and human rights. &quot;Human rights must be in the forefront of our relationship,&quot; Gray said, &quot;and this principle must apply to all of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African diplomats at the conference seemed to have a mixture of hope and skepticism about the outcome as they interacted with delegates, many of whom were on their first visit to Africa. Some Africans noted that the attempt to build a voice for Africa in the U.S. is already being pursued by groups like the African American lobby TransAfrica, and that the effort requires a persistent and patient commitment more than an emotional catharsis. But many said any new recruits to the cause of raising Africa's profile are urgently needed, at a time when the continent is feeling increasingly bypassed in world affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A major goal of this meeting,&quot; said Summit planning committee member Sheila Walker, from the University of Texas at Austin, &quot;is to involve African Americans on a much larger and more institutionalized scale than ever before in the economic and social development of Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan told the conference, in a rousing final speech, that 35 million black Americans pay $ 70 billion a year in taxes, and that their purchasing power gives them further clout. International companies that don't pay fair prices for Africa's commodities, he warned, may find their own products left on the shelves when blacks spend their money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promising follow-up through a series of meetings and commissions, including a campaign to be taken to churches across the United States this fall, Sullivan said African Americans possess the power to force the government to help Africa deal with its debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans attending the meeting seemed in broad agreement that if the push to cancel the debt becomes a reality, the Summit could become the historically important event in African development that Sullivan imagined when he planned it. Even a lively public discussion of the issue in the U.S., said one, could aid Africa's campaign for some form of debt relief that will enable its economies to escape what Sullivan called the &quot;millstone&quot; around African necks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Africa's total debt is smaller than that of Latin America or Asia, and often gets slight attention in international discussions on the third world debt crisis, Africa carries a heavier debt burden in relation to the size of its economies. Latin America's debt, for example, is 60% of its gross domestic product, whereas the percentage for sub-Saharan Africa is over 100%.  Only Africa, among all the world's regions, is expected to grow poorer during this decade, a prospect largely attributable to the weight of its debt. African diplomats and economists are united in the view that a lifting of the debt burden could dramatically transform Africa's prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But &quot;unless African Americans are truly organized,&quot; says Africare's C.  Payne Lucas, &quot;there's little hope that Africa is going to get its share of American foreign policy interest and bilateral aid.&quot; On the other hand, he says, African Americans in an alliance with white Americans who care about the continent can create small miracles. The Africare chapter in Chicago alone, he says, has already raised $ 50,000 for child survival in Burkina Faso. And the NAACP, with 600,000 members, is asking every chapter to plant trees in Africa, where deforestation is among the most pressing environmental problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a magic moment for Africa,&quot; Lucas says, &quot;and Americans can help insure that the magic materializes.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Development Bank (ADB), created in 1963, provides loans to its African members to support economic and social development. To keep pace with inflation, the bank's management this year proposed a slight rise in lending but encountered opposition from the major industrial powers, who want to set stricter conditions on the terms of the loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ADB, with assets of nearly $ 9 billion, is the smallest of the four established multilateral lending institutions, which include the Asian and Inter-American Development Banks and the World Bank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ADB is the most profitable. Financial figures presented at this year's annual meeting in Abidjan show that the bank's net income increased by nearly 25% over the past five years, compared with 15 percent for the Asian Bank, the next most profitable of the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the ADB's net transfer of resources to Africa over the last year -- $ 1.2 billion -- was larger than that of any multilateral financial institution operating on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the addition of Namibia this year, the ADB has 51 African, or Tregional' members. Turkey became the 26th Tnon-regional' member. African countries account for 65% of the capital and have two-thirds of the votes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Management's proposal to increase lending to about 1.6 billion Units of Account (UA), about $ 1.8 billion, was criticized as too ambitious.  Management similarly sought a small increase for the African Development Fund, the affiliated institution which makes interest-free loans to the continent's poorer nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the donor countries balked at any increase, citing budgetary pressures and the need for sound financial management. Leading the charge for lower outlays was Walter McClean of Canada, who said the proposed rise &quot;goes beyond the internal prudential guidelines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a contentious debate by the board of directors and pointed remarks in many of the formal speeches, Austria put forward a compromise, which limited lending this year to between 1.4 and 1.6 billion UA and avoided a showdown along geographic lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, the Africans were clearly disappointed. &quot;The development needs of Africa are so great that we would like to see the bank's loan capacity expand to help meet some of these needs,&quot; said Angolan Finance Minister Aguilnaldo Jaime, current chairman of the bank's Board of Governors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond the drama of the bank's lending size, most members seemed supportive of the policy direction charted by President Babacar N'diaye and his colleagues. Matthew Hennesey, the U.S. governor, spoke of N'diaye's &quot;distinguished record of accomplishment&quot; and specifically endorsed the bank's push for strengthened policies to protect the environment and to increase the role of women, both in formulating development policies and in benefiting from their implementation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN -- Although news out of Africa is dominated by disasters, wars, and human suffering, the head of Africa's preeminent financial institution believes &quot;there is every reason to be positive and optimistic&quot; about the future. Babacar N'diaye, president of the African Development Bank (ADB), says the growing strength of Africa's pro-democracy movement is part of a trend towards accountable, effective government that could reverse the continent's economic decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N'diaye's view, expressed in an interview following this month's annual meeting of the bank, is bolstered by news that the world's poorest continent may have begun a fragile economic revival. The bank's newly released African Development Report 1991 says average per capita income rose last year, following a decade in which living standards across Africa dropped by 25%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa experienced a continent-wide growth rate of 3.6% in 1990, outpacing population growth -- three percent for the year -- for the first time since 1985. Only five countries experienced negative growth rates, down from 10 in 1989 and 14 the previous year, the ADB says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the modest improvement &quot;cannot be considered adequate,&quot; N'diaye said in his speech to the annual meeting.  The current rate of growth, projected at 3 - 3.5% for 1991, is &quot;insufficient&quot; to restore living standards to the level they were at the beginning of the 1980s, the bank says in its latest annual report. &quot;Significant and sustained efforts still have to be made to regain the income losses of the last decade,&quot; the report states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank estimates that Africa must maintain a growth rate in excess of four percent to begin sustained economic resurgence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to N'Diaye, the continued burden of Africa's $ 255 billion debt is &quot;severely thwarting the prospects for recovery and growth.&quot; Payments on principle and interest now take up about 30% of Africa's total export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N'Diaye said &quot;technical solutions alone&quot; will not take care of the problem. The &quot;unsettled -- and unsettling -- question&quot; is whether the international community will &quot;address the problems of indebtedness in a comprehensive and lasting way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 30 African countries are now in the midst of &quot;structural reform programs.&quot; The reforms, usually undertaken under the auspices of the Washington, D.C.-based International Monetary Fund (IMF), are designed to institute sound management techniques and rebuild a country's international credit rating. The measures generally include reductions in government spending, an end to price subsidies on basic consumer goods, and an emphasis on developing the private sector and generating revenues to repay foreign debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Financial experts disagree on whether structural reforms have stimulated the slight economic upturn or have only coincided with it in some countries. The importance the IMF and its colleague institution, the World Bank, attach to expanding the output of cash crops and minerals that earn foreign exchange has come to seem like a bad joke to countries like Cote d'Ivoire and its neighbor, Ghana. Urged to expand production of cocoa and coffee, only to find that Asian and Latin American countries were following the same advice and saturating the market, Africa's commodity producers have watched prices plummet to a 14-year low. As long as these prices stay depressed, the African Development Bank's report acknowledges in an understated analysis, &quot;the prospects for robust export-led growth will remain quite limited.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems associated with the reform programs are not only economic. In Cote d'Ivoire, where the bank is headquartered, the political impact of adjustment has been visible. A year ago, after three decades of near-tranquil independence, the country erupted as large sectors of the population joined in protest marches demanding changes in economic policies and an end to one-party monopoly on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is no coincidence that the agitation for multi-party government&quot; has been most vigorous in the richer countries, says a recent Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) study on West Africa. &quot;The fall in living standards in Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire and Gabon since the mid-1980s has been meteoric.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the commodity slump has hit English-speaking countries like Ghana as well, the EIU report says differing governmental structures help explain &quot;why the multiparty time bomb exploded first within the franc zone.&quot; Former French colonies have established the kind of large civil services found in Paris, and these are the groups whose salaries and jobs have been most affected by the cutbacks of structural adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cote d'Ivoire President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest-serving leader, has managed to diffuse the tensions, though they pose the most serious challenge to his 30 years in power. On the political front, he acceded to the demands for pluralism, and legalized opposition parties and allowed an independent press to flourish. Last November the countrys had its first multiparty elections, which Houphouet-Boigny and the ruling Democratic Party won easily . Today, there are 40 registered parties in the country and nearly two dozen newspapers, where just over a year ago there was a single party and no media diversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To tackle the economy, Houphouet-Boigny turned to a respected banker, Allasane Ouattara, who was governor of the Banque Centrale des ?tats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest, the central bank for the franc-zone nations of West Africa. After serving for several months as &quot;economic czar,&quot; Ouattara was named prime minister last November. Since then he has sounded almost like an opposition leader himself, declaring war on official waste, corruption, and mismanagement. His slashes in government departments and budgets have proved popular with international financial institutions and have won the release of $ 950 million in funds from foreign donors to help ease the economic crunch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a special ruling party congress last month, Ouattara emerged clearly as number two behind the president, even though the heir apparent to the aging leader is the leader of the national assembly, Henri Konan Bedie, who is constitutionally designated to serve out any unfulfilled presidential term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Encouraged by Houphouet-Boigny's example, a number of beleaguered autocrats in other countries have tapped respected figures with impressive financial resumes to assume prime ministerial responsibilities. Gabonese President Omar Bongo chose Ouattara's former counterpart at central's Africa's franc-zone central bank, Oyeba Cassimir. The leaders of the military coup in Mali, after ousting President Moussa Traore in March, named Souman Sacko, who was a senior official in the United Nations Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presidents of Senegal, the Congo, Cameroon and Zaire have all named internationally-known figures to step in amid domestic difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call these guys &quot;techno-politicians -- I hate the term Ttechnocrat',&quot; says the African Development Bank's N'diaye. &quot;Their first expertise is technical and financial, but they have to be political as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the group who made the transition into politics is the new president of Benin, Nicephore Soglo, a former World Bank official, who defeated 11-year dictator Mathieu Kerekou. Named prime minister last year by President Kerekou, who yielded to popular demands for an end to single-party control, Soglo based his winning presidential campaign on his success as manager of the government's economic turn-around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite current trends, however, not everyone in Africa has joined the multiparty bandwagon. At the African Development Bank meeting, Kenya's representative, M. B. Keah, credited the &quot;rapid growth of the Kenyan economy&quot; to the leadership of President Daniel arap Moi, who stubbornly clings to a single-party model for his country. &quot;We are not prepared to accept imposed foreign ideologies,&quot; Keah said, &quot;particularly the standard textbook prescriptions of a multiparty system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other countries are finding that democracy and economic growth do not always co-habit comfortably. According to Angolan Finance Minister, Aguinaldo Jaime, some of his associate in the government, fearing a loss of votes in the country's first multiparty elections next year, are resisting implementation of economic reforms which he himself believes are essential. &quot;These measures are unpopular, and they can be exploited by the opposition,&quot; he conceded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADB officials believe that the solution lies partially in cushioning the effects of structural adjustment with programs that deliver basic services to the poorest segments of the population. Bank president N'diaye said the budget cuts mandated by reform process shouldn't come primarily from social programs. He called for a reduction in the continent's military expenditures, which average twice the outlay on education and are triple the spending on health, and for an end to the dozens of armed conflicts that affect a third of Africa's 54 countries with &quot;varying degrees of severity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank's development report suggests a ratio of spending to Gross Domestic Product of three percent for education and two percent for primary health care.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia has new hopes of gaining the port of Walvis Bay following recent talks with South Africa, says Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab. When Namibia became independent 15 months ago, South Africa retained ownership of Walvis Bay -- the territory's only seaport -- on the grounds that the city was not a part of the old German colony of South West Africa, which South Africa took over after World War I.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Gurirab, South Africa's new attitude was demonstrated during last month's discussions when South African Foreign Minister Roelof Pik' Botha unexpectedly announced his government's redrawing of the two countries' boundary along the Orange River from the Namibian side of the waterway to the middle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha also indicated that Namibia's claim to Walvis Bay, is getting sympathetic consideration in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to an earlier suggestion that resolution of the issue might have to await the outcome of power-sharing talks in South Africa, Namibia solicited endorsements of its claim from the various South African political groupings. Only Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha movement turned down the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally, Pretoria had signaled that flexibility on Walvis Bay would depend on its next-door neighbor's willingness to distance itself from the African National Congress. But after President F.W. de Klerk unbanned the ANC and opened talks with Nelson Mandela, that issue dropped off the negotiating agenda. Last week, ANC President Oliver Tambo paid an official visit to Namibia -- his first. He was warmly welcomed by Namibian President Sam Nujoma, in recognition of the longstanding close ties between the ANC and Nujoma's South West African People's Organization (Swapo).</SPAN></P>

And after all the years of war, the area's future may be decided in little more than 18 weeks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morocco, which claims the former Spanish colony as a province, has agreed to abide by the results of the proposed ballot. Polisario has long pressed for a UN-supervised vote to determine the territory's future, but the group made concessions to secure Morocco's approval. Most importantly, Polisario dropped its demand that the Moroccan authorities in Western Sahara be replaced by a neutral UN administration to oversee elections. Morocco also won the right to leave 65,000 troops in the territory during the vote, although UN forces will monitor the Moroccan presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The referendum is due to take place 20 weeks after a formal cease-fire, which is expected soon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifteen years ago this month, the west African nation of Cameroon declared a day of national mourning to mark the vote by the northern section of the former &quot;British Cameroons&quot; to join Nigeria. The southern section opted to join the former &quot;French Cameroons&quot; as part of the independent Cameroon Republic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the matter hasn't ended there. Local Nigerian government officials responsible for islands off the Atlantic Coast have appealed to the Nigerian federal government to deal with what the islanders say is the occupation of nine fishing settlements by Cameroonian gendarmes. The Nigerian News Agency, which sent a team to investigate the story, says its reporters were blocked in their attempts to visit the islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been public speculation that the matter of a few off-shore villages is not a priority for the Nigerian government, but there are beginning to be calls for authorities in Lagos to respond. &quot;If the federal government has ceded that territory to Cameroon by a gentleman's agreement,&quot; says Nigeria's Tribune newspaper, &quot;it should inform the estimated 32,000 persons under Cameroon occupation of that fact.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A high court decision in Botswana is being hailed as a sweeping victory for women's equality, but Botswana's attorney general says the case has thrown the country into a constitutional crisis. The suit was brought by an attorney, who challenged the law that prevented her two youngest children from being Botswana citizens, even though they were born in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer is married to an American, and the Citizenship Act says children must have the nationality of their father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides in the court battle agree that the case has implications far beyond the citizenship issue. The judge determined that the children had a right to Botswana citizenship, saying that &quot;fundamental liberties&quot; in the constitution guarantee nondiscrimination against women. &quot;The day when women were treated as chattels is long past,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's organizations, the Botswana Christian Council and the wife of the country's first president all declared support for the decision. But the attorney general said his office had identified numerous statutes that differentiate between men and women. &quot;If we must accept that the ruling applies to all legislation that discriminates against women,&quot; he said, &quot;then we have a big problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2863 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA, NIGERIA -- In their latest resolution on South Africa, African leaders acknowledge that the issue of continued sanctions has been complicated by &quot;positive developments&quot; in the country and the general international reaction to the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abuja Declaration at the Organization of African Unity Summit reaffirms the need for continued pressure on Pretoria while also authorizing Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, the new OAU chairman, to initiate a review of the sanctions policy as soon as South Africa acts to &quot;remove all obstacles to genuine negotiations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, following repeal of the Population Registration Act by the South African Parliament, Babangida announced that he will convene a meeting of the OAU heads-of-state committee on South Africa to decide whether member countries should move towards lifting sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders are hopeful that their careful stance, combining continued insistence on majority rule with recognition of forward movement by South African President F.W. de Klerk, will be sufficient to retain key elements of the embargo, particularly the International Monetary Fund ban on lending to Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit statement, which followed lengthy behind-the-scenes discussions, reflects Babangida's clear intent to break ground on South Africa during his term as chairman. In his major address on opening day, the Nigerian leader promised to &quot;give leadership&quot; on the issue by working for an end to violence and for the &quot;realization of a non-racial society.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changes in South Africa, though welcomed and encouraged, fall short of the benchmark for the ending of sanctions that was established three years ago by OAU governments in the Harare Declaration. Notably, the OAU believes, the South African government has not yet released all of its political prisoners, put an end to political trials, extended amnesty to all political exiles, or curtailed &quot;repressive&quot; security force activity against government opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Should the South African government adopt measures which lead to positive, profound, and irreversible change towards the abolition of apartheid,&quot; the statement says, &quot;we commit ourselves to review the question of sanctions with a view towards readmitting South Africa into the international community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, sanctions are already eroding, thereby undermining their utility as a bargaining chip. The European Community moved to end its restriction on trade and investment, and already many major African countries are busily building new economic links with their southernmost neighbor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress (ANC) delegation, led by Nelson Mandela, arrived at the summit with a proposal for a phased easing of the embargo as a means of leverage in the negotiations with South African President F.W. de Klerk. But when Mandela presented the idea to a late-night session of southern Africa's frontline states prior to the summit opening, there were strong objections voiced by the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC), a smaller South African political movement which enjoys equal standing in the OAU with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't think we should reward de Klerk for doing what should have been done long ago -- eradicate the gross injustices of apartheid,&quot; Gora Ebrahim, PAC foreign secretary said in an interview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Countered the ANC's Thabo Mbeki: &quot;No one is talking about rewarding anybody. What we are saying is that in the light of the erosion that is taking place, what do we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC proposal calls for agreeing to the removal of sanctions in stages, in response to de Klerk's willingness to follow through on the actions he has thus far refused to take. The first restrictions to go would be the ban on air links, the cultural boycott and the bar on sporting ties. Trade and investment bans would follow, with the international arms embargo retained until last.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The significance of the IMF ban on loans goes beyond the amount of financial assistance South Africa may receive. Without IMF imprimatur, Pretoria's access to world capital markets is severely limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Abuja Declaration, redrafted by southern African states following a late-night session of frontline presidents, was adopted by the summit with little discussion. An anticipated floor debate on sanctions failed to materialize, as countries actively pursuing economic ties with South Africa withheld a push to force an immediate change in the organization's historically hardline pro-sanctions approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As OAU chairman, Babangida wants to extend his involvement with South Africa beyond the question of sanctions. During the summit, he offered to convene a meeting of &quot;all shades of political interest&quot; in South Africa and called for the formation of a united front of black forces, including the ANC, PAC, and Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, whose members have been warring with ANC loyalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian leader dropped a paragraph from his prepared text which said the OAU should send a team of foreign ministers to South Africa to &quot;evaluate developments and assist in the process of change.&quot; He also stopped short of offering to meet de Klerk, although his aides acknowledge that a face-to-face session with the South African president has not been ruled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One demonstration of the differences that exist within the OAU membership came two days after the summit ended. Kenya President Daniel arap Moi, a conference participant, played host to de Klerk in Nairobi and agreed to a range of new bilateral links. De Klerk has previously visited Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar and Zaire. On departing Nairobi, he said he would like to meet with Babangida sometime this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya granted landing rights to South African Airways late last year, as did Madagascar. In April, the airline initiated weekly service to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Early this month, the state-owned company was given permission to overfly Mali and Mauritania in west Africa for the first time since 1963, reducing flying time from Johannesburg to London by an hour and saving 10 tons of fuel per plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SOUTH AFRICA: LOOKING BEYOND APARTHEID</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 3, the African National Congress (ANC) is scheduled to convene its first national conference to be held inside South Africa since the organization was banned in 1960. With no resolution in sight to the wave of domestic violence in South Africa, the movement's membership will face a number of pressing problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since being unbanned along with other opposition groups by South African President F.W. de Klerk early last year, the ANC has struggled to make the transition from an underground movement waging a guerilla campaign to a recognized political grouping. It has had overwhelming -- and often conflicting -- pressures thrust upon it, as it simultaneously engaged in difficult negotiations with the government while trying to reconstitute above-ground structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's repeal of the final major piece of overtly segregationist legislation in South Africa, the Population Registration Act of 1950, shifts the focus of South Africa's mass movement from protesting apartheid to the establishment of a multi-party democracy with full political and economic rights for blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By doing away with race-based classification of citizens, Parliament opened the way for adoption of a new constitution. Questions of how such a document will be developed and what its provisions should be are already central features of political debate. But the path to a new constitutional structure that will find broad acceptance has been blocked by the continuation of violence and by differences over security issues and political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is circulating constitutional proposals that it calls &quot;a working draft for consultation.&quot; The draft contains an extensive bill of rights guaranteeing freedom of religion, language, speech and assembly, including trade union liberties and the right to a free press. Further provisions would enshrine environmental rights, universal suffrage, private property, the protection of disabled persons, equal rights for men and women and the abolition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already there has been much public and private discussion of several of the proposed articles, such as the stipulation that natural resources not previously owned will be the property of the state, for the purposes of &quot;reducing inequality, promoting growth and providing goods and services for the whole population.&quot; But perhaps the most controversial element is an article that reserves for the state the right &quot;to enact legislation regulating the manner in which fundamental rights and freedoms shall be exercised or limiting such rights ... as might be deemed necessary in an open and democratic society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several activist groups and coalitions who support the ANC have said they will retain their own independence in order to ensure responsive government. &quot;When the ANC comes to power, we will not disband,&quot; says Kgabisi Mosunkutu, vice-president of the Civic Association of Transvaal -- one of a growing nationwide network of local administrative bodies. &quot;We will become watchdogs to make sure leaders remain accountable to the people and deal with local issues such as housing, water and electricity.&quot; Trade unions, too, have promised their memberships that the groups will not become party organs of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, all the constitutional debates have been overshadowed by the continuing violence, which may have killed as many as 10,000 people in the past six years. While the conflict is generally reported as clashes between the ANC and followers of Chief Gatsha Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party, anti-apartheid critics have long talked about a &quot;third force&quot; that deliberately provokes trouble, with the backing of at least some elements within the South African government. This month that theory was bolstered by the surfacing of retired army major, Nico Basson, who told journalists that he had been part of a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign run by South African military intelligence to undermine opposition. Basson says he personally conducted such activities against Swapo, the party that now governs Namibia, and that current operations against the ANC are supplying weapons and training to Inkatha and encouraging attacks on ANC sympathizers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African defense forces called the charges ridiculous, and Buthelezi angrily denied &quot;any implication that Inkatha would approve of or be a party to deliberately fomenting violence and creating ethnic divisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the wake of the allegations, the South African Council of Churches renewed its campaign to bring together all parties to forge a plan for ending the fighting. Although the ANC withdrew from negotiations with the government, partly over what it said was the government's failure to end the violence, ANC leaders would like to see some improvement in the situation before the July 3 national conference, so that the group's membership can turn its attention to other urgent concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following news analysis is by Anton Harber, co-editor of the Johannesburg Weekly Mail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress faces its moment of reckoning in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When thousands of delegates from around the country gather in Durban for the organization's first proper congress since its unbanning 18 months ago, they will face the formidable challenge of transforming the organization into a coherent, well-structured and tightly run political machine capable of dealing with the massive demands and pressures of the negotiating process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, the organization is weighed down enormously by a great deal of historical baggage.  Since its unbanning on February 2 last year, it has postponed dealing with many of these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It can delay no longer.  The organization's honeymoon period is over and it is under considerable pressure from its alliance partners, the media, local and international political observers, its international supporters and, most important of all, its membership, to sort out lingering problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most media anticipation of the congress has concentrated on personalities, suggesting that the key issues facing the congress will be who gets what job.  This will undoubtedly be relevant, but of more fundamental importance will be whether these people inherit a modernized and workable political structure and whether the gap between them and ANC members is closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the ANC does not deal with these issues in July, it faces little prospect of stemming the slow deterioration in its political and organizational position.  It will enter the critical period of negotiations still carrying the burden of many historical problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A leadership that has been inherited from a period of covert struggle rather than elected to deal with the pressures of a political party.  This means that it carries an overload of incompetence people who hold their position due to long and honorable service rather than merit.  It also means that the leadership is not always accountable to the membership, and this has been a source of frustration to many members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was clearly expressed at last December's consultative conference, at which members demanded an end to secret meetings with the government, an injunction that was ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An anachronistic structure in which many key ANC departments and regions are not even represented in the body making most crucial decisions, the National Executive Committee (NEC).  Thus, for example, the organization's biggest region, the Pretoria/Johannesburg area, can form a view on a critical issue, but since it does not have automatic representation at a national level, it cannot be assured of having its view heard.  Similarly, there is no representative of a department as crucial as the economics department on the NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This had led to gaps between the views of membership and leadership which become dangerous because there is no structured way of mediating such differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A lack of coherent strategic and tactical direction.  ANC policy has often seemed erratic in the last 18 months, motivated as often by the chance proximity of certain individuals to Nelson Mandela and their desire to hold on to their jobs, rather than careful strategic planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An inability to draw on the enormous resources available to it.  The ANC carries enormous goodwill among a wide range of South Africa's best experts (lawyers, economists, educationists...) as well as long-standing activists from ANC-aligned bodies such as the United Democratic Front and Cosatu.  So far, the organization has failed to draw on these resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main reason is that returning exiles have often felt threatened, and have tended to exclude such experts rather than expose their own vulnerability.  The result has been that during negotiations, for example, the team of advisors behind Mandela has not been as strong as it should.  Faced with a government team that has all the state resources and expertise as its command, Mandela has failed to bolster his team with the formidable expertise of lawyers and other professionals available to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC leaders acknowledge many of these problems and express optimism that they will be sorted out at the conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first signs, however, are troubling.  The congress is to consider a new constitution that improves representation on the NEC and the accountability of leadership, but opts for an unworkably large executive of 120 people rather than a tight and more coherent leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with the outgoing NEC being given extraordinary powers (such as being recognized as a region in itself, giving it the power to nominate some of the delegates and electoral candidates), this has led to a growing suspicion that there is a covert attempt to protect the positions of leaders under threat from dissatisfied members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC leaders deny this, but there is little doubt that some of those holding key positions such as general secretary and treasurer general are fighting a rearguard action to avoid being cast out into the cold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little chance of this working, since dissatisfactions with these individuals is widespread.  However, their personal battles to make sure there are jobs for themselves risks making the ANC's structure top-heavy and ponderous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than anything else, the organization needs to develop a sophisticated leadership core that is able to run a tight organization during a difficult period of political uncertainty.  Mandela needs to know that he is surrounded by the best advisers who have the ability and resources to be planning long term strategy, rather than letting the ANC continue to stumble unpredictably from issue to issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To achieve this requires toughness.  The ANC will have to show that it will not allow itself to be slowed by an inability to deal with incompetence and weakness.  If it is to present itself as an alternative government, its leaderhsip will have to demonstrate an ability to deal resolutely with these issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this does not happen at the July conference, it probably never will.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABUJA, NIGERIA -- When Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda was campaigning for his southern African nation's independence from Britain during the early 1960s, Soumana Sacko was the top student at Mopti Elementary School in the west African nation of Mali.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The presence of both men at this month's annual summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was a metaphor for the dramatic changes sweeping the continent. At the age of 66, after 26 years in office, Kaunda is a remnant of the post-colonial generation whose largely autocratic style has dominated African politics until recently. The 40-year-old Sacko, a University of Pittsburgh-trained economist who became Mali's prime minister two months ago, represents the new technocrats whose ascendancy parallels the spread of pro-democracy movements in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the continent's leaders last assembled a year ago, nine of their number have been removed from office by elections or by coups stemming from pro-democracy uprisings. More than a dozen others have been forced to loosen their once-firm grip on power to accommodate demands for pluralism and accountability, and several more stand on the brink of ouster.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stunning pace of change was evident in last-minute shuffles at the summit. Ethiopia's representatives were hurriedly switched, following the rapid collapse of the Ethiopian government as the four-day conference convened. And Algerian Foreign Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali was summoned home by President Chadli Bendjedid, to become prime minister and take charge of his government's escalating confrontation with Islamic fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against that backdrop, this year's OAU summit, meeting in the new Nigerian federal capital of Abuja, drew the largest turnout in a decade.  Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, the incoming OAU chairman, sat the tone when he called for &quot;a sincere embrace&quot; of democracy in his opening address. He said African leaders should dismantle &quot;all apparatus of unrepresentative power&quot; by the end of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three dozen heads of state and government attended the Abuja meeting personally, and all but three of the 51 member states sent delegations. The old guard, like Zambia's Kaunda and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, both under fire at home from advocates of greater pluralism, sat alongside Mali's Sacko and the newly-elected Carlos Viega of Cape Verde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some leaders attended despite their slipping hold on the reins of power. Cameroon's Paul Biya and Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo calmly took their seats, even as protest strikes and demonstrations, demanding their resignations, brought normal life to a halt in both countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The same concerns that are fueling the push for more accountable government across the continent also dominated the agenda of the summit -- how to attack Africa's crippling economic crisis and end the wars that plague every region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main order of business was the approval of a treaty establishing an African Economic Market, similar to the European Community. The treaty calls for the removal of barriers to inter-African trade and travel and the promotion of development through economic integration. The goal is to establish an Africa-wide economic union with a single currency, leading to a Pan-African Parliament with members elected by &quot;continental universal suffrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the creation of a fully-functioning structure is slated to take over three decades. After the treaty-signing ceremony, World Bank President Barber Conable urged Africa's leaders to take the necessary next steps to make the far-reaching design a reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, the outgoing OAU chairman who oversaw the drafting process, told his counterparts that integration offers the surest means for reversing what he called &quot;Africa's dismal economic performance in the 1980s.&quot; Small markets created by inherited national borders present a major obstacle to growth and development, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the treaty to take effect, ratification is required by two-thirds of OAU member states, a goal Nigeria's Babangida said he will seek to achieve during his one-year term as organization chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as the leaders moved towards union, they found themselves confronted by countervailing pressures towards greater divisions. Much of an eight-hour closed session on the third day of the summit was taken up with consideration of the regional conflicts that are responsible for so much of Africa's suffering and devastation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU, from its founding in 1963, has recognized the often irrational colonial boundaries and has upheld the &quot;territorial integrity&quot; of member states so the leaders were quick to condemn the recent secessionist move in northern Somalia. A summit resolution calls upon the Somali National Movement to rescind its secession declaration and work for the unity of the country. The African leaders endorsed efforts by Egypt, Djibouti, Sudan and Uganda to convene a national reconciliation conference of all Somali parties to find a democratic solution to the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit also established a five-nation committee, headed by Babangida, to work for the speedy establishment of a broad-based transitional administration in Ethiopia. A three-person delegation representing the interim Ethiopian government, which took power following seizure of the capital by rebels, assured the OAU that the new coalition is committed to the creation of a democratic Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting in the east African nation of Rwanda sparked some of the sharpest exchanges of the conference, participants reported. Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana harshly accused Uganda's Museveni of backing last October's invasion of Rwanda by exiled government opponents, most of them members of the Ugandan National Army who helped bring Museveni to power. But Museveni denied the charge and pledged his cooperation for the five-nation mediation effort led by Zaire's Mobutu, which won summit endorsement as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit also took decisive action aimed at resolving another conflict, the civil war in Liberia. That action came not in the form of a resolution or debate but from the decision to seat Acting President Amos Sawyer, leader of the interim government in Monrovia. A two-man delegation representing rebel leader Charles Taylor, which arrived in Lagos during the summit, was not allowed to come to Abuja to take part in the deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer was welcomed with full honors, including a 21-gun salute and a police-escorted motorcade, and seated along with other government chiefs at the conference. It was a diplomatic breakthrough for Sawyer's administration, which controls the capital Monrovia while Taylor holds much of the rest of the country. Several other African governments are expected to follow Nigeria's lead and reopen their diplomatic missions in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of South Africa, the leaders chose to reiterate previous declarations linking the removal of sanctions to greater progress towards majority rule. However, in recognition of the erosion in sanctions now taking place and the changes already underway in South Africa, the summit authorized Babangida, as OAU chairman, to initiate a review of this position when conditions warrant &quot;readmitting South Africa into the international community&quot; (see page 13).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit also agreed to endorse Babangida's call for a study of reparations to repay Africa for damages incurred from colonialism and slavery.  The OAU is to establish a panel of &quot;eminent&quot; persons from Africa and the African diaspora to examine the issue. &quot;We need to carefully collect and record the evidence so that even the most unsympathetic judge will have to rule in favor of Africa,&quot; Babangida said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking ahead to the election of a new United Nations secretary general later this fall, the leaders agreed it is time to have one of their own in the post. Addressing the assembly on opening day, Javier Perez de Cuellar, the current UN chief who is leaving the job at the end of the year, said Africa &quot;deserves to be given a chance&quot; when the selection is made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders failed to agree on a single candidate, despite speculation that Babangida was seeking to win endorsement for his old commanding officer, former head of state Olusegun Obasanjo. Summit participants said consensus was ruled out in advance by fierce resistance to any Nigeria-led effort from countries like Zimbabwe, who has a candidate of its own (see Africa News, May 20, 1991). Instead, the leaders established a five-member committee of African United Nations ambassadors to screen potential candidates and coordinate the election effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leading contenders, in addition to Obasanjo, are Ghana's Kenneth Dadzie, a veteran United Nations official who heads the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Sierra Leone's James Jonah, the UN undersecretary-general for political affairs, and Zimbabwean Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero. Other well-known figures who have received mention are Olara Otunnu, a former Ugandan foreign minister who heads the International Peace Academy in New York, Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, and former foreign minister of Nigeria Joseph Garba, who was president of the last session of the United Nations General Assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pledging to wage &quot;a vigorous campaign&quot; for Africa's candidature, Babangida said that by fielding several strong candidates the continent could enhance the chances that one would emerge with sufficient support from the permanent members of the Security Council, particularly the U.S., which dominate the selection process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last September, Africa News (Volume 34, Number 1) presented a chronology of the first nine months of civil war in Liberia. The following sequel was prepared with the help of Scott Stern, an American reporter who has covered the subsequent nine months from the Liberian capital, Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 1990 10: Despite the death of President Samuel K. Doe, fighting intensifies throughout the week. Remnants of Doe's former army -- the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and a rebel group led by Prince Johnson continue efforts to keep Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) from gaining control of the capital.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 15: With Monrovia virtually inaccessible to outside assistance, Catholic Relief Services opens an office in the port city of Buchanan to reach Liberians throughout the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 30: The first distribution of international relief items begins in Monrovia, where a dwindling population has been cut off from all food sources. About 80,000 people are supplied with rice, cooking oil and fish provided by the United Nations World Food Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> October 20: To combat severe malnutrition among Monrovian children, a local volunteer self-help group known as SELF (Special Emergency Life Food Program) begins supplying concentrated porridge to about 70,000 children under the age of 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 28: The west African peacekeeping force sent by six members of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) steps up efforts to end the fighting. The force, known as Ecomog (for Ecowas Monitoring Group), provides artillery support for an assault by Johnson's troops, to push Taylor's soldiers to the north and away from Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> November 2: For the first time since June, a newspaper is published in Monrovia.  The Torchlight, edited by Stanley Peabody, appears with sponsorship by Ecomog, which blocks publication on the back page of a photo of Doe's body after his torture and death at the hands of Johnson and his men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5: Brig. Gen. David Nimley, the AFL commander and former close associate of Doe, flees the country. His replacement, Gen. J. Hezekiah Bowen assumes command and pledges cooperation with Johnson and the Ecomog forces, led by Lt. Gen.  Arnold Quainoo of Ghana and Nigerian Gen. Joshua Dogonyaro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9: With fighting continuing in several areas of Monrovia, Taylor's troops retake the university campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 21: Amos Sawyer arrives in Monrovia to head an interim government 11 weeks after his selection by representatives of Liberian political, civic and professional groups, meeting in neighboring Gambia under Ecowas auspices. The inauguration takes place the following day. Under the Ecowas plan, Sawyer is barred from running for the presidency in the elections scheduled for October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 30: Meeting in Bamako, Mali in an extraordinary summit, Ecowas heads of state give unanimous endorsement to the Ecowas peace plan and the interim government. Leaders of all the warring factions, along with Sawyer, also endorse the plan and sign a cease-fire declaration. But Taylor immediately expresses doubts about the fairness of the Ecowas approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> December 3: After an unsuccessful attack on AFL barracks by Taylor's forces, Ecomog assumes control of downtown Monrovia and nearby Bushrod Island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 20: The Ecowas Standing Mediation Committee convenes a meeting of all sides in Bangul, Gambia. Sawyer, Johnson, and Bowen take part, but Taylor stays home and sends his defense secretary, Tom Woewiyu. The following day, the parties agree to open sea and air ports in the country and call for an All Liberia Conference to find a political settlement for the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> January 1991 10: The United States suspends military evacuations, which have airlifted over 500 Americans and other foreign nationals from Monrovia since August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23: A technical team drawn from the three warring factions fails to agree on a disarmament plan after Taylor's group insists that a new interim government be put into place first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> February 13: Another meeting of the warring parties is organized by Ecowas in Lome, Togo, and after lengthy discussions ends with a comprehensive cease-fire accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> March 1: After informal talks mediated by Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema in Lome, Sawyer and Taylor announce agreement on arrangements for an All Liberia peace conference, to be convened by Ecowas in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10: Ecowas launches a series of &quot;confidence visits&quot; to areas under Taylor's control, as well as to Johnson's bases and AFL-held positions. The visits are seen as a prelude to opening all the country's roads and ports, as stipulated in the Banjul agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 15: The All Liberia Conference opens, but Taylor fails to appear. A delegation from Taylor's NPFL objects to participation of delegations from civic, professional and religious groups and demands that representatives from each of Liberia's counties be seated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 27: The NPFL delegation walks out of the peace conference complaining that the meeting was ignoring Taylor's call for a three-person ruling council to run the country until elections are held. Taylor said that he, Sawyer and a third neutral figure should form the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 29: The NPFL delegates return but refuse to take part in conference deliberations. The delegation chairman, Toga MacIntosh, resigns, saying Taylor is blocking peace efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 31: NPFL forces clash with Sierra Leone troops along the Liberian-Sierra Leonean border. As the fighting escalates, Sierra Leone President Joseph Momoh accuses Taylor of seeking to destabilize the country in retaliation for its involvement in Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> April 5: NPFL denies invading Sierra Leone, blaming the trouble on domestic opponents of President Momoh. Guinea and Nigeria agree to send troops to assist Sierra Leone's poorly equipped army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13: Sierra Leone cuts off sea and air traffic with Liberia, and Liberian refugees report harassment and intimidation by Sierra Leonean security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 19: The All Liberia Conference concludes by re-electing Sawyer as president.  The conference approves the creation of two vice president positions, one for each rebel group. Prince Johnson names former minister of labor, Peter Naigow, but Taylor refuses to cooperate, insisting on his troika proposal as the only workable plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 27: The new Ecomog commander, Gen. Ruphus Kupolati of Nigeria, visits Taylor at his headquarters in Gbarnga, 125 miles from Monrovia. Kupolati restates Ecowas neutrality in Liberia, and Taylor denies involvement in the Sierra Leone fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 29: Sawyer swears in a new interim legislative assembly and gives Taylor 30 days to fill the seats reserved for the NPFL in the assembly and government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> May 8: Over 2,500 Liberian refugees arrive in Monrovia by ship from Freetown, Sierra Leone in the first large-scale repatriation since fighting began. With several thousand people crossing from Taylor-held areas into Monrovia each week, the city's population swells to an estimated 800,000 -- about one-third of the country's 2.3 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 27: Taylor swears in the second National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly in Gbarnga, pledging to fight until &quot;final victory&quot; against what he calls an Ecowas aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 30: Commercial banks reopen in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 3: Sawyer takes Liberia's seat at the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity in Abuja, Nigeria. Taylor's delegation is turned back at Lagos.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN--A quiet initiative by west African governments appears to offer a fragile new hope for ending the civil war in Liberia that has killed thousands of people, made half the population refugees, and spilled across borders into neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although west Africans have been divided over the 17-month-long Liberian conflict, rebel incursions into Sierra Leone and Guinea have spurred the renewed effort to forge a common approach by the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).  Already, an Ecowas peacekeeping force with Sierra Leonean and Guinean participation patrols the Liberian capital, Monrovia, where an interim government operates under west African auspices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interim government scored an important breakthrough this month at the annual Organization of African Unity summit in Nigeria.  Acting President Amos Sawyer, leading a delegation from Monrovia, was received with full honors and seated alongside over 30 other African heads of state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to find a solution in Liberia were given fresh impetus earlier this month by the spread of fighting into new areas of Sierra Leone and by reports from fleeing refugees of continued killings by rebel forces in southeastern Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">West African governments are seeking to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on Charles Taylor, leader of the main Liberian rebel group, who pulled his delegation out of an Ecowas-sponsored &quot;All Liberian Conference&quot; in April designed to lead to free elections later this year.  A two-person delegation sent by Taylor to Nigeria was not allowed to travel to Abuja to take part in summit deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer's participation in the OAU sessions followed a flurry of diplomacy within the region as well as stepped-up activity in Liberia by the Ecowas peacekeeping force.  Last month, after Sawyer visited several area capitals to bolster support for the west African initiative, Ecowas forces in Liberia took the first steps to blockade the port of Buchanan, 65 miles southeast of Monrovia, which Taylor has been using to export timber and rubber to finance his rival administration.  At least one ship carrying raw materials has been diverted to Monrovia, where the cargo was seized.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The behind-the-scenes maneuvering points up the importance of two figures -- President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire, Africa's longest-serving head of state, and President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, the region's dominant economic and political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians supply half of the 7,000 Ecowas forces and are central to any widened action by the peacekeeping troops.  Cote d'Ivoire shares a 350-mile border with Liberia and was initially seen as sympathetic to Taylor's efforts to oust former Liberian dictator Samuel Doe, who was killed by another rebel group last September.  But more recently, after the Taylor delegation left the peace conference and the fighting began in Sierra Leone, Ivoirian leaders have appeared to share a growing concern in the region about Taylor's intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ivoirian view will assume even more importance if the Ecowas blockade is extended, because this country could then become Taylor's only potential outlet for exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, Taylor controls most of Liberia's territory, although much of the population has fled to neighboring countries or to Monrovia, which now harbors about one third of the country's 2.3 million people.  Taylor, who views the Ecowas plan to sponsor elections as a Nigerian-directed ploy to bar him from power, insists that he either head the interim government or share leadership with Sawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer, who is barred by the peace plan from running for the presidency, has challenged Taylor to test his popularity at the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Bush administration has provided a boost for the west African efforts.  Late last month, the U.S. Justice Department asked a Federal court to &quot;confer standing&quot; on the interim Liberian government that would allow it to &quot;present claims and defenses for the Republic of Liberia.&quot; The action means that the Sawyer government can move to contest a lawsuit filed by an international bank for non-payment of the country's debts and thereby seek to free some of Liberian's internationally-held assets that have been frozen by previous legal actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Success of those attempts would be a crucial victory for the Sawyer administration.  The Doe regime left the Liberian treasury bankrupt, and the interim government has been operating with virtually no resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is not official, formal recognition,&quot; said Leonard Robinson, deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa, in a telephone interview from Washington.  &quot;But it does indicate our support for the efforts Ecowas is making.&quot; Robinson said the U. S. &quot;will follow suit&quot; as west African states establish diplomatic relations with the government in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberia, which was founded in 1822 by freed American slaves, has had close cultural, political and economic ties with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A meeting between Sawyer and Taylor, called by Congressman Mervyn Dymally, a California Democrat who chairs the House Africa subcommittee, was planned last month.  But after west African leaders objected that Dymally's public involvement could sidetrack the Ecowas initiative, Sawyer was reluctant to attend and Dymally cancelled the session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are saddened that this meeting did not take place,&quot; said Ernest Eastman, a seasoned Liberian diplomat now serving as Taylor's foreign minister.  &quot;We believed this offered the possibility for finding a solution acceptable to both sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Taylor's critics believe he is trying to stall the peace process for economic reasons.  &quot;He is shipping timber, iron ore, diamonds and rubber out of the country and depositing the proceeds in a private Swiss bank account,&quot; says Paul Reichler, a Washington, D.C. attorney representing the interim government.  &quot;The longer it takes to settle, the more he can accumulate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Nigeria is taking steps to push the Ecowas process forward.  President Ibrahim Babangida has dispatched over a thousand troops to Sierra Leone, where they could be used in a pincer action against Taylor's forces, if Ecowas decides to move against Taylor from Monrovia.  And the Nigerian embassy in Monrovia has been reopened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next phase of the Ecowas peace plan calls for opening the country's roads, enabling relief supplies to reach areas desperately in need of food and medicines, and beginning the process of reuniting the many divided families. The Women's Committee for Refugee Women and Children, a New York-based group that recently sent a mission to Liberia and the border areas, reported this month that five to ten thousand people a week are returning to Monrovia from refugee camps or slipping across Taylor lines to seek the resources available in Monrovia and the protection of Ecowas troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With pressures on the city's services growing, Monrovia's lively, resurgent press is becoming increasingly critical of the west African force for &quot;foot dragging&quot; in implementing the peace plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An immense human tragedy unfolding in the Horn of Africa has made northeast Africa the &quot;most serious global crisis&quot; according to James Ingram, executive director of the World Food Program. During a tour of the region this month, the head of the United Nations agency appealed to area governments as well as to donor nations to take immediate and decisive action to save the lives of millions of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of collapsing governments in Ethiopia and Somalia and a continuing civil war in Sudan, combined with severe drought, has put more than 20 million people at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingram warned that the world has been numbed by the prevalence of disasters this year. &quot;We've got to bring home to people that the situation (in the Horn) is so grave that we must act with as much resolution as we have acted in some of the other crises of 1991,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In southern Ethiopia, over seven million people living in remote, hard-to-reach areas face imminent starvation. Several hundred thousand Sudanese refugees in eastern Ethiopia who have been cut off from food supplies have fled back into Sudan. Somali refugees in the same area are flooding into Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ingram said he had been &quot;encouraged&quot; by his contacts with the interim government that took control of the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa in early June. But the new authorities face a massive task of food distribution, and they have neither money nor fuel to do the job, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the rebel army marched into Addis Ababa late last month, after the flight of military dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, many Ethiopians were uncertain whether to cheer or run for cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 44-year reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, who ran the country like a feudal fiefdom, plus 17 years of harsh military administration, has intensified regional rivalries and left the northeastern African nation bereft of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels came mainly from the north, and there were fears in the capital that their arrival would introduce new tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To combat those worries, the rebel coalition made a pledge to press forward with the task of establishing a broad-based government. It promised to convene a conference of all former opposition forces in Ethiopia by the beginning of July. That meeting will be charged with establishing a transitional government to run the country for the period required to organize national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anyone who wants to participate in a peaceful and democratic transition in our country is welcome,&quot; says Acting President Meles Zenawi.  Zenawi heads the Tigrean People's Liberation Front, the Ethiopian movement with the largest guerrilla army. In the interim administration, the Tigrayans are allied with two other groups under the banner of a coalition known as the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new authorities in Addis have set as first priorities the establishment of law and order and the provision of food to those most desperately in need. &quot;We have already undertaken the gigantic task of dismantling the largest army in Africa,&quot; said Dawit Yohannes, a senior interim government official, interviewed at the Organization of African Unity summit in Nigeria earlier this month. &quot;But the government is bankrupt,&quot; he said. &quot;The last regime literally evacuated every coin we had.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major long-term task ahead is national unification. &quot;Our goal is a democratic Ethiopia in which no group will face discrimination,&quot; said Dawit, a member of the Ethiopian Peoples Democratic Movement -- composed mainly of Amharas, the country's largest ethnic group -- who are concentrated in the center of the country around Addis Ababa. The coalition also includes an organization of Oromos, another large population group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have over 70 different kinds of people, with their own languages and cultures and strong sense of national identity,&quot; Dawit said. &quot;We have to find a way to build a multinational entity within our borders.&quot; But he said the EPRDF recognizes &quot;the right of self-determination up to and including secession.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, the EPRDF has agreed to political autonomy for Eritrea, a former Italian colony which Emperor Selassie annexed in 1962, sparking a thirty-year independence war which ended only with Mengistu's downfall. It was the military campaign by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF) that inspired other guerrilla movements and finally undermined the military regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three decades of war claimed 1.5 million casualties in Ethiopia, plus untold numbers on the Eritrean side, Dawit said. &quot;We not only lost these human resources; we have been drained as a society.&quot; The result is that the area, once highly productive, has become excessively vulnerable to starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So we say this Eritrean problem has to be resolved democratically,&quot; Dawit said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An agreement on Eritrea's future was worked out in London during peace talks chaired by Herman Cohen, the U.S. assistant secretary of State for Africa. While a transitional government is running Ethiopia for up to two years -- drafting a new constitution and conducting national elections -- the EPLF will administer Eritrea. Once a democratically-elected administration assumes power in Addis Ababa, it will organize a referendum in Eritrea to determine whether the people there want an independent state, unification with Ethiopia, or some sort of federation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawit said the two-year transition period envisioned by the London conference is needed to repair the damage previous regimes have done to the nation. &quot;The level of neglect, particularly of the Ogaden, is incredible,&quot; he said, referring to the southern region of the country along the border with Somalia, where the most severe starvation is concentrated. &quot;You will not find a clinic there, you will not find any urban center of government, even though it is nearly as big as Texas,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1000 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUSAKA -- The crowd at the rally for the United National Independence Party (Unip), which has ruled Zambia for 27 years, was sparse and bored.  Most of those attending were market women, afraid of losing their retail licenses if they failed to show up for Unip events. During the speeches, they swatted at flies and nodded off to sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the rally's few rousing moments offered a dramatic illustration of the extent to which popular support for the government of President Kenneth Kaunda has eroded.  When a local party official attempted to lead a chant of the familiar Unip slogan, &quot;One Zambia, one nation!,&quot; he found himself facing a unified chorus of &quot;Sugar!,&quot; a reference to persistent shortages of key commodities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dissent isn't new to Zambia, where economic difficulties have spawned several violent protests in recent years.  Last week, amid opposition calls for international monitoring of the balloting, Kaunda announced that he had invited former U. S. presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford to observe the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between Unip and the main opposition group, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), are marked by growing antagonism.  In the daily newspapers, rival party officials exchange accusations of corruption and lying.  Unip usually wins the battle of the newsprint, if only because it owns one of the two major papers, the Zambia Daily Mail, and has claimed in a lawsuit to own the other paper, the Times of Zambia, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both papers are unabashedly pro-Unip.  Typical of the tone is a two-inch front-page headline that screams, &quot;Unip Buries Opposition.&quot; The story is about a few local officials who buried a coffin labeled MMD at a small political rally.  Coverage of ministerial speeches extolling the virtues of Unip is common fare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite its belief that the media has shut it out, the MMD, led by Frederick Chiluba, former head of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions, appears to be gathering grassroots support. Party rallies attract thousands of enthusiastic people.  The gatherings are part politics, part social event, and part religious ceremony, where exuberant chants of the party's slogan -- &quot;The hour has come&quot; -- refer both to the ascension of Jesus and the MMD's quest for political power.  Tunes once routinely sung at Unip events now sport MMD lyrics.  Charges from critics that MMD leaders have a tarnished past, including drug smuggling and corrupt business deals, don't appear to have dampened what has become almost a passion among Zambians for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fueling the fervor are the deteriorating economic conditions, which years of reform efforts by both the Zambian government and international financial institutions have failed to correct.  The economic crisis followed a period of growth and prosperity that ended in 1975, when international copper prices dropped by nearly half.  Zambia is the world's fifth largest copper producer, and until recently, the Zambian economy earned 95% of its foreign exchange from the mining of metals, including lead and zinc as well as copper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Encouraged by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the Zambian government decided to borrow heavily to offset losses from the fall in commodity prices, which were expected to be temporary.  But low world prices have continued, and the combination of decreasing earnings and mounting debt has sent Zambia's economy -- along with those of most African countries -- into a tailspin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost the only good news on the economic front is Zambia's success in significantly boosting per capita food production since 1980, to the point where the country is now self-sufficient in maize. In previous years, according to Canadian economist John Loxley, Zambia was importing over 300,000 tons of maize at a cost of nearly $ 70 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that gain has done little to counter the general economic decline.  Between 1981 and 1986, the real wages of low, middle and top grade Zambian miners fell by 56%, 77% and 84% respectively.  The amount of money the country now needs, just to service its debt and arrears, is the equivalent of 150% of its annual export earnings.  Urban dwellers must cope with unemployment and a 100% inflation rate over the last two years.  Decaying government services have spawned a dilapidated transport system and crumbling schools.  Poor sanitary conditions helped fuel an outbreak of cholera this year that has claimed hundreds of lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting tensions have emboldened government opponents and discomfited ruling party officials.  Last month the University of Zambia was closed suddenly for undisclosed reason, amid rumors that students planned to demonstrate in favor of an interim government to supervise elections -- an option Kaunda has rejected. Paramilitary troops and police in riot gear staged a dawn raid on the Lusaka campus, trundling the entire student body onto buses for home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heavy-handed action and the government's sensitivity to criticism has raised public concern about the fairness of the coming vote.  Some highly-placed government officials privately predict that if Kaunda loses at the polls, he may use force to remain in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In apparent moves to improve his chance of winning, Kaunda has promoted several people who were political fence-sitters and has appointed seven other waverers to district governorships.  Government measures to stem popular discontent include a scheme to get extra taxis and buses on the roads to relieve the transportation shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Unip's main strategy seems to be to split the opposition.  Unip alleges that the MMD appeals to &quot;tribalism&quot; and that only the ruling party can ensure a united, non-ethnic-based government.  Rumors are also circulating that Unip has helped finance smaller political parties to try to weaken the MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On its side, the MMD hopes to pin the blame for Zambia's bankruptcy on Unip mismanagement, a charge that, at the moment, does not seem to be falling on deaf ears.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two weeks ago, the Foreign Minister of Madagascar told reporters in Togo that he had delivered a message of support to that country's beleaguered president, Gnassingbe Eyadema. The message, from Malagasy President Didier Ratsiraka, encouraged Eyadema to stand firm against anti-government demonstrators, whose strikes had paralyzed the Togolese capital for several weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hours later, the foreign minister received news that over 100,000 people were in the streets of his own capital city, making the same demand as the Togolese protestors -- a national conference to chart a course towards democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Togo's Atlantic coast capital, Lome, is over 3,500 miles from Antananarivo, the Malagasy capital on the Indian Ocean. But in the last year, it has become commonplace for events in one part of the vast African continent to reverberate in another. Largely unnoticed by a world preoccupied with developments elsewhere, Africans are moving with astonishing similarity and persistence to demand responsive, accountable governments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three decades after African countries began to gain formal independence from their colonial powers, they are -- in the view of a growing number of political analysts -- beginning to find their own voice. &quot;We have had less than 30 years of independence,&quot; says Siaka Coulibaly, a senior economic advisor to the government of Cote d'Ivoire. &quot;Where was America 30 years after its independence?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, Africans say, they are trying to chart their futures in a world that is far more complex, interdependent and dangerous than the one confronted by most young nations in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every African government faces a host of problems, and most are gripped by economic crises whose causes are deeply rooted and impervious to easy solutions. At the same time, however, it is impossible to travel in Africa today without encountering an atmosphere of hopeful excitement, particularly in places where popular movements are spreading at either the local or national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some western diplomats express concern that the continent's democracy fervor will sour, when newly elected governments prove unable to deliver the economic miracles that many protestors seem to expect. But that prospect appears unlikely to mute the demands for rapid change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the campaigns which are pressing for national political conferences or have already won the battle to hold them are the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Togo, following weeks of strikes and demonstrations that included violent clashes between protestors and police, President Eyadema agreed to opposition demands for a national conference on the country's political future. Delegates gathering in Lome this week are expected to select a prime minister, who will head a transitional government to rule until multi-party elections take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to hold the conference was hammered out in a June 12 session between a coalition of 11 opposition parties and the president, who has kept a virtually unchallenged grip on power since a 1967 coup. Although street protests had mounted for several months, Eyadema bowed to the demand for a conference after an opposition-sponsored general strike brought transportation in Lome to a halt and shut down most offices, banks and schools in the capital. To secure the president's cooperation, the opposition agreed to allow Eyadema to remain as head-of-state until a new government is elected and to stand for election himself if he chooses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In nearby Cameroon, President Paul Biya has continued to rebuff similar demands for a national conference from an opposition coalition. Last week, after the government announced a ban on political meetings, the coalition said it would begin an economic blockade of the capital, Yaounde, which is 150 miles inland and dependent on supplies from the coastal city of Douala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yondo Black, a lawyer who heads the opposition's coordinating committee, said the ban on meetings is illegal and will be ignored. The opposition also announced a general strike for this week and said that if Biya has not agreed to a conference before July 5, there will be a march on the presidential palace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growing militancy of the opposition has caused several smaller opposition parties to withdraw from the coalition, but the bulk of the protest movement appears to be united behind the pressure tactics. Dr. Moses Tesi, a Cameroonian political analyst who directs the Institute of African Affairs, said in an interview that the breakaway parties pose little threat to the opposition campaign, as many of their leaders have served in former regimes.  &quot;These people were part of the government during the period when there was no democracy,&quot; he said. &quot;How do we know that they will not return to their old ways?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya has held power since 1982. More than 30 people have died in the last two months of protest against his rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Burkina Faso, a landlocked west African country north of Cote d'Ivoire, President Blaise Campaore, who seized power in a 1987 coup, faces stiff criticism, despite recent reforms that permitted opposition parties and presented a new constitution to voters. After the constitution was approved in a June 2 ballot, Campaore named a new cabinet that included opposition politicians, although 21 out of 34 members are from the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 11 of 25 opposition parties -- who say they want a greater role in shaping the evolving government structures -- are boycotting consultations between the new parties and the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Campaore was forced to appoint three new Cabinet members, after three opposition leaders resigned amid mounting public pressure to reduce the president's term from seven years to five. Presidential elections are now slated for November 3, with parliamentary balloting to follow on December 8.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In the Congo, the continent's longest-running national conference ended June 10 after three months of sometimes stormy debate about the country's past political failures and its future. The proceedings were broadcast live on national television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the conference closing, President Denis Sassou-Nguesso took part in a hand-washing ceremony symbolizing forgiveness, along with former President Joachim Yhombi Opango, whom Sassou-Nguesso ousted in 1979 and imprisoned without trial for eleven years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference took away from the president most of his powers and named a prime minister, Andre Milongo, to head the government and take command of the army during the one-year transition to democratic rule. A constitutional referendum will be held in November, legislative elections next March, and a presidential vote in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference participants voiced harsh criticism of Sassou-Nguesso's 12 years in power, alleging corruption, mismanagement, and physical intimidation of opponents. The meeting established a tribunal to probe the assets of the president and his colleagues and to seek repatriation of any funds illegally deposited in foreign banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Next door in Zaire, President Mobutu Sese Seko has set July 10 as the opening day for his country's national conference. A previous effort to convene a meeting on April 29 failed when leading opposition groups accused the president of trying to dominate the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An upsurge in discontent forced concessions from Mobutu, who has ruled the country since a 1965 takeover. Last year, he legalized opposition parties but their activities are still curtailed. A rally planned a week ago in Kinshasa by several major opposition groups, including the Union pour la Democratie and le Progress Social (UPDS) led by Etienne Tshisikedi, was blocked by the arrest of Tshisikedi and three other UPDS leaders, who were held for several hours before being released. According to UPDS officials, several hundred party supporters were wounded when police fired on a crowd which gathered for the planned protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The march towards pluralism in Niger took an unusual path last month when thousands of women marched to demand inclusion in the committee to plan that country's national conference. Their demand was accepted, and women are now among the dozens of planners representing political parties, students, workers and civic associations who have been laboring for over a month to lay the groundwork for the meeting. Originally scheduled to begin at the end of May, the conference is now expected to start sometime next month. Delegates are to choose a prime minister to take over administrative powers from Colonel Ali Saibou, who assumed power four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Protests that brought out 100,000 people in Madagascar on June 11 were the beginning of a series of demonstrations against the regime of President Didier Ratsiraka that have continued to mount. The protesters in Antananarivo, capital of the Indian Ocean island nation, have been calling for an end to Ratsiraka's 16-year rule and for a national conference to draft a new constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Laurent Gbagbo, leader of the Ivoirian Popular Front (FPI), one of the major opposition parties, is calling for the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Allasane Ouattara. Gbagbo, who ran against Houphouet-Boigny in last year's presidential elections -- the first multiparty contest in Cote d'Ivoire's history -- said the dispatch of the army to university residence halls at 1:00 am raises serious doubts about the government's competence to handle the affairs of state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are excerpts from Gbagbo's response to the president's speech, from an interview last week with La Voie, a new daily newspaper which supports Gbagbo's FPI:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the president's declaration had been made the 18th of May, the affair would have been quickly circumscribed. There would certainly have been neither the strikes nor the demonstrations. But coming one month after the beginning of the problem, the speech is incomplete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the 18th of May, the government has made four pronouncements.  They were all designed to subdue the emotions of the people of Cote d'Ivoire and to portray the affair as a normal police action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But essential questions remain. Who gave the order to the military to enter the university? Why was the army used and not just the police?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come demonstrate with us to show the government that it must learn to respect Ivoirians.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">455 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a June 16 speech to the nation, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny spoke about the May 17 security force raid on a university residence hall in the suburb of Yopougon where students claim four people were killed -- a charge the government denies -- and about opposition demands for an international commission of inquiry into the incident. Here are excerpts from the address:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What happened that night at Yopougon is a sad event that we regret, that we deplore, and about which immediate action will be taken. But before announcing the measure that I'm taking today, I first want to remind you of some realities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that the commission we are going to create today is going to shed total light on what happened at Yopougon. But the commission will only be composed of our citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I spent 15 years in the French parliament and I participated in six governments. But we would think it odd if the French were to appeal to their friends to come to solve the problems that occur in France. So let's stop this talk of having foreigners intervene in our affairs. We are adult enough, whatever it costs us, to solve our own problems ourselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission will be composed of 32 members -- and I underline this -- who will be freely chosen by the groups of which they are members. The commission will choose its own president and staff. Commission members will operate with complete independence to clarify for us what happened at Yopougon. They will need to obey nothing but their own consciences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I have often said to you that I have three judges: God, my conscience and the people. Therefore, the commissioners must obey their consciences. And I appeal to Ivoirians who have any complaints to put them freely before the commission, without hesitation. No one will have anything to fear from telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My dear brothers and sisters, since 1943 I have enjoyed the confidence of the valiant and generous people of Cote d'Ivoire. Confidence, as you all know, is very difficult to acquire but, unfortunately, very easy to lose. I don't want to lose the confidence of Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I was very young, I pledged before God never to shed, or cause to be shed, a single drop of human blood. You know that Cote d'Ivoire has not abolished the death penalty -- and it falls to your humble servant to decide the fate of those who are condemned to death. Up to this day, I have never allowed the execution of a single condemned person. So how could I dream -- for a single instant -- of snuffing out the life of one of our students, our dear children, our reason for being? Besides their families, our dear children can find no one who loves them more than I do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">God is love. I thank you.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN-- Cote d'Ivoire, one of the first countries to respond to pro-democracy movements by allowing opposition parties, unfettering the press and holding presidential elections, is in the midst of a second round of political protests that have claimed at least one life in recent weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, the country was jolted out of 30 years of relative political tranquility by waves of demonstrations that came to be known as the &quot;strike of the day.&quot; Everyone from taxi drivers to bankers to soldiers took to the streets in protests that were fueled as much by economic complaints as by political goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, this former French colony of 12 million people has dozens of feisty newspapers, a spirited opposition, and an 86-year-old president who handily won re-election last October. But the political reforms have been unable to stop the slide of an economy dependent on earnings from coffee and cocoa, whose prices have remained at a ten-year low.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a month of mounting tension following a late-night raid on university dormitories, Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara went on television Thursday night to announce the government's decision to dissolve the national student organization and to order teachers back to their classrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current conflicts began last month with a public campaign by students and teachers to protest poor conditions and lack of resources in the education system. Sporadic strikes broke out, despite stern government warnings to protesters. The dispute became a crisis on the night of May 17, when more than a dozen students were injured and several women students reportedly were raped as troops swept through student residence halls to round-up suspected ring-leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Student and opposition groups claimed that four students were killed, but the government has maintained that there were no deaths. The bureau chief of the Agence France-Press news agency was promptly expelled from the country for reporting the student allegations without first checking the story with the authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campus incidents sparked the first street demonstrations seen in this administrative capital since last fall's elections. Amid calls for an investigation and demands for the government to resign, authorities issued a series of statements suggesting the action was taken in response to a plot by students and teachers to disrupt the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With protests continuing, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny made a nationally-televised appeal for students and teachers to return to their classrooms. The June 15 speech announced the creation of a 32-member panel of inquiry, composed of judges, members of parliament, parents of students, religious leaders and attorneys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the announcement failed to defuse campus tensions, and last Monday a confrontation erupted be-tween members of the striking stu-dent federation and a student accused by the others of leading a group of government-paid thugs. The accused, Thierry Zebie, was killed with sticks and iron bars, and pictures of his bloody body were displayed on newscasts of the government-controlled television network and the front page of the official newspaper. Students and some teachers told journalists that the attack on Zebie came in response to his firing on student activists, but no gun has been produced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of the raid and the government's handling of the ensuing troubles, opposition leaders have called for the resignation of Ouattara's seven-month-old government. The prime minister, a central banker and former International Monetary Fund official widely respected for his competence, was appointed after last year's protests, with the assignment of getting the Ivoirian economy back on track -- a task that has required a series of painful reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political and economic reforms have left opposition leaders split over the issue of a national conference to chart Cote d'Ivoire's immediate future. Laurent Gbagbo, the leader of the Ivoirian Popular Front (FPI) who ran against Houphouet-Boigny in last October's presidential elections, has backed away from the demand for a conference that was issued by all the leading opposition groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the November parliamentary vote, the FPI won nine seats in the 175-member National Assembly and is expected to have at least one representative on the panel of inquiry into the university events. Even so, the front has taken its demand for the gov-ernment's resignation into the streets, mobilizing tens of thousands of marchers in demonstrations that con-tinued through the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The economic reform package, developed in coordination with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, is contributing to the government's political difficulties. &quot;We have to reduce employment in the public sector drastically, and that is surely not popular,&quot; said one finance ministry official. The cuts in expenditures on education are a major cause for the unrest in the schools and at the university, which has more than 20,000 enrolled on a campus designed for 7,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this trouble is a result of our poverty,&quot; said Foreign Minister Amara Essy in an interview last week. &quot;People think our government is not doing a good job, but the drop in the price of cocoa has reduced our budget by 70%,&quot; he said. &quot;What can we do?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frustrated by the continuing stalemate in Liberia, West African leaders have proposed a new election timetable for their war-ravaged neighbor. During a summit in Nigeria early this month, heads of state from the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) announced plans to hold a presidential vote in Liberia within six months. They asked for assistance in monitoring the poll from former President Jimmy Carter's International Negotiations Network.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit statement followed a meeting in Cote d'Ivoire on June 30 between five West African presidents and the two principal Liberian leaders -- Amos Sawyer, who heads the interim government based in the capital Monrovia, and Charles Taylor, whose forces control most of the country's territory outside the capital. Meeting for the first time since the fighting started at the end of 1989, Sawyer and Taylor agreed to hold elections under Ecowas auspices. Ecowas currently has a peacekeeping force of 7,000 troops stationed in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To oversee the election process, Ecowas established a five-member committee headed by Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny. Senegalese President Abdul Diouf, the new Ecowas chairman, is also on the panel, along with Gambian President Dawda Jawara, Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, and President Joao Bernardo Vieira of Guinea-Bissau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ecowas communique says each side will be responsible for maintaining security in its territory until the election process begins, but many other details of the transition remain to be resolved. Richard Joseph, a Carter Center representative, was present for the Ecowas summit, where he met with Sawyer and several other leaders. Joseph also had talks with Taylor at his headquarters in Gbarnga, 125 northeast of Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed in Abidjan, Joseph said the current separation of Liberia into two totally separate zones stands in the way of fair elections. &quot;Ways must be found to overcome these divisions and allow free movement of people and goods throughout the country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar has joined the parade of countries that are convening national conferences to pursue democratic reforms. The decision was made during lengthy negotiations between the opposition coalition known as Force Vive and the four parties that constitute the government. The deal was brokered by the Council of Churches.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Didier Ratsiraka, who has ruled for 15 years, had refused all demands for a national conference. But weeks of demonstrations, which brought hundreds of thousands of people into the streets of the capital and other cities, forced him to yield. Despite last week's agreement, a general strike continued in many parts of the country, with protesters saying that pressure on the government must be maintained. The president has continued to insist that he will remain head of state, even if the conference chooses a transitional administration to guide the country toward elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A preparatory committee to plan the conference will have 12 members from the government, 12 members from the opposition and seven from the Council of Churches. Asked about the swing votes the Council will possess, a church leader said that religious organizations have a duty to help the country develop a new constitution and to work to improve the nation's economic situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madagascar isn't the only place where the church is playing a central role in political reforms. Last month the national conference in Congo elected Bishop Ernest Nkombo, who has been presiding at the sessions, to head the newly-established Supreme Council of the Republic. The 153-member Council will govern as a legislative body for the next 12 months and will organize elections projected for May of next year. Earlier, conference delegates had reduced Congolese President Dennis Sassou-Nguesso's role to representing the nation at ceremonial occasions and to signing international treaties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Ethiopia, the new custodians of state power -- the Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front -- delighted the church community by ordering the demolition of a fence that had walled off Trinity Cathedral in the capital Addis Ababa. The church filled with worshippers on Friday after the barrier came down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan -- Parliamentarians from Africa, North America, Europe and Australia, meeting in Cote d'Ivoire for a north-south roundtable on African debt, declared last week that the promotion of democracy is the most important goal for achieving economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing the notion that economic reforms, including painful cutbacks in government programs and spending, require strong-arm governments to impose the tough measures on reluctant publics, the conference statement said that &quot;economic reforms must be fully transparent, answering to the interests and will of the African peoples.&quot; Only a government that is accountable to its people, the document says, can pursue a sustainable development program.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The debt roundtable took place as the leaders of the world's seven most powerful industrialized nations prepared to gather in London for their annual meeting.  The parliamentarians said that the so-called G-7 countries, who will &quot;decide the economic future of the world for the next year,&quot; should put Africa's economic crisis high on their agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although debt is one serious problem among many, the roundtable statement said that &quot;debt relief is a necessary precondition for solving these problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The roundtable was held against a background of African debt that has increased faster than anywhere else in the developing world. In the last 12 years, the continent's external debt has grown from $ 48.3 billion to $277.7 billion. And as the debt burden and the payments to support it mushroomed, African countries have slipped down the ladder of world economic rankings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organization of African Trade Union Unity points out that during the decade of the 1980s, &quot;the number of African least-developed countries rose from 17 to 29 and several middle-income African countries tripped into low-income countries, but significantly, not one African country rose to the ranks of a high-income country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, former Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, who is the United Nations Secretary- General's Special Advisor on the debt crisis, told the UN General Assembly that the economic problems of sub-Saharan African nations appear &quot;insolvable without drastically reducing their debt.&quot; Craxi called for &quot;exceptional concessionary measures&quot; by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) is also campaigning for debt relief. It argues that although Africa's debt problem is not large in world terms -- which means that the continent tends to be overlooked in discussions about the international debt crisis -- easing the debt burden could reverse Africa's economic decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just cancelling interest on the debt would be a significant step, Unicef says, noting that sub-Saharan Africa's combined 1989 interest bill for long-term and IMF debt was $ 7.2 billion, while &quot;all Unicef child-oriented goalsfor sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s could be achieved with an additional $ 7 billion a year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the calls made by the roundtable is for member governments of the IMF to adopt a policy of &quot;zero net transfers&quot; to Africa for at least the next six years.  Between 1986 and 1990, the parliamentarians said, &quot;the IMF has extracted over $ 3 billion&quot; more in debt payments from low-income African countries that it has put into those countries as loans.  The legislators called on the IMF to consider selling a small fraction of its gold reserves and using the proceeds to reduce African debt.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mauritania was scheduled to join the swelling ranks of African countries voting on new constitutions over the weekend, with a referendum on a document that would re-install multiparty politics in the northwest African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed constitution provides for a president elected for a renewable six-year term and includes guarantees of equality, freedom of expression, association and conscience, the right to political opposition and a free press. But protestors, who took to the streets last month, say that a constitution drafted by military rulers, while opposition leaders are detained, is no recipe for democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, concerns continue to be raised about Mauritania's record on human rights. Six weeks ago Africa Watch issued a report on the executions or deaths under torture of more than 200 black Mauritanians. The Mauritanian government is dominated by persons of Moorish descent, and discrimination against blacks has been a common feature of Mauritanian life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Actual slavery was abolished a decade ago, but an Amnesty International report last year called the practice &quot;alive and well.&quot; In its annual report released last week, Amnesty cited Mauritania as still a sad case on a continent where human rights have seen some improvement with the growth of pro-democracy movements in the last year. In a move that observers found significant, the Mauritanian Workers Union issued a call in April for an investigation into the treatment of black detainees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plight of black and dissident Mauritanians has also received some recent attention in the U.S Congress. In joint hearings on June 19 by Mervyn Dymally (D-CA) of the House Subcommittee of Africa and Gus Yatron (D--PA) of the House Subcommittee on Human Rights and International Organizations, witnesses testified that despite its moves towards political pluralism, Mauritania has not halted its practice of gross human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congressional Human Rights Caucus has drafted a letter to Mauritanian ruler Maawiy Ould Sidi Ahmed Taya, urging him &quot;to put an end to slavery and the persecution of individuals on the basis of race.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mauritanian government has argued that the new constitution, which calls Mauritania an &quot;Arab and African Islamic Republic,&quot; and adds there are three languages spoken by black ethnic groups as national languages -- although Arabic remains the official language -- is a giant step towards integrating blacks into the political and economic life of the country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Africa has only 11% of the world's population, two-thirds of the victims of wars over the past decade have been African.  At the height of the conflicts, 25 African children died every hour from the effects of the fighting, according to estimates by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).  An additional 5 million are continuing to struggle for survival amid war-related famine and economic dislocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children are always the foremost victims of wars and natural disasters, and in Africa, where children are nearly half the population, the impact is particularly heavy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique is perhaps the worst-affected country.  Besides the millions of children who have been displaced, orphaned or separated from their families, tens of thousands have been kidnapped by rebels who forced them to witness and participate in acts of brutality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the help of international organizations like Save the Children Fund and Unicef, the Mozambique government has established programs to train counselors to help children cope with their experiences, to trace family members and to place orphans with relatives or other families in their home communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989, Duke University psychologist Neil Boothby and colleagues began a survey of children directly affected by war in Mozambique.  In the following excerpts from a presentation in March, he recounts some of the findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six-year-old Franisse was kidnapped by Renamo, the Mozambique rebel movement while he was down by the river. Hands grabbed him, and he was shoved up the path to his village, where a man gave him matches and made him set his family's hut ablaze. His mother ran out first, then his father. Franisse was made to watch as the bandits, as they are called by many in Mozambique, cut his parents heads off with machetes. Their bodies were dismembered, and the heads impaled on stakes. &quot;This is what Frelimo (the government party) buys you,&quot; he said, as Franisse was marched along with other survivors, back to Renamo's armed stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are tens of thousands of children like Franisse in Mozambique.  Child survivors can be seen staggering into government-run refugee centers physically malnourished and psychologically numbed, sometimes speechless, seemingly incapable of showing any emotion other than a kind of unnerving wait-and-see stoicism. Sometimes they awake from nightmares with somatic complications: headaches, stiff necks, respiratory ailments, or occasionally, the temporary loss of eyesight or hearing. Yet given time and stability, many of these child survivors have been able to make substantial recoveries from the almost unimaginable tragedies they witnessed and experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the children we have worked with in Mozambique is a group of 42 former soldiers between six and 16 years old who were being cared for at the Lhanguene Center. Nearly all the boy soldiers had been abducted by Renamo, trained as combatants, and in many instances, encouraged to kill other human beings. The indoctrination process is a brutal and systematic attempt to transform children into abusers with formal rituals performed following a child's first act of murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clinical observations of the consequences of various kinds of war-associated stresses and traumas indicates that there is a difference between the effects on children exposed to acute trauma and those faced with chronic stress and violence. An acute reaction generally lasts only a few days and is marked by features of severe anxiety. If the trauma is intense enough, it may lead to permanent psychological scarring, especially when children lose their parents, extended family or other familiar community members. The fear and anxiety that most children do manifest appears to subside fairly rapidly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chronic reactions, on the other hand, are those which endure beyond this brief time span. It is marked by features of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including a persistent re-experiencing of the trauma, reduced responsiveness and involvement with the environment, and diminished expectations for the future. Profound alterations in personality, behavior and moral development have also been noted among child victims of chronic political violence. Many children learn to cope or survive in these dangerous circumstances, but their survival is not without cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In our initial experimental treatment for the 42 boys at the Lhanguene Center, we found that the length of time spent in the Renamo base camp, more than direct involvement in violence per se, was associated with their varied abilities to later act upon traditional concepts of right and wrong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, the 35 boys who had spent less than six months in Renamo camps appeared to emerge from these experiences with their sense of basic trust in the traditional tribal values of their communities intact. Even though some had committed acts of violence, they continued to define themselves as victims, rather than as members, of Renamo. After liberation, the majority of these boys did display aggressive behaviors and feelings that were indeed distrustful of adults. However, these behaviors and attitudes subsided quickly, and their early recovery efforts were marked more by symptoms of PTSD -- including appropriate feelings of remorse -- than by antisocial behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the seven boys who had spent between one and two years in Renamo camps appeared to have crossed a kind of identity threshold in which their own self-concepts had become more solidly entwined with their captors. These boys had come to view themselves as members of Renamo. As one 15-year-old boy put it: &quot;I was reborn in that base camp. Even if I could have escaped, I could never have gone home again. Not after what I had seen and done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after three months at the Lhanguene Center did we begin to observe signs of remorse over previous acts of violence among these boys, as well as anxiety connected to reminders of other traumatic events. These symptoms began to occur at about the same time the boys started to show increased attachment behavior and more positive feelings toward their new adult caretakers, a &quot;softening&quot; that was also accompanied by an increased interest in social activities outside the center. This led us to suspect that these symptoms were prompted by their struggle to leave behind a world in which killing was sanctioned, and to re-enter a world in which killing is, once again, condemned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rehabilitation efforts at the center tried to establish daily routines and safe codes of behavior. Oral storytelling, dance, theater or sociodrama and art also emerged as traditional activities most readily adaptable for therapeutic purposes. But the boys' efforts to re-enter civilian life after dehumanizing experiences in Renamo camps were facilitated less through psychological intervention than through members of the Mozambique Women's Organization (OMM) who were the caretakers at the Lhanguene Center. One 52-year-old volunteer told us that the attitudes and behaviors of both boys and caretakers gradually changed over time, from mutual fear to mother/child relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patience and dedication of OMM caretakers enabled most of these boys to reorient various aspects of their mental, emotional, social and moral development. By the end of the first year at the center, all had made substantial progress in school, bearing witness to their basically unharmed capacity for cognitive learning and had learned to control their aggressive behavior towards outsiders. All showed at least the beginnings of more normal relationships with adults and other children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When the boys were reunited with their families or returned to their communities, we continued to follow their progress during the first 18 months of their readjustment. The results revealed a continuation of the same high potential for readaptation. Even those who have been cursed with the worst possible circumstances have been able to manage moments and longer periods of competent behavior, good humor and optimism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What also needs to be stressed is that in Mozambique survival is a collective act, rooted in community compassion and care. In endangered zones, extended families and neighbors employ a number of measures to try to protect their children from Renamo, ranging from hiding children together in forests or caves at night, to caring for one another's children while primary caretakers are away working in potentially dangerous fields, to fleeing together to safer districts, provincial capitals or even to neighboring countries. One of the results of this collective act is that despite the widespread destruction of villages and massive displacements of people, the vast majority of the estimated 200,000 orphaned and unaccompanied children have been absorbed by extended families and members of former communities or ethnic groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An awareness of children's potential adaptability under stress and of protective factors within children's ecologies has important programmatic implications in countries like Mozambique. First it suggests that the major thrust of primary mental health initiatives needs to be oriented towards the source of children's resilience, rather than to the individual child. Broader aid efforts must try to help children re-establish their primary relationships with parents, families and communities. The timely provision of food, material or other cash assistance can help vulnerable families to maintain a regular income and to continue supporting themselves and their children. Parents, teachers and other community members also require assistance in understanding that the child's initial aggressive behavior is often an effort to re-establish limits or boundaries as well as trust in others. In this way the community may be better able to tolerate what can be constructive use of aggression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, we found that former boy soldiers require more than psychological treatment in order to re-enter community life. They need to be forgiven by society, sometimes by the very people who have been victimized by their past actions. Many of our initial efforts on behalf of boy soldiers in Mozambique focused on helping community members -- political leaders, soldiers, police, teachers, and other students -- to understand that these boys themselves were victims as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also worked with the Mozambique government on a national level to establish policy and concrete procedures so that children who were forced to participate with Renamo would be provided appropriate care and psychological treatment rather than be sent to military prisons. Community cohesion, family care and psychocultural support services are all playing a role in children's recoveries. But is has been Mozambique's policy of amnesty -- a policy which institutionalizes forgiveness rather than institutionalizing children -- that has provided at least some of these boy soldiers the opportunity to return home to their families and friends.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six out of every ten Africans are children -- a fact that has prompted African countries to take particular notice of children's issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African governments were among the first to give their collective backing to the 1990 World Summit for Children sponsored by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef).  The Organization of African Unity responded to the summit's call for action by drawing up an African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and declaring the 1990s the &quot;African Decade for Child Survival, Protection and Development.&quot; On June 16, countries across the continent observed the &quot;Day of the African Child&quot; by hanging banners, producing media programs and organizing special events to highlight children's needs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spurring all the attention is the grim reality that 29 of the world's 42 least developed countries are in Africa.  Of the 30 countries in the world with an infant mortality rate greater than 100 for each 1,000 live births, 23 are in sub-Saharan Africa.  The life expectancy of Africa's children is 20 years less than that of children in industrialized countries.  During 1991, 4.7 million African children will die, mostly from preventable diseases.  The spread of AIDS poses a further threat: already, one of every 10 AIDS patients in east and central Africa is a child under five years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the prospects for Africa's children are not unremittingly bleak.  In the last decade, North African countries have achieved nearly 80% vaccination rates against the six main child killer diseases, while the rate for sub-Saharan Africa has risen from 20% to almost 60%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Grant, Executive Director of Unicef, argues that Africa's gains are impressive, when measured against the starting point at independence.  &quot;It has taken Africa just three decades,&quot; he says, &quot;to raise health, literacy and other standards to levels which industrialized civilizations took more than a century to achieve.&quot; Since the 1960s, the mortality rate for African children under five has dropped by 42%, while average life expectancy has risen from 41 to 53 years.  Five out of every six children born in Africa in 1991 will survive their first five, most vulnerable years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, the lives saved through immunization programs and other advances in health and nutrition will diminish the population pressures that have contributed to the continent's declining per capita income in recent years. Around the world, population growth rates begin to fall only after survival rates rise, when parents have more assurances that the children they bear will live.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The various recent conferences and declarations devoted to children have sparked a number of responses in industrialized countries, including a fact-finding trip to Africa earlier this year by the administrator of the U.S.  Agency for International Development, Ronald W. Roskens and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.  The trip fulfilled a pledge made by President George Bush in a September 30 address to the U.N. children's summit, when he said he would dispatch a presidential mission to Africa &quot;to see what else America and the world can do to advance child survival across that continent and around the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the policy recommendations arising from the team's visit to eight countries are: a commitment to broad-based economic growth; an emphasis on support for primary and preventive health care; backing for programs that encourage behavioral change to fight the transmission of AIDS; intensified assistance for family planning; the sharing of information technology with African professionals; the building of stronger institutional links between Africans and Americans; and increased attention to malaria, which the trip report calls &quot;the forgotten killer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, malaria accounts for 20-30% of Africa's under-five childhood deaths.  But there is new hope for curbing the disease's devastating impact.  Recently published results of research trials in West Africa show that low-cost bed nets, permeated with insecticides, could dramatically reduce the incidence of malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are many efforts underway to provide better health care and educational opportunities, to limit population growth, and to increase family incomes.  But there is widespread agreement among child welfare workers that two major factors hinder the ability of those efforts to improve the lot of Africa's children.  One is the number of armed conflicts across the continent (see story, pages 6 and 7); the other is the debt burden that continues to retard economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite those harsh realities, there appears to be a growing sense among African researchers and social scientists that hard lessons have been learned over the last three decades and that the 1990s will see the fruits of more informed development policies.  &quot;You may have to come and spend some time in the countries of Africa to see some of the positive changes,&quot; says Ivorian political economist Dr. Joseph Yao Yao.  Statistics may be discouraging, he says--and they are important--but they hide the strength of Africa's human resources.  The importance of &quot;investing in human capital,&quot; especially in the welfare of children, is one of the lessons that must be heeded, he says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both the Sudanese government of Omar Hassan al-Bashir and the insurgent Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) have accepted Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida -- who currently chairs the Organization of African Unity -- as mediator in the civil war that has wracked Sudan since 1983. An early cease-fire agreement would not only suspend the fighting, but would improve the prospects of getting emergency aid to an estimated 8 million people facing starvation in Sudan's isolated southern region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the potential benefits of peace have failed to spark any visible progress towards negotiations. Nor have the two sides been able to stir much international interest in a conflict that remains murky to most outsiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling military junta seized power in a 1989 coup, from a government that Los Angeles Times reporter Michael Hiltzik called &quot;a democracy -- if a wretched one -- so blind to the needs of its people that it fell entirely unlamented.&quot; The new regime of Islamic fundamentalists imposed Sharia, or Islamic law, in the predominantly-Moslem northern region, including the capital, Khartoum. Hundreds of potential dissidents were arrested, including teachers, doctors, lawyers and trade unionists. The human rights group Africa Watch said that in Sudanese detention centers &quot;torture is practiced on a systematic basis.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel SPLM, led by John Garang, celebrated the eighth anniversary of its military wing two months ago, and the group says it now controls 300,000 square miles of southern Sudan, an area with a predominantly Christian population. But the SPLM suffered a setback with the fall of the Mengistu regime in neighboring Ethiopia, which had backed the rebels. As many as 400,000 Sudanese, who had gone to Ethiopia to escape the fighting, fled back across the border where their new refugee camps have been bombed by Sudan's air force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang, interviewed while visiting Washington late last month, says the SPLM is &quot;eager to negotiate a just resolution to the conflict&quot; and is &quot;prepared to sit down any time.&quot; But he says his group remains wary because &quot;there have been many peace initiatives before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Garang doubts the government's commitment to end the fighting. The present government in Khartoum, he says, is the fourth one that the SPLM has confronted, and &quot;it is getting more fundamentalist and more intransigent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A state department official who doesn't want to speak on the record says he doubts the SPLM's own commitment to finding an end to the conflict.  &quot;Neither side has shown any willingness to give,&quot; says the official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Garang says that the SPLM would attend talks &quot;with an open mind and no preconditions.&quot; However, Garang's contention that the al-Bashir government &quot;has no legitimacy to give us&quot; is a thinly veiled challenge to the government's own legitimacy.  So is Garang's reference to al-Bashir's junta, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), as &quot;junior rebels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang's concept of talks, at which the &quot;senior rebels&quot; of the SPLM would &quot;brainstorm&quot; with the RCC and a number of northern groupings that oppose it, is likely to be rejected by the government. And the RCC, for its part, draws its main support from radical Islamic forces and is unlikely to yield on the key question of Sharia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the issues that divide the two sides concern the identity and administration of the state, Sharia has been a touchstone of the war. Its introduction in 1983 by then-President Jaafar Nimeiry weighed heavily among the factors that caused the non-Islamic southerners to take up arms, and Sharia was suspended after Nimeiry's ouster in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talks mediated by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter in December 1989 broke down when the al-Bashir government and the SPLM were unable to resolve the issue. The RCC's exemption of the south when it formally imposed Sharia early this year did not appease the SPLM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the SPLM raises questions about Sudan's identity as an Arab-African state. Dominated by the Arab-identified north since its independence in 1955, Sudan is a member of the Arab League and the Islamic Conference Organization. The people of the south, where the SPLM draws its main support, are Christians and followers of traditional African faiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are all questions which must be included in negotiations,&quot; says John Garang. He vehemently rejects the suggestion that Sudan might fare better as two nations, saying the SPLM &quot;will fight for the unity of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unified Sudan envisioned by Garang is one in which the south enjoys some autonomy, and where economic power is not a monopoly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fundamental element of the power equation has been control of natural resources. The SPLM now appears eager to sidestep this issue by luring back the foreign investors who fled the fighting between its own army and government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are ready now to cooperate with international business,&quot; Garang says. The development of the south's oil, gold, tea and coffee sectors &quot;all can start now,&quot; he promises. &quot;Whatever scenario we end up with, Sudan is so big that it cannot be administered from the center and there will need to be a devolution of power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang termed his group's opening to investors &quot;parallel development,&quot; much like the &quot;parallel aid programs&quot; that have sometimes been a necessity for delivering food aid to famine victims in areas controlled by the SPLM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what guarantees of security foreign investors might expect when relief workers in the area have complained of harassment by the SPLM -- as well as by the RCC in the areas the government controls, Garang replied that corporations should use as a barometer the &quot;freedom movement&quot; that non-governmental organizations experience in SPLM territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's crazy,&quot; says the state department official, of the appeal to investors. The most attractive oil deposits are all in contested territory, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the contest, which has cost at least 300,000 lives, seems likely to continue in the immediate future. Although the fall of the Ethiopian government has deprived the SPLM of a valuable base for operations and lines of resupply, Garang claims that the change has had no military impact, since the rebels already control most of the south's territory. However, the government remains firmly ensconced in the major garrison towns of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya is the most logical supply channel currently available to the SPLM, although Garang insists that it would be impossible to bring anything but humanitarian aid through that &quot;open society.&quot; Garang also categorically denies persistent reports that Israel is providing military aid to the SPLM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there has been speculation that the U.S. has quietly supported the SPLM, the state department denies backing either side. John Garang refuses to divulge details about his discussions with Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Herman Cohen, except to say that it concerned relief for the south and Cohen's ideas for pursuing a peaceful settlement of the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RCC is in an equally tight squeeze. Its support of Iraq during the Gulf crisis alienated the Gulf states -- which cut off shipments of free and cheap oil -- as well as angered Egypt and western governments. Already exasperated by the junta's refusal to admit that Sudan faced a famine of epic proportions and by its human rights abuses, the U.S. and Britain withdrew most of their embassy personnel shortly before beginning the war against Iraq in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. personnel returned in April, but the Bush administration suspended Sudan's trading privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences. Since then the administration has focused on the delivery of famine relief -- which is of little direct benefit to the government whose economic problems have become catastrophic. Demonstrators underlined the crisis by taking to the streets in May, when the government attempted a quick-fix currency exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya has helped with oil shipments and is trying to repair Khartoum's rift with Egypt. The Libyan government has also signed a political unity agreement with Sudan. But the state department official dismisses the pact as rhetoric, arguing that even Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi, whose foreign policy has consistently called for Arab integration, is not terribly interested in the deteriorating, seemingly hopeless nation that Sudan has become.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lome -- A quarter century of dictatorship in Togo is coming to a methodical end, after months of strikes and demonstrations that forced the government of President Gnassingbe Eyadema to agree to democratic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a process that parallels the march towards political pluralism in more than a dozen African countries during recent months, representatives of political parties and civic and professional organizations are meeting in Lome, the Togolese capital, to choose a transitional government. Topping the agenda for the nearly 900 delegates to the national conference is the selection of a prime minister and the adoption of a multi-party constitution and a timetable for free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the conference on July 8, Eyadema said Togo is entering &quot;a new era&quot; that will usher in fundamental change. &quot;We must prepare ourselves to manage this democratic opening with wisdom, tolerance, and especially calm and peace,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's rousing opening session, where the singing of Togo's national anthem seemed to shake the conference hall, was a victory for the sustained campaign of defiance that had brought normal life in Lome and several other cities to a standstill and left several dozen people dead in clashes with security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference proceedings are being broadcast nationally on radio and television -- an opposition demand that the government eventually accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the meeting got underway, deep divisions quickly surfaced with delegates debating organizational details and accreditation. On Wednesday, proceedings were temporarily suspended after one opposition figure, Andoch Bonin, a former Eyadema aide recently returned from exile, was detained by troops. He was released two hours later following a protest march on the conference center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Togolese military, which has been allocated 16 seats at the conference but has not sent any representatives, is reacting warily to the wave of change. Late last month, soldiers staged a one-day protest which included occupation of the national radio stations to underline grievances over pay. And there are signs that lower-ranking troops are more sympathetic to the opposition than senior officers, who enjoy Eyadema's patronage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the president agreed to the conference in principle more than a month ago, the meeting was postponed several times when disagreements arose between government and opposition negotiators. Most serious was Eyadema's initial insistence that national conference decisions be advisory rather than binding and that he stay on as president. After a renewed series of street protests, Eyadema agreed to a compromise that will allow him to serve out his term in office during the transition period but will vest executive power in the hands of the new prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another important concession won by the opposition was the democratic election of conference participants from around the country. &quot;We really insisted that the government's idea of appointing the delegates was not acceptable,&quot; said Messan Gnininvi, head of the coalition of political parties which worked out logistics for the meeting with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyadema has ruled since a 1967 coup that was his second intervention in the affairs of state. In 1964 as an army sergeant, he staged post-independent Africa's first military takeover, in which then-President Sylvanus Olympio was killed -- reportedly by Eyadema himself. The coup leaders handed over the government to opposition leader Nicolas Grunitzky, who served until Eyadema seized control four years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition figures are not reconciled to the agreement that Eyadema could stay on as president. &quot;This government has no legitimacy,&quot; said Gilchrist Olympio, son of the slain president who returned to Togo last week after 25 years in exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Gnininvi says the opposition's acceptance of Eyadema's continuation in office was a necessary compromise. &quot;It was not easy to get him to agree to the conference and we had to offer something to convince him to cooperate,&quot; Gnininvi says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most Togolese do want Eyadema to resign now, says Nicholas M. Lawson, a newspaper publisher who is spokesman for the opposition coalition. &quot;It is difficult for us to defend the compromise we made, but it is the responsible thing to do,&quot; he says. &quot;We have to start learning that in a democracy when you don't like a president you don't just oust him by demonstrations or coups d'etat, you wait for elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the mood in Lome, the seaside capital, is not one of waiting.  Dusty during dry spells, Lome's dirt streets have become clogged with mud in the heavy downpours of this rainy season. As residents wade through the often ankle-deep water in downtown thoroughfares, they complain that Eyadema has stolen what wealth the country has produced during his rule. &quot;After 25 years of a government that has done nothing for the people, the situation is catastrophic,&quot; says Josepha Afa Pocanam-Dosseh, a national conference delegate and secretary-general of the Togolese Women's Association for Democracy and Development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, only three months old, is one of four organizations formed after women political activists were told that only formal organizations could participate in planning the national conference. &quot;Women were excluded from the preparations,&quot; Pocanam-Dosseh says. &quot;If we hadn't created these associations, women wouldn't be represented at all.&quot; The Women's Association's chief goal is a reformed educational system, including free and compulsory primary schools.  &quot;A generation of our children has been sacrificed,&quot; says Poconam-Dosseh. But she is optimistic about the future. &quot;Our true independence begins now,&quot; she says. &quot;We will educate our children, our mothers and our sisters and we will make our fathers and our brothers understand that education for everyone is fundamental to democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney Diyanama Ywassa agrees that &quot;profound change&quot; is coming to Togo and she welcomes it. But at the same time, she worries about the high expectations the national conference has generated. &quot;I fear that many people think democracy is a magic word, that with democracy everything is going to change,&quot; she says. &quot;The long march to democracy is punctuated with difficulties.&quot;</SPAN></P>

But continuing partition of the country meant that there were two separate official ceremonies, one in the capital Monrovia and the other in Gbarnga, headquarters of the National Patriotic Front headed by Charles Taylor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A West African peacekeeping force based in Monrovia maintains a cease-fire, and last month an agreement was reached for the holding of elections under West African supervision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the ceasefire holding, many of the nearly one million Liberians forced to flee the country are seeking to return home. The interim government in Monrovia has recently arranged repatriation for over 40,000 refugees from Sierre Leone. Last week, an interim government official, James Holder, visited Cote d'Ivoire -- home to an estimated 320,000 Liberians -- to discuss repatriation with refugees there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Democracy movements may have sprouted all over the African continent, but few can rival the inventiveness of Madagascar's opposition coalition, Force Vive (Living Force). Last Tuesday, when the government announced a 15-day curfew and state of emergency that banned all meetings and rallies, 300,000 Force Vive supporters gathered in the main square of the capital, Antananarivo, for what they called &quot;an all-night street ball.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite heavy security at government buildings, the opposition was able to install its own leaders in seven government ministries. The shadow ministers were part of a 12-person cabinet named by Force Vive as a transition government, in defiance of President Didier Ratsiraka's refusal to step down or to call a national conference. At least two members of the opposition shadow cabinet were arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The daily public protests, which began on June 10, have been largely peaceful and marked by restraint on both sides. Last week, troops outside the finance ministry stood at attention as opposition leader Jean Rakotoharison arrived at the head of a Force Vive delegation. The Reuter news agency quoted witnesses saying that when Rakotoharison, a popular retired general, ordered armored vehicles guarding the ministry to withdraw, they obeyed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there were also violent clashes last week that raised fears of more trouble ahead for the Indian Ocean island, unless the president agrees to opposition demands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During his 26 years in power, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has often outflanked his opponents by appointing his harshest critics to high government positions. Last week he tried to do it again.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his naming of a leading opposition figure as prime minister seems to have backfired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement of the appointment of Etienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), brought thousands of protestors to the streets in front of Tshisekedi's house shouting, &quot;We refuse, we refuse!&quot; After meeting with the opposition coalition, the UDPS chief said he was turning down the prime ministership. &quot;We will not be lured by the charm of power,&quot; he said. Justine Kasavubu, spokesperson for the UDPS in Brussels, told the BBC that the appointment had been &quot;a maneuver by Mobutu to split the opposition.&quot; And in the face of obvious public anger at the announcement of his appointment, Tshisekedi was careful to distance himself from the president's decision. &quot;I was surprised,&quot; he told 2,000 people who gathered outside his party headquarters. &quot;I never listen to Mobutu's radio or watch his television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu has been under increasing pressure from a pro-democracy movement, and on July 19 he agreed to give limited powers to a national conference on Zaire's political future, scheduled to convene at the end of the month.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> West Africa's largest nation, Niger, is scheduled to begin its national conference this week after months of wrangling between government and opposition forces over the shape of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Niger has not experienced the violent upheaval that has occurred in Togo, Cameroon, and next-door-neighbor Mali, the process of change has been no less dramatic. The government has faced steadily mounting pressure to democratize, including several major marches by women, a rarity in the Moslem world. Chris McCarus reports on the mood in the Niger capital during the period leading up to the conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niamey -- When President Ali Saibou announced last November that a national conference would take place in May, prospects seemed good for a smooth transition to multiparty democracy after 17 years of military-led rule. But progress towards a workable design has proved difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks that followed, opposition parties sprouted, unions flexed their muscles, and women took to the street demanding a greater role in the planning process and equitable representation at the meeting. The starting date was repeatedly postponed while a 75-member preparatory committee struggled to reach agreement on arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the heavily-Muslim country, the public appearance of women in large numbers was particularly astonishing. The first women's march, several thousand-strong, took place on May 13 -- two weeks before the then-scheduled opening of the conference. Carrying banners reading &quot;Stop Injustice&quot; and &quot;Equal Rights,&quot; the protesters paraded from the national assembly to the prime minister's office in the center of the capital. Early this month, women marched again, after the conference starting date was postponed once more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until the rains arrived a few weeks ago, Niamey was hot and dusty. The Niger River flowing through the capital provides humidity, even in the dry season, and offers a hospitable home for mosquitoes and flies. Amid the brown that dominates the landscape, signs of modernity are sprinkled -- hotels, bank buildings, and the large Kennedy Bridge -- financed by revenues from the country's leading export earner, uranium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But uranium has been unable to lift Niger from the ranks of the poorest nations on earth. With a population of seven million and an average income of only $ 290 a year, the country's economy has stagnated. Recurring drought and a decade of depressed uranium prices have caused a net decline in living standards in the past 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The promise of democracy has raised hopes for better things to come.  But the work of the conference preparatory committee has been hampered by distrust between the government officials on one side and the representatives of labor unions, student associations and 18 political parties on the other. As the negotiations dragged on and the conference opening was postponed again and again, suspicions deepened that Saibou was maneuvering to retain power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiek Diop, publisher of Haske, Niger's only independent newspaper, said he feared that the delays and the contention could provide an excuse for the army to intervene &quot;and thus scrap the whole conference on grounds of national security.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference agenda also remains a delicate issue. Opposition representatives have made clear their intention to raise questions that could embarrass Ali Saibou, an army chief who became head of state in 1987, after the death of Niger's former ruler, Major-General Seyni Kountche.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One preparatory committee document refers to &quot;the political, social, economic and cultural crimes&quot; that will be discussed at the conference.  Professor Ali Salifou, a member of one opposition group, said he expects conference delegates to remove all but ceremonial authority from the head of state. &quot;We are going to attend a national conference that is nothing less than a civilian coup d'etat,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That may be just what the government is trying to avoid with its many procedural objections to conference plans. &quot;What right does this preparatory committee have,&quot; asked Communications Minister Khamed Abdoullayehave, &quot;to remove the president from power?&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abuja, Nigeria -- Sam Bede knew what he wanted when he made the 400-mile journey early this year north from Owerri, capital of Imo state in southern Nigeria. Having heard from his older sister that there were job opportunities in this newly built federal capital, the 22-year-old high school graduate came searching for work to enable him to pursue his ambition of an accountant's degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bede says the collapse of a once-thriving oil economy has dealt a &quot;big blow&quot; to Nigerians.  &quot;It is very difficult to afford schooling,&quot; he says, &quot;unless you are quite wealthy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father, a farmer, has no money for his children's higher education. Although from an oil producing area, Bede believes Nigeria's leaders have pursued unsound development policies. &quot;Agriculture, our major product, has been forgotten, and that has led to our economic downfall,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food costs have skyrocketed, as have most other prices, following a ten-fold devaluation of the Nigerian currency, the naira. Housing is expensive and in short supply in most areas, including Abuja. &quot;We have money in this country, but it is in a few people's hands,&quot; Bede says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Average income in Nigeria plummeted in the past decade, along with the price of oil. From a peak in 1980, oil revenue fell from $ 25 billion to $6.6 billion in just six years. Last year saw the first increase, as a result of the petroleum price rises sparked by the Gulf war. But income levels remain 30% lower than they were 10 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of this year, President Ibrahim Babangida warned Nigerians against believing that a &quot;windfall&quot; from oil price hikes would stimulate &quot;a second generation oil boom.&quot; Much of the extra income from rising prices has been gobbled up to service the country's foreign debt, which now totals about $ 35 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, government officials say they are optimistic that the nose-dive of the past decade has been reversed. A debt-rescheduling agreement with creditors has been worked out, and the International Monetary Fund has agreed to a $ 620 million loan. &quot;There is now widespread confidence in our economy and in the process of political stabilization and democratization that is underway,&quot; says Dr. Tunji Olagunju, minister of state for special duties and a Babangida confidant. &quot;We expect to experience an economic boom in the early 1990s,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, Sam Bede's prospects have improved. Although unemployment among young job-seekers is said to be running at 60%, Bede now has a steady job at the Sheraton Hotel in Abuja, earning the minimum wage of about $ 25 a month. By living with his sister's family, he thinks he can save enough money to enter university next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless there are major meetings in Abuja like the recent summits of the Organization of African Unity and the Economic Community of West Africa States (Ecowas), the Sheraton and the two other major hotels are rarely filled. Still, Bede believes his job is secure. He hopes to get a spot on the night shift, so he can work and go to school at the same time when classes begin this fall at the new university here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abuja is still a capital-in-the-making -- a project Babangida has committed himself to completing, along with the transition to civilian rule and the economic recovery program, during what he has called &quot;the twilight&quot; of his tenure. A large mosque nearing completion in the center of town dominates the landscape. Four-lane highways connect the large hotels to a huge conference center complex, while shops are spread among several housing areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although some government ministries have moved their operations from Lagos, many buildings remain unfinished, and few embassies have even started construction. Local officials say the pace will quicken later this year, if Babangida transfers the presidency to Abuja, as he has pledged to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We weren't sure the president would ever really move here,&quot; says Theophilus Okodo, an odd-jobs man who was attracted to the city two years ago by the prospect of work. &quot;But now it seems he is coming.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 49-year-old president, who came to power in 1985, also has surprised skeptics with his intention to keep to a timetable for handing over power. After banning all the old political parties and establishing two new ones -- the National Republicans and the Social Democrats -- the government conducted local elections last December which generally won high marks for fairness, though turnout was light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have succeeded in creating national political parties for the first time,&quot; says Dr. Jerry Gana, chairman of the directorate for social mobilization, an agency set up by the government to coordinate the transition and educate the public about the process. &quot;They are not ethnic, they are not religiously based, they are not regionally based,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an effort to avoid the failures of past civilian governments, which became notorious for their extreme corruption and levels of incompetence, the government has banned all former politicians from standing for office in the round of voting that includes state elections later this year and a presidential poll in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ray Ekpu, editor of Newswatch, the country's largest-circulation news weekly, says the success to date of the electoral scheme has proved skeptics wrong. But he is concerned about the government's &quot;excessive intervention&quot; in the process. &quot;I think the politicians should be given more leeway,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gana argues that the effort to break with the past is proving successful. &quot;In every rural area, people now know what is happening, they know the power relations in their community, they know the power of their vote,&quot; he says. &quot;We've never had that before in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the real yardstick by which the military government is likely to be measured is economic. Spiraling population growth, high inflation, and the persistence of rampant corruption threaten to tarnish whatever stability is gained from an orderly election process.  &quot;Democracy is very expensive, so we need a solid and growing economy if democracy is to be sustained,&quot; Gana concedes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, like many Nigerians, Sam Bede maintains a firm faith that political change will affect his own and the nation's pocketbook. &quot;If we have a democratic system of government it will improve our economic standard,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">400 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soumana Sacko said he was &quot;surprised&quot; when he got a call late last March from Mali's new ruling military and civilian council asking him to head a transitional government during the changeover to elected rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have plenty of very able men and women who could have done this job,&quot; the 40-year-old prime minister said in an interview with Africa News. The summons reached him in Bangui, Central African Republic, where Sacko was principal economist in the regional office of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). He thinks he was chosen because he was a known entity, both internationally and at home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former journalist who received a masters degree in public management and a Ph.D in economics from the University of Pittsburgh, Sacko has spent most of his career in government service. He made a name for himself in 1987, during a brief tenure as Mali's finance minister. After only six months in office, he was forced to resign when his anti-corruption campaign veered too close to dealings by President Moussa Traore and his wife Mariam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacko said he enjoys good relations with head-of-state Amadou Toiumani Toure, the army lieutenant colonel who staged the March 26 coup that ousted Traore from office. The prime minister works closely with the 10 soldiers as well as the 15 civilians on the transitional committee that governs the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacko said his preoccupation is the economy. He defends the austerity measures his government has adopted as essential to &quot;correct past mistakes&quot; and reverse the country's decline. &quot;These are not imposed from outside,&quot; he insisted, but are homemade prescriptions for a country on the economic brink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacko sees economic integration in Africa -- and the plans recently endorsed by the Organization of African Unity for an African common market -- as an important step towards growth and development, although he thinks &quot;more backward&quot; countries like Mali stand to gain less at the outset than their wealthier neighbors. &quot;We have to move beyond micro-states which have small markets where production cannot be economic,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prime minister is enthusiastic about the political dialogue that followed the Traore ouster and culminates this week in the national conference. &quot;We have the whole spectrum of political ideas represented,&quot; he said. &quot;So much the better for democracy, so much the better for Mali.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Four months after a coup that ended 22 years of military dictatorship, Mali is holding a national conference to hammer out a program for a democratic future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As in more than a dozen African countries experiencing dramatic political changes, accountable government has become the slogan for the landlocked nation that is nearly twice the size of Texas. But events in Mali took a different turn from those in the other countries where national conferences have become the mechanism for a transfer from totalitarianism to multiparty rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, the calls for national conferences have been voiced by government opponents, buttressed by street demonstrations and strikes, and opposed -- often violently -- by troops and security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali decisively broke that pattern on March 26, when soldiers ordered to crush the protests turned their guns on the man who gave the orders. A group of army officers -- who said they had sickened of the attacks on demonstrators that had killed more than 200 people -- led the ouster of long-serving dictator Moussa Traore and replaced him with a transitional administration of military men and respected civilian leaders.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soumana Sacko, a University of Pittsburgh-trained economist, was appointed interim prime minister, and coup leader Lt.-Col. Amadou Toiumani Toure promised national elections by January. Unlike the regimes that have opposed or stalled national conferences until forced to yield by widespread protests, the Sacko administration has fully supported the preparations for this week's meeting and is expected to establish a precise timetable for municipal, parliamentary and presidential elections. Economic issues will also be discussed, since the country's financial difficulties pose the major hurdle to success for both the current administration and its elected successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, Prime Minister Sacko called the economic legacy of the Traore regime &quot;disastrous.&quot; He said university graduates are unable to find work and the government is being forced &quot;to lay off workers in the public enterprises that are running losses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Sacko visited Washington and New York, seeking support for his economic reform program from the U.S. government, the United Nations, and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a per capita income of about $ 270 per year, Mali has long been among the world's poorest nations. Nearly all of the country's eight million people are peasant farmers or cattle herders. Over 80% are illiterate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks ago, the new government survived a potential fiasco when an alleged coup attempt was thwarted and the accused leaders arrested. In a radio broadcast, Lt.-Col. Toure said the overthrow effort had been led by Major Lamine Diabira, a senior military officer and minister in the transitional government, who was arrested along with eight other officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As news of the attempted takeover was announced on July 15, thousands of people flooded the streets of Bamako, the capital, to show support for the transitional administration, according to reports by Reuters and Agence France Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denying rumors that deposed-president Traore had fled the country, Toure announced that the former leader, his wife and key functionaries of the old regime are still being held in detention. The government has launched an investigation into their handling of the economy, their private finances and their responsibility for the killings that took place during the street demonstrations in January and March. The interim leaders have promised a fair trial for anyone indicted for the alleged offenses, as well as release for those not charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As democracy fervor has gripped Africa, there has been some worry among international and financial circles that new governments will abandon unpopular austerity programs. During his visit to Washington last week, Sacko buttressed his appeal for new assistance by repeating assurances that Mali is committed to the painful economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Launched in 1985, the Mali reform program was designed to dismantle the highly centralized economic structure the country has had since independence in 1960 and to improve the climate for private sector investment.  Regulatory requirements have been eased, price controls removed, and taxes and duties reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reforms have produced modest, but not inconsequential benefits,&quot; says an evaluation report by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), which provided $ 18 million in aid to get the effort underway while negotiations with the World Bank and IMF were stalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American assistance helped make &quot;the bitter pill sweeter,&quot; says the report, which was written before the recent political changes. Mali's &quot;real challenge,&quot; the report says, is to evaluate realistically the resources available -- both domestically and from donors -- and to &quot;allocate them in a way that will best improve the well-being of the people of Mali.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the strikes and protests early this year, across-the-board pay hikes of 50% were demanded by the National Union of Malian Workers, the country's large central labor group, which played a key role in the opposition movement. The transitional government postponed action on that demand until this month. But hours after the July 15 coup attempt was foiled, Sacko announced a pay hike for members of the armed forces and security services and for civil servants. The government said the increase would boost earnings more than 50% for lower-paid ranks, without overspending the current budget's allotment for public sector salaries through 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Sacko said in the interview, all segments of Malian society accept that financial sacrifices are &quot;just a necessity of life,&quot; and that the economic crisis demands belt-tightening. He said the entire transitional leadership, including trade union officials, reiterated their support for the reform program to World Bank and IMF delegations who visited Mali soon after the government changed hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interim government's economic program aims to &quot;concentrate scarce public resources on the social sector,&quot; Sacko said. &quot;The country must 'rely heavily' on the private sector -- local and foreign -- to manage productive areas of the economy and to fuel growth,&quot; the prime minister said. &quot;We have good potential for both mining and agriculture, and we hope private investors will be interested in playing a big role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With outside help, Mali is also trying to resolve another troubling problem -- the continuing conflict between security forces and the nomadic Touareg people in the north of the country. Earlier this month, Lt. Col. Toure broadcast an appeal to &quot;brother nomads&quot; for a cessation of attacks against inhabited encampments, development projects, and transportation links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict is rooted in a long-simmering animosity between Mali's government and the nomads, who complained that they had been excluded from economic benefits enjoyed by other groups in society, while being subjected to government regulations that threatened their traditional way of life as well as their ability to roam across national frontiers. They accused the Traore regime of widespread violence and discrimination against nomadic peoples.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government has endorsed a cease-fire accord, brokered by Algeria, that was signed by the Traore regime and Touareg leaders last January. But one group of nomads has continued fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacko's administration is exploring a regional solution to the hostilities. &quot;The same Touareg are launching armed attacks against Niger, Algeria and Mauritania,&quot; the prime minister said. &quot;We want to put into place some development activities along our common borders.&quot; Sacko said a peace plan that is essentially economic could appeal to people &quot;who may feel that they have been forgotten and left out of the development process.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannesburg's feisty independent newspaper, the Weekly Mail, was the journal that dropped a bombshell on the South Africa government when it revealed the results of an investigation into secret government support for the Inkatha Freedom Party -- a party rival of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC). Clashes between supporters of the groups have killed thousands of people, and the ANC has long charged government complicity in the violence.  Here we reprint the story by Eddie Koch and Weekly Mail co-editor Anton Harber that ignited the furor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The South African Police have paid large amounts of money to help Inkatha oppose the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weekly Mail has also obtained copies of internal security police documents showing extensive discussions between Inkatha president Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and a senior Durban security policeman about ways of preventing the ANC from eroding Inkatha's support in Natal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least R250,000 ($ 87,000) was paid into an Inkatha bank account by the security police for the purpose of organizing rallies and other anti-ANC activities shortly after the release from prison of ANC president Nelson Mandela. One rally paid for by the SAP, at King's Park, Durban on March 25, 1990, was the spark for an upsurge in civic violence that has been known as the Maritzburg War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a top-secret security police memorandum, Buthelezi was very emotional and expressed extreme gratitude for the financial assistance provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents reveal that Buthelezi was concerned about declining membership figures in Natal at the time of Mandela's release from prison and had serious misgivings about the support of some of Inkatha's key leaders, including Inkatha chairman Frank Mdlalose and former secretary general Oscar Dhlomo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weekly Mail has receipts, First National Bank deposit slips, and internal security police memoranda marked &quot;Top Secret/Uiters Geheim&quot;, which confirm the police payments to Inkatha as well as face-to face meetings between Buthelezi, some of his cabinet ministers, and Major Louis Botha, senior officer in the Durban regional security police, to discuss how to deal with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a 10-page memorandum to the chief of security police in Pretoria, dated February 13, 1990 (number S7/28/3/8/4n), Botha asks for R120,000 ($ 42,000) because it was of &quot;cardinal importance&quot; that arrangements were made for a massive turnout at an Inkatha rally &quot;to show everyone that he (Buthelezi) has a strong base&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is recommended that a clandestine grant of at least R120,000 ($ 42,000) be made available for this purpose,&quot; Botha wrote to his superiors.  &quot;It should also be accepted that Inkatha does not have the financial means to arrange such a gathering on its own. The consequences of this rally failing will have far-reaching implications for Buthelezi and the RSA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further letters and receipts show that this payment was made in hard cash into an account in the name of Inkatha/Kgare (Kgare is the organization's Sotho name) at First National Bank in Durban on March 15, 10 days before the rally. The account number was 221426-8006961533.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The security branch of the police has since been disbanded but it is widely believed that its officers are still deployed for covert political operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weekly Mail also has confirmation of a payment of R100,000 ($ 35,000) to Inkatha to organize another rally on November 5, 1989. The rally was in fact held on November 19 and was addressed by King Goodwill Zwelithini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This document, a letter from Brigadier J.A. Steyn, deputy regional chief of the security police in Natal, to the commanding officer of the security police in Pretoria, says that Buthelezi and his justice minister, Jeffrey Mtetwa, asked that their &quot;thanks and great appreciation be passed on to those responsible for passing on the funds.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chief Minister Buthelezi was very emotional when a copy of the receipt was given to him. He could not say thank you enough and said that he had not expected it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weekly Mail, working in conjunction with The Guardian of London, has run extensive checks on the documents. It has confirmed the Inkatha bank account numbers, the identities, addresses and telephone numbers of all those named in them, and the details of the Durban rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no conclusive evidence that Buthelezi or members of Inkatha knew that the money deposited into their account came directly from the security police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha is well-known in Durban as a security policeman with close links to Inkatha and at the time of the documentation was often seen in Buthelezi's company. In the words of one source, &quot;wherever Buthelezi was, Botha was.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is believed that he was for some time involved with Buthelezi's personal security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question of police support for Inkatha was raised in parliament earlier this year by the Democratic Party's Kobus Jordan. He asked whether any section of the intelligence service or the SAP had given financial or organizational support to groups such as Inkatha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President F. W. de Klerk and Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok refused to answer as this would &quot;defeat the legal protection of security information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha's 10-page memorandum motivating the payment to Inkatha gives a rare insight into how the security police see Inkatha as the only organization capable of countering the influence of the ANC. He refers to discussions with Buthelezi over a two-to-three week period and previous security police reports on &quot;Conflict within Inkatha following peace talks&quot; and &quot;Strategic perspectives: Chief Minister Buthelezi and Inkatha: Implications for current negotiations politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha argues that the police should support Inkatha because Buthelezi, under pressure from some of his ministers because of falling support, would otherwise be forced to join forces with the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During our discussion it became very clear that the actions and political maneuvers of the ANC were a matter of concern to the chief minister, especially if one considers the shrinking Inkatha membership figures,&quot; Botha said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Buthelezi had hoped that he would win support after arranging the return to the country of Pan Africanist Congress veteran Prince Velekhaya Shange (described only as &quot;Prins Shange&quot;) and ANC veteran Dr. Wilson Chonco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is also clear that he is very suspicious of overtures from the ANC which according to him would make it easy for the ANC hierarchy to destroy him if he and Inkatha joined the ANC. . ..&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He is also worried about the possible role of his supporters and cabinet members, namely Dr. O. Dlomo (sic), minister of education, Dr. F.  Mdlalose, minister of health, Chief Gumede, minister of public works and Minister S. Sithebe, minister of home affairs,&quot; Botha said, also referring to another memo on &quot;Internal conflict in Inkatha as a result of peace talks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dhlomo, then also Inkatha secretary-general, resigned from the organization and the kwaZulu cabinet two months later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha added: &quot;If he (Buthelezi) seeks reconciliation with the ANC, there is the possibility he will be accepted and then removed from the scene... . If he stands on the political sidelines, then he won't be able to take part in the game later on, which will also lead to political humiliation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the fear of this division (of the police) that, bearing the above in mind, the minister (Buthelezi) will seriously consider throwing in his lot with the ANC with far-reaching implications for Natal and the ANC. With the release of Nelson Mandela, this becomes a serious possibility,&quot; Botha reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha went on to say that Buthelezi was worried that, with the release of Mandela, the ANC would be seen as commanding the support of most blacks, and many whites, Indians and coloureds, and that this would be used overseas to put pressure on Pretoria during the negotiation period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a counter, he says, Buthelezi planned a mass rally at King's Park on March 25, 1990 where he would speak against armed struggle and sanctions.  Botha recommended that police help pay for the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rally was a failure. It poured with rain on the day and only about 10,000 people attended, though Inkatha contested these figures. Clashes between busloads of Inkatha supporters and residents of Pietermaritzburg townships broke out before and after the rally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next few days saw some of the bloodiest conflicts in the area, including a planned invasion of Edendale by Inkatha-supporting &quot;impis&quot; (military regiments).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These revelations are supported by recent disclosures that there is a sophisticated plan by the government to use Inkatha as a conservative counterweight to the ANC during negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year Sipho Madlala, a self-confessed security police agent, told reporters in Natal that he had been recruited by officers in the security police and military intelligence to assassinate pro-ANC Zulu chief Mhlabunzima Maphumulo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other evidence is now emerging about clandestine support from military intelligence and the police for Inkatha so that the Zulu movement can be used to undermine the ANC.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accra -- Since the colonial era, most African countries have been dependent on a limited number of agricultural or mineral exports. During the last decade, plummeting prices for those commodities, coupled with rising debt burdens, have sent the continent's economies into tailspins. Ghana, where cocoa has traditionally accounted for over half of all exports, was one of the hardest hit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although talk of economic diversification has become increasingly prevalent in discussions about Africa's prospects, most of the action so far has been confined to conference tables and seminars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, after two decades of unsuccessful attempts to expand the export base, Ghana is seeing non-traditional products gaining ground as a source of foreign exchange.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to estimates by the Ghana Export Promotion Council (GEPC), non-traditional exports will have grown from five percent of total exports three years ago to 15% of the total by the end of this year. Figures from the first three quarters of 1990 showed that the value of non-traditional exports had already surpassed -- by 11% -- the value for all of 1989. In addition, processed and semi-processed products are accounting for an increased share of the sector, lessening the dependency on primary commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The upturn began in 1987, when the GEPC launched a phased program to promote selected products in agriculture, handicrafts and manufacturing. Using a variety of mechanisms, including flexible exchange rates, trade exhibitions and seminars for potential exporters, the GEPC tries to stimulate interest in the export trade. Ghana's government is offering packages of incentives for more efficient production, as well as establishing marketing infrastructures and working to insure that credit requirements of producers and exporters are adequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within each of the three sectors targeted for growth, certain products get special attention. The primary agricultural items are pineapples, palm oil, yams, fish and other marine products. Dominating the handicrafts are handwoven kente cloth -- perhaps Ghana's most-recognized product, plus artisan works of batik and straw. In manufacturing, the primary areas marked for growth include wood products, aluminum sheets and processed rubber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Selection of the items was based on the fact that the chosen products already contributed some 70-80% of export earnings in the non-traditional sector. The goal now is to boost the proportion of non-traditional products to overall exports. The campaign to revamp the non-traditional sector has given a substantial boost to both earnings and productivity. The GEPC reports that revenues from non-traditional exports nearly doubled in the first two years of the project, from $ 23.7 million in 1986 to $42.89 million in 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GEPC figures also indicate &quot;significant increases in the number of people engaged in non-traditional exports and products exported.&quot; In the first quarter of 1990, the number of exporters rose to 473, up from 458 in the same period the previous year. Earnings for the period rose 38.2%, to $ 10.20 millionfor first quarter 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although handicrafts have registered the highest growth rate -- doubling earnings in one year -- agriculture has continued to dominate the export field, contributing about 65% of non-traditional product earnings over the last three years. But Ghana's agriculture has been plagued by fluctuating output caused by the vagaries of weather. After a season of severe drought, non-traditional agricultural earnings declined 45% in the first quarter of 1990 over the same period a year earlier.  Nevertheless, earnings from pineapples grew 55% during the period, accounting for 86% of the sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manufacturing appears to be overtaking the other two non-traditional export sectors. Last year, for the first time, exports of processed and semi-processed goods exceeded those of non-traditional agricultural exports, increasing by more than 91% over 1989 levels. For the period January through September of 1990, 65.7% of non-traditional exports were goods that had been processed. In addition to aluminum sheets and coils, they included rubber, metal scrap, matches and agricultural processing machinery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghanaian economists say the trend towards greater processing of exports is important, because Ghana retains the value added by processing, rather than losing it to the countries that purchase its raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the goals of the GEPC program is to expand existing markets and to develop new ones. In the past, European Community members have been the largest customers for non-traditional Ghanaian exports, accounting for 36.4% of total value in first three quarters of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what may be one of the most significant developments for the future, exports to other countries within West Africa are providing a gradually increasing percentage of the total. Sales to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) grew by an official six percent in the first quarter of last year. Niger, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo were the leading purchasers, with salt being the major product. But West African economists believe the actual amount of inter-regional trade is much higher because official statistics are compromised by malpractices such as smuggling. A major challenge for the future, they say, is to devise multi-national policies that deal effectively with the factors that encourage illegal activities, such as prohibitive tariffs among trading partners in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Experts in the non-traditional area say that despite the sector's growth, its potential as a revenue earner has only begun to be tapped. But to become an important factor in Ghana's economic development, non-traditional producers and exporters will have to overcome numerous problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief among them, according to GEPC analysts, are financial constraints. Entrants into the export business seldom have adequate funds of their own, and their access to credit is limited. Banks have been particularly reluctant to make loans for agricultural ventures, both because of the lengthy gestation of most projects and the attendant risks. One recent GEPC report says that &quot;delays in processing loan applications in the traditional banking operation&quot; is another major difficulty for producers and exporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economists at GEPC are working to identify the ways that capital shortages hamper export growth. With support from donors, including the United Nations Development Program and the Norwegian and Swedish governments, the council has developed a multifaceted program to address the capital problem, as well as to cut through other bureaucratic and policy constraints to export growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * An educational campaign, aimed both at producers and at government entities, is employing advertisements, special publications and training sessions. The campaign is designed to increase awareness about the quality, consistency and packaging needed to make Ghana's products more competitive in a sophisticated international marketplace. GEPC stresses the importance of monitoring consumer tastes and preferences, and it conducts or supports research to determine which potential export products show the most promise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * In 1988, GEPC established an Export School &quot;to raise the overall standard of performance of export-oriented companies in the non-traditional sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Also in 1988, the council introduced what it called the Export Production Village concept. Although the program is still in its infancy, it aims to develop support facilities for rural areas and to encourage coordination of village-based production and marketing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The Bank of Ghana has supported the establishment of an Export Finance Company (EFC) to streamline the flow of funds to the non-traditional export sector. The company, which began operations last August, is a private, non-bank financial institution. By the end of the year it had financed 161 operators in 220 transactions, using its own resources as well as borrowing from the financial markets. Among the EFC's services are a refinancing scheme for banks that lend to exporters of non-traditional products and credit guarantees and insurance for export financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately 60% of the credit the company made available went to rural producers. According to a World Bank report, the access to EFC credit stimulated activities in packing and packaging materials, inland production, transportation, insurance and cargo handling. In the hope of providing more services to more exporters, the company is seeking to expand its capital base by increased shareholder commitments and government seed money and is exploring the possibility of help from foreign institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GEPC administrators believe that public participation and support is crucial if non-traditional exports are to approach their earning potential. In an attempt to broaden awareness about the export field and the role it is expected to play in economic recovery, GEPC has established two awards -- the National Award for Export Achievement and the Best National Farmer's Award.  Both are widely publicized and offer attractive prizes to the winners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA -- After seven years of economic reforms, Ghana has laid the foundation for a dramatic acceleration in growth rates, according to government officials in the West African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think Ghana is now poised to achieve rates of growth that the people in Korea and Taiwan are familiar with -- double digit growth rates,&quot; says deputy finance secretary K.B. Amissah-Arthur. If the effort is successful, Ghana would be the first African country to achieve sustained growth rates of 10 percent or better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If there is a country in Africa that can do it, Ghana is certainly among them,&quot; says Ajay Chhibber, a senior World Bank economist based in Washington, D.C. &quot;We're very optimistic about Ghana.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1983, the World Bank and other international donors have supported a series of policy reforms designed to reverse the downhill slide that had left the country's economy in ruins.  In 1980, a visitor to Ghana could find no food or clothes in the shops, no gasoline or spare parts for cars, and few working telephones. Roads connecting several major cities were impassable except with four-wheel-drive vehicles. Restaurants in major hotels served only rice and tea. The decline was a product of government mismanagement, corruption and, more recently, plummeting prices for cocoa, the country's major export.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today, a decade after Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings took power from an elected civilian government, stores are full of goods, new hotels have few vacancies, and the streets of the capital are jammed with too many cars.  Outside Accra, from one side of the country to the other, roads have been resurfaced, telephone lines are being strung, and markets are full of produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation looks good on paper as well. Between 1986 and 1990, Ghana's economy grew at an annual rate of nearly five percent, on a continent where rates of more than two percent are above the norm. Government budget deficits have been turned to surpluses. In 1988, Ghana's debt service obligations -- the amount of the country's payments on its foreign debt, including arrears -- consumed nearly 70% of its 1988 earnings. This year, after steady annual declines, the debt service ratio is projected to fall below 30% (see chart), leaving far greater revenues to be invested in economic recovery and growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even inflation, which is subject to variables that are difficult to predict, appears to be under control. After rising last year to 37%, the inflation rate during 1991 has been falling sharply, and is now substantially below the 1989 level. &quot;By the end of the year,&quot; says Amissah-Arthur, &quot;the average rate could well be about 10%, which is a rate we have not experienced since 1985.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund see Ghana as an example of how their policies of structural adjustment and monetary reforms can rescue failing African economies. The key elements of the reforms have been massive currency devaluations, the scrapping of import licensing and price controls, import liberalization, and the removal of government subsidies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all Ghanaians are convinced that the policies are working.  &quot;The impressive statististical glitter,&quot; says a professor at the University of Ghana, &quot;blurs realities which undermine Ghana's potential as a long-term sustainable model.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half the country's local manufacturing capacity remains idle, the professor says, with domestic enterprises &quot;smarting under foreign competition and exchange rate constraints.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Hansen, a founder of the opposition Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) agrees. &quot;We used to produce textiles and clothes in this country,&quot; he says. &quot;Now most of the things we wear are from Asia. And secondhand clothing imports are beating down local seamstresses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amissah-Arthur says the finance ministry is aware of the plight of local businesses and is discussing the need for some measure of tariff protection with the World Bank. &quot;A lot of the industrial development in southeast Asia took place with government support,&quot; he says. &quot;You can't remove all tariff protection and expect infant industries to compete from day one. We told the World Bank that they need to have an open mind about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organized labor is among the sternest critics of the government. In a letter to head-of-state Rawlings, the Trade Union Council said that the brunt of Ghana's economic difficulties have been borne by working people, whose minimum wages have remained below the 1974 level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are no clear indications,&quot; the letter &quot;that these conditions are going to improve within the context of present policies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank's Chhibber, who visited Ghana this month, concedes that structurement adjustment has hurt urban workers and civil servants, but counters that there appear to have been &quot;income shifts to rural areas where the bulk of the poverty is.&quot; He says the World Bank's now analyzing data from a living standards survey that may document that trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The persistence of poverty is the major reason to pursue double digit growth, says Amissah-Arthur. The finance ministry believes that only a rapidly expanding economy can raise Ghanaians' standard of living and provide jobs to reduce unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Hansen wonders who would benefit from rapid growth if it is supervised by the Rawlings government, and he questions the management of $ 2.4 billion in foreign grants and loans the country has received in the last three years. &quot;We want to know what has happened to all the capital,&quot; he says, &quot;whether it has been justifiably utilized or found its way into some pockets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chhibber says his organization is confident that its money has not been misused. &quot;This is not a government that doesn't know where its money is going,&quot; he says. Chhibber says that in addition to &quot;a very impressive&quot; government system of fiscal accountability, Ghana has spent World Bank aid money in highly public ways. &quot;Our money is in power,&quot; he says. &quot;Our money is in roads, telecommunications, ports. You can look at the education and health programs and the rehabilitation of the gold mining industry -- that's all very visible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scope of that spending is visible on Kwamena Ahwoi's office walls.  As Secretary for Local Government and Rural Development, Ahwoi is responsible for ensuring that development reaches the grassroots. Tacked to the wall behind his desk are maps of electricity plants, feeder roads and schools. &quot;By the end of next year,&quot; he says &quot;each of the 110 district capitals should be connected to the national electricity grid. Every district capital, no matter how small, should be served by at least a second class access road. Every district is to have a minimum of two high schools. By the end of 1995, every district capital must be served by a telecommunications facility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry of local government is also responsible for assisting the work of the country's 110 district assemblies. Assembly delegates were elected over the past two years in a process that officials say is building a durable democracy from the bottom up. A distinguished committee of experts is meeting down the hall from Ahwoi's office to craft a proposed constitution, and a national consultative assembly is to meet next month to consider the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary dismisses charges by the MMD that the Rawlings government can't be trusted to relinquish power. Already, he says, decentralization has given district assemblies substantial authority for planning and budgeting that is limiting central government authority. Ideally, Ahwoi says, all planning should spring from the village level, and future national development plans should be a synthesis of needs expressed by local people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amissah-Arthur says that the growing political involvement of ordinary Ghanaians has led to rising expectations for economic progress, and he sees that as a hopeful sign. He says confidence in the economy is a prerequisite for the investments needed to fuel future growth. &quot;Once people's expectations are that the economy is on the upswing, we begin to fulfill that prophecy,&quot; he says. &quot;We are seeing investments that just a few years ago would have been unimaginable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both government officials and international donors agree that the sluggish pace of privatization needs to be accelerated. &quot;There are many difficulties,&quot; says Amissah-Arthur. &quot;We have state organizations and corporations that have not had audited accounts for 10 years.&quot; Selling such businesses is a difficult, time-consuming process, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ajay Chhibber says that while the World Bank would like to see a faster rate of divestiture, it is sympathetic to the problems. The government timetable was &quot;very ambitious to start with,&quot; he says. &quot;These things do take time. And the pace has accelerated a lot in recent months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor is Chhibber concerned about last year's drop in the growth rate to 2.7%, a reversal that he calls &quot;a hiccup.&quot; A recent World Bank confidential report on Ghana says that the economic problems of 1990 were due primarily to &quot;temporary factors&quot; -- the severe drought that depressed agricultural output and the more than tripling of retail prices for petroleum products prior to the Gulf war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But both Chhibber and the report say that Ghana should give clearer signals to international businesses that their investment in the country's economy is welcome. Building an industrial base is important, they say, because without it, Ghana's economy will continue to be vulnerable to factors that are largely beyond anyone's control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meles said the agreement between the two governments involving the port of Aseb is &quot;being observed to the letter.&quot; Aseb, which is located in Eritrea but is Ethiopia's only major outlet to the sea, is operating as a free port.</SPAN></P>

Amnesty International last week released a list of 339 political prisoners reported killed in the country's prisons, military barracks or police stations between November 1990 and March 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">All those on the list are men who are said to have been detained in a round-up late last year, allegedly aimed at coup plotters. &quot;But in reality it appears that they were picked up simply because of their ethnic origin,&quot; says Amnesty, which attributes their deaths to torture or ill-treatment. In May, another human rights group, Africa Watch, said over 200 black prisoners had been executed or tortured to death. The government of Col. Maaowia Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, who is of Moorish descent like most of his government, responded to earlier protests by Mauritanians by releasing about 100 detainees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A two-month strike by university teachers in Cote d'Ivoire ended in mid-August, but uncertainties over the country's political future still linger. Late last month, the country -- long one of the most tranquil and prosperous nations in Africa -- was shaken by reports of an attempted bid for power by a group of disaffected soldiers. Brig. Gen. Robert Guei, the armed forces chief of staff, who announced the plot in an interview with the government-supporting daily, Fraternite Matin, denied that it was a coup attempt.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was purely a military matter,&quot; he said, indicating that the takeover was aimed at unseating him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the interview, Guei suggested that the plotters were manipulated by opposition politicians, who he accused of &quot;sowing confusion in the army.&quot; The army chief has been a target of criticism by opposition leaders and the teachers union for a raid on a university dormitory in May that reportedly resulted in a number of student injuries and the rape of women dormitory residents. Announcing the end of the teachers' strike, union leader Marcel Ette said the government had agreed to meet its demand for the withdrawal of troops from campuses and the removal of a ban on political meetings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lagos-- The National Republican Convention, one of Nigeria's two recognized political parties, has protested a ruling by the National Electoral Commission (NEC) that bans the party's Women's Advisory Committee. The election commission, which is charged with organizing, monitoring and supervising elections, says the women's group contravenes a regulation that forbids women and youth, among others, from setting up political groupings outside the main party structures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alhaja Suliat Adedeji, leader of the women's group, says it is not a separate entity from the party, but &quot;part and parcel&quot; of it, and that the commission and the Nigerian police are acting as enemies of the party. The advisory committee was formed to advise the party on issues affecting women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Iornem, a university professor and publicity secretary of the other Nigerian party, the Social Democrats, says his group will not flaunt the electoral officials ruling. &quot;We are not going to disobey the NEC by setting up an advisory committee for women,&quot; he said, &quot;but we shall put in place a women's counseling section to perform functions similar to those of the Women's Advisory Committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regulations forbidding extra-party organizations was designed to keep a tight rein on political organizing during Nigeria's transition to democratic rule. In the past, the country's elections have been plagued by corruption and fraud that discredited both winners and losers in the public's eyes. But critics of the NEC say it is wielding too big a stick in its attempt to control the process.</SPAN></P>

The group has established over 7,600 cooperatives, 1,700 new farms and nearly a thousand cottage industries, as well as shops, markets and women's centers. Babangiba also has raised funds to construct an international women's center in Abuja, Nigeria's new federal capital, and she is active in an informal grouping of African first ladies, who say their purpose is to improve the quality of life for the people of their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maathai is being recognized for her work as founder of Kenya's Green Belt Movement, which the Hunger Project calls &quot;one of the world's most successful programs &quot; in community development and environmental protection.  The movement has mobilized 50,000 women in the planting of 10 million trees throughout the country and has set up 1,500 nurseries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maathai led a successful campaign last year against the construction of a planned skyscraper complex in Uhuru Park in downtown Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. Her efforts attracted heated attacks from many top Kenyan leaders and resulted in the Green Belt Movement's being evicted from its office headquarters. Maathai moved the work to her home and continued her campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced cancellation of a proposed shopping mall and underground parking garage in another city park, a project which also had been opposed by Maathai and other environmental activists.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The constitution adopted on June 19 by the eighth congress of the Polisario Front says that economic and social development is a continuous process and that the people of an independent Western Sahara will need to ratify a &quot;new, definitive constitution.&quot; The current document is intended to serve as the &quot;fundamental source&quot; for that constitution. Polisario envisions an Islamic, democratic state with extensive protection of individual liberties -- economic as well as political. A free-enterprise, market economy is to parallel a public sector that is entrusted with &quot;the exploitation of those natural resources of vital importance to the economic development of the country.&quot; Among the provisions of the bill of rights are these:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * No one may be detained for more than 72 hours. Once this term expires, the person either will be freed or brought before the competent legal authorities. In any case, the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The death penalty is prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* No one may be subjected to torture, inhuman practices or acts contraryto the dignity of the human person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A citizen's residence is inviolable. Residential searches always require written search warrants issued by an appropriate legal authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The right to private property is a fundamental, recognized right that will be regulated by law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All citizens have the right to education and health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The state will aim to defend the political, economic and social rightsof Sahrawi women and will guarantee their participation in the improvement of society and in the development of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The state will draft the necessary laws to adopt a policy of social security aimed at protecting senior citizens and persons with disabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The constitution also provides for an independent parliament and judiciary. Legislators are to be elected by direct universal suffrage. Judges may not be detained, replaced or retired, except as preordained by law, and the Supreme Court will have six justices -- two chosen by the court itself, two by parliamentary election and two by presidential appointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this transition period, the constitution says, the secretary general of the Polisario Front will serve as president and the Saharan National Council will function as a provisional parliament.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paris -- Amid intense international negotiations to keep the peace plan for Western Sahara on track, Morocco has appealed to the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to delay a scheduled vote on the future of the disputed territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Wednesday, the Moroccan foreign ministry announced that Foreign Minister Abdellatif Filali would meet with representatives of the five permanent members to present Morocco's case. The statement followed a televised speech by Morocco's King Hassan II, who said the vote should be postponed because the United Nations has failed to keep to a timetable for pre-vote preparations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations officials say it is unlikely that there will be a response to the Moroccan request until UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar returns this week from informal consultations in Geneva with the Polisario Front independence movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since 1973, Polisario has been fighting for the independence of the former Spanish colony, which Morocco annexed after Spain pulled out three years later. Baba Sayed, a Polisario representative in the French capital, says the group believes that King Hassan fears the results of the planned referendum, designed to allow Saharans to choose between independence or incorporation into Morocco. The Polisario spokesperson says he expects the king &quot;to do what he can to make it difficult for the Saharan people to exercise their democratic rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of April, the UN Security Council formally established the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, known as &quot;Minurso,&quot; to oversee preparations for a vote. A cease-fire is scheduled to begin on September 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In practice, there has been little contact between the rival armies for the last two years, since Polisario declared a unilateral cease-fire. On the ground, Morocco has stayed largely within the confines of a defensive barricade it erected to enclose Western Sahara's main towns and its phosphate deposits. Polisario has roamed the territory outside the wall freely, occasionally taking journalists and other visitors to the base of the heavily-fortified barrier that bristles with electronic sensing devices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on August 5, intense fighting broke out. Morocco said Polisario was &quot;infiltrating&quot; military units into Western Sahara from refugee camps in Algeria, to gain an advantage before the cease-fire. The official Moroccan news agency quoted the government as saying that &quot;the Royal Armed Forces have conducted and are conducting sweeps and clean-up operations&quot; in the area between the wall and the territory's boundaries with Mauritania and Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polisario accused Morocco of attacking and bombing the group's positions in the town of Tifariti near the Mauritanian border, but it said it hoped the incident was &quot;an isolated act&quot; that would not disrupt the peace process. Later in the week, however, Polisario said air force planes were again on the attack &quot;outside the Moroccan defense line&quot; -- which it called a deliberate attempt to alter the status quo on the ground. Polisario Secretary-General Mohamed Abdelaziz appealed to Perez de Cuellar to intervene, saying that the attacks jeopardized the chances for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the secretary-general and the Organization of African Unity issued statements of concern, and UN officials stepped up their diplomatic efforts to secure international backing for the referendum. The French government said it fully supports the UN process and appealed to all parties to refrain from acts that might derail it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Thursday Polisario reported massive Moroccan troop movements in the territory and said it feared a resumption of serious clashes. No independent confirmation of the fighting was available. Interviewed by telephone at his Washington, DC office, Polisario representative Moulud Said said he believes the initial attacks were a provocation, designed to force Polisario to withdraw from the peace plan, but &quot;we didn't fall into that trap.&quot; The latest fighting, he said, is a sign of Morocco's desperation. He pledged Polisario's continuing commitment to the referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questioned by telephone about Morocco's charges that the United Nations has not completed preparations for a cease-fire, Minurso spokesperson Jamel Ben Yahmed said that the plan &quot;is still valid,&quot; until the Security Council decides differently. &quot;I don't think the Security Council would take any action without discussing it with the secretary-general,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Yahmed refused to comment on the Moroccan king's statement that the UN is responsible for the delays. &quot;We think that it doesn't serve any purpose to indulge in blame fixing,&quot; he said. &quot;But we have always said that the implementation of the peace plan is dependent on the cooperation of the parties.&quot; He confirmed reports that Morocco had refused to allow a United Nations ship of logistics personnel and supplies to off-load in Western Sahara. The group was charged with paving the way for the rest of a 1,695-person peacekeeping force that was to have been in place by the cease-fire date of September 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Yahmed says the United Nations remains actively committed to the plan and is proceeding with various aspects of its implementation. Resolving longstanding conflicts is never without difficulties he said. But he said it should be remembered that, &quot;from the beginning, the secretary-general said that the time-table in a plan of this type is an estimate. Some things may take longer than projected, but our job is to see that the process is completed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Polisario has been engaged in an internal struggle to open up its political processes. For the last two years, forces within the group have argued for movement away from the centralized decision-making of a war footing to a more democratic style of operation. That campaign achieved major successes at a Polisario congress in June, with the adoption of a new constitution and the replacement of the 23-person political bureau with a 53-member council of delegates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using national conferences as a kind of modern-day bludgeon for deposing dictators, Africa's democracy movement has scored several new breakthroughs this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In West Africa, Niger's national conference assumed control of the government and left military ruler Ali Saibou as provisional president with only ceremonial duties. Next door in Mali, that country's conference adopted a new constitution and set a timetable for elections in six months. And in Togo, long-serving President Gnassingbe Eyadema has seen his powers erode as a national conference there debates the transition to pluralist democracy amid calls that Eyadema be ousted or placed on trial for mismanagement and more serious crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national conference phenomenon began 17 months ago in Benin, when widespread protests forced dictator Mathieu Kerekou to agree to a meeting between government officials and a broad range of opposition, civic and religious groups. Gabon's conference a few months later served as a prelude to multiparty elections in October, the country's first since President Omar Bongo instituted one-party rule in 1968.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, national conferences have come to be seen as so synonymous with the idea of democracy, particularly in French-speaking Africa, that demands for them have become the focus of opposition protests in many other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meetings have not been smoke-filled-room affairs. Delegates are drawn from all parts of the country, representing a range of interest organizations and numbering from about a thousand in Mali to as many as 4,000 attending the conference which began this month in Zaire. In most countries, the proceedings are broadcast on radio and television and are avidly followed by citizens from all walks of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mobutu Sese Seko is the latest of Africa's long-ruling leaders to give in to the pressure for political reforms. Mobutu, whose 26-year grip on power has been severely weakened by a broad coalition of opposition groups, announced an end to one-party rule early last year. But he has continued to resist change by ordering troops to disperse demonstrators and by arresting opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, as pressures against him mounted, Mobutu relented and agreed to allow a national conference to take place. But since the meeting opened on August 7, disagreements between the president and his opponents have persisted. Charging that Mobutu violated an agreement on accrediting delegates by padding the meeting with government loyalists, the 200-party opposition coalition staged a boycott that has effectively brought the proceedings to a halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mali's national conference was the shortest and smoothest to date. In just two weeks of deliberations, delegates managed to agree on a new constitution establishing a multiparty democracy, a five-year presidential term with a limit of two terms in office, and a new lower voting age of 18. The constitution will be submitted for approval to a national referendum next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mali's newfound success came at a price. More than 200 people died in pro-democracy demonstrations early this year before soldiers decided to refuse orders to crush the protests and, instead, ousted then-president Moussa Traore, who had governed the country since a 1968 coup. Lt.-Col. Amadou Toumani Toure, who lead the soldiers in their March takeover, established a transitional government made up of civilians and soldiers and promised to transfer power to an elected government by January 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like many of his authoritarian colleagues, Zaire's Mobutu has rejected the notion that a national conference can claim sovereignty over the country's affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference in Benin set the pace on the sovereignty issue when it stripped Kerekou of decision-making power and gave executive authority to Nicephore Soglo, an economist at the World Bank who was summoned home to become interim prime minister. A year later, Soglo defeated Kerekou in the country's first free presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this year, a three-month-long conference in Congo chose a 153-member Supreme Council to govern the country until a new government is elected next May. After heated discussions of past government malfeasance, delegates reduced President Denis Sassou-Nguesso to a ceremonial role and initiated probes into corruption and misuse of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the latest assemblage to take charge, Niger's conference appears to have ended 17 years of military rule in the country. Saibou is a former army chief of staff who became president in 1987, on the death of Lt. Col. Seyni Kountche, leader of the 1974 coup which ousted the country's first president, Hamani Diori. Command of the army and the police has been transferred to the conference chairman, Andre Salifou, who is dean of education at the University of Niamey. The conference has also restricted foreign travel for government ministers and ambassadors and has initiated investigations into government abuses and transfers of capital abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sovereignty issue remains unresolved in Togo, where a national conference is now in its seventh week. When the meeting voted itself full governmental authority last month, the government delegation walked out, only to return a few days later. Since then, President Eyadema's representatives have remained in place while the delegates, numbering about 1,200, have concentrated on airing grievances against his 24-year rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the scheduled selection of a prime minister and interim government this week, the sovereignty issue will likely come to the forefront again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Cameroon's President Paul Biya continues to resist calls for his resignation and the convening of a conference, despite a national 10-week strike staged by opposition forces. The protest has halted normal commerce in most major cities outside the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition to Biya is strongest in the English-speaking part of the country, which includes Douala, the economic capital and major port. The country is officially bilingual, having been colonized by both France and the United Kingdom, but the former British-administered south has felt excluded from power by Biya and his predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Douala and other strike-affected cities, routine business is conducted only on weekends, when banks and shops open for long hours before closing again on Modays in observance of the anti-government campaign. Early this month, one wing of Biya's ruling People's Democratic Movement urged the government to agree to &quot;the people's demand&quot; for a national conference. Several government ministers also have endorsed the idea of a &quot;non-sovereign&quot; conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Biya has scuttled previous attempts to bridge the differences, including a church-led negotiation effort last month, by refusing the opposition's demand that he meet with their leaders as a group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although only francophone countries have held national conferences to date, pro-democracy stirrings are being felt in English-speaking countries as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, is establishing one pattern by its current two-party election campaign, ending in a presidential poll next year, Ghana is trying a variation on the national meeting idea as a prelude to voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana's National Consultative Assembly, scheduled to open this week, shares many characteristics with the conferences that have been held in several French-speaking states in the region. Delegates to the Ghanaian assembly will represent all areas of the country and a cross-section of organizations. Their mandate is to debate constitutional proposals drafted by a committee of legal experts and to prepare a document that will be submitted to voters in a referendum. In addition, the assembly is expected to establish a timetable for elections to return the country to civilian rule. The extensive deliberations are expected to last into December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's government, headed by Flt.-Lt. Jerry Rawlings, who took power in a 1981 coup, says the assembly will be representative because the bulk of delegates are elected by district assemblies which were themselves chosen during the past two years. Other delegates will be chosen by some 60 groups, including civic, religious, trade and professional organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Rawlings' plan has come under heavy fire from opponents. At a recent press conference in the capital Accra, an alliance of 11 opposition groups denounced the consultative assembly as &quot;fraudulent&quot; and called for a sovereign national conference to be held instead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Ghana's Roman Catholic bishops also criticized aspects of the government's transition plan and called for a specific timetable to be established for elections and a handover to an elected administration. The bishops said the ban on political party activity and restrictions on the press should be lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sierra Leone, another English-speaking West African nation, parliament voted last month to end 13 years of one-party rule. During debate in which long-stifled accusations of government misconduct were openly swapped, legislators also adopted a new constitution that is scheduled to be submitted to voters by the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, critics have assailed the government's announced intent to proceed with the referendum despite ongoing fighting in a large section of eastern Sierra Leone. Although government troops have reportedly recaptured several important towns in recent weeks, rebels continue to hold some areas and pose a threat to others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Joseph Momoh blames the fighting on Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor and the government of Libya, which it says is supplying the insurgents with arms. Taylor denies playing a role, saying the fighting is an internal matter led by opponents of Momoh, a former army chief who was the hand-picked successor to President Siaka Stephens when the latter leader retired in 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some opposition figures have called for a national conference to manage the transition to multiparty rule, others have formed parties and launched attacks on the government's performance, in anticipation of a lively electoral campaign as soon as an end to the fighting permits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another spirited campaign is well underway in Zambia, where President Kenneth Kaunda is facing his first real test at the polls since independence in 1964. Early this month, the Zambian parliament adopted constitutional changes that guarantee multiparty elections and deny the president the power to declare martial law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda recently announced that elections will be held on October 31 and will be monitored by an outside observer team headed by former American president Jimmy Carter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many observers believe that the largest opposition party, the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, can defeat Kaunda. But the 67-year old leader has signaled his intention to campaign hard to keep his job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, in East Africa, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya continues to resist demands for ending one-party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's only legal party, the ruling Kenya African National Union, this month rejected the latest attempt to promote multiparty government. Leading opposition figures recently announced the formation of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, led by a former vice president, Oginga Odinga, and several other former prominent politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Odinga's formation in January of an opposition party, the National Democratic Party, was declared illegal by the government. The Kenyan High Court this month upheld the government's stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Moi has taken several steps to placate his domestic and international critics. All leading dissidents have been released from jail, the party has halted summary expulsions of suspected rebels, and tenure for judges has been reinstated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the world watched thousands of people celebrate in the streets of Moscow last Thursday, 200,000 protestors flooded the main square of Antananarivo, capital of the Indian Ocean island nation of Madagascar. Nearly every day for the last 12 weeks, the country's pro-democracy movement has rallied massive crowds -- sometimes as many as half a million strong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Madagascar's demonstrators have been having as difficult a time bringing down the 16-year regime of President Didier Ratsiraka as they have of attracting international attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Monday, the opposition said Ratsiraka had been &quot;deposed&quot; and would be replaced by an interim government to oversee the transition to free elections. But the 54-year-old leader remained holed up in the presidential palace, appearing only once on national television to sign a decree extending the country's state of emergency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition coalition known as Forces Vives (Living Forces) has for the last 12 weeks staged some of the biggest ongoing protests anywhere in the world. Despite the huge numbers, violence has been a rarity. But on August 10, during one of the largest marches, estimated at 500,000, presidential guards fired at a crowd heading for the palace. At least 31 people died, according to a Madagascar Red Cross statement reported by the Associated Press. Another 20 people died in protests the same day in the northeastern port town of Mahajanga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The violence brought a swift condemnation from France, Madagascar's former colonial power and principal aid donor, which issued a statement calling for internationally supervised elections to break the impasse between the government and the opposition. France also suspended cooperation between 50 French military advisors and the presidential guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a swift fall from favor for Ratsiraka, who only two months ago received what the Reuters news agency termed &quot;a rare display of favor&quot; from French President Francois Mitterrand, who took the Madagascar leader on a personally guided tour of the Paris air show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mitterrand signalled a shift in France's approach to Africa in June 1990, at the Franco-African summit in La Boule, France. Instead of the unqualified support Paris has traditionally extended for leaders of its former colonies, he said future aid would be tied to democratic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Ratsiraka apparently weakened but holding on, talks began last week between government and opposition figures. Albert Zafy, who has been designated prime minister in the opposition shadow cabinet, told the Thursday rally he had been meeting with Premier Guy Razanamasy and Brig. Gen. Georges Randrianasoavina, a senior military officer who signed an army statement early last week calling for formation of an interim government. No details were released of the talks, which were sponsored by the Christian Council of Churches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the six-party opposition coalition met to draft a political program and a new government acceptable to all groups. Three more shadow ministers -- for education, health and agriculture -- were added to the cabinet named by Forces Vives last month. All three are from provinces outside Antananarivo, a move designed to counter government charges that the opposition lacks support beyond the capital, the Associated Press reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some diplomats speculated that the coalition was straining to maintain unity, pointing to the fact that the only statements issued in the name of the entire opposition were limited to attacks on Ratsiraka. One shadow minister resigned to protest the decision to stage the August 10 march which resulted in the deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear, however, that even a divided opposition would continue to pose a formidable threat to the Ratsiraka presidency. The continuation of large rallies, despite mounting public fears and tension following the killings of protestors, appeared to convince most observers that the government's days are numbered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1007 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNPAARED (UN Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development 1986 - 1990) was a unique compact between Africa and the international community. African countries committed themselves to necessary economic reforms as a basis for broad-based, sustained economic development. For its part, the international community recognized the need for intensified cooperation and substantially increased support for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, five years after the adoption of the program, the current socio-economic state of the majority of African countries continues to give cause for concern. The goals set in UNPAAERD are far from being realized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The great majority of African countries carried out a broad range of initiatives and reforms, as envisaged in 1986. The framework for reform in most countries was provided by structural adjustment programs (SAPs), since vitally needed external financing became increasingly difficult to obtain without the adoption of these programs. When they were first designed, these SAPs focused on short-term objectives of stabilization. It is now widely acknowledged that these programs must give more emphasis to the longer-term structural transformation needed in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries estimated that the full implementation (of the recovery program) would require total financial resources of $ 128.1 billion, ofwhich African countries intended to provide $ 82.5 billion through the mobilization of domestic resources. The remainder, just over $ 9 billion per annum, was to be met through additional external resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's efforts fell short of projections because the continent's main source of external resources, earnings from commodity exports, plummeted in the face of weak prices on the world markets. In 1986 alone, Africa lost $ 19billion as a direct result of falling commodity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of Africa's partners substantially increased their support to the continent, the expectation of additional net resource flows to Africa, in real terms, actually declined. Official development assistance stagnated, in real terms, while private flows fell sharply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's debt and commodity problems were not dealt with adequately, resulting in Africa becoming more indebted by the end of the program than at its inception - and earning a much-diminished income from an increased volume of commodity exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In light of the above, it is not surprising that the performance of the African economy remains highly unsatisfactory. GDP per capita fell by an average of .7% per year during the second half of the 1980s. Social conditions worsened considerably, with deterioration in the areas of education, health, nutrition, employment and incomes, with especially serious effects on children, youth and women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recurrence of drought in many parts of Africa, political instability, civil strife, military conflicts, weak institutions and, often, less than effective policies to mobilize and utilize domestic resources continued to be both cause and consequence of the poor economic performance of most countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There remains an urgent need for a major drive by African countries to reverse the socio-economic deterioration and put the continent on the path to sustained growth and development. This growth must be environmentally sustainable and development must be human oriented, with the effective participation of the African people in the development and the democratization of policy and society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A majority of African countries have carried out policy reforms aimed at improving efficiency and the allocation of resources. These measures continued to be pursued despite their often high political, social and economic costs, and have shown positive results. But in 1990, declines in economic output and in the delivery of social services had been slowed in many countries and even partially reversed in some. But the continuation of these reforms is being jeopardized by the lack of even minimally adequate resources. Neither socially or politically can this reform effort be sustained without improvements in public services and a gradual rise in real income soon becoming apparent to African consumers and voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that even the fullest possible restructuring of African economies could not generate the resources required for sustained economic recovery for the 1990s. A new compact for African development in the 1990s must be forged by Africa and the international community to support Africa's development strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The renewed global compact for the 1990s should contain specific operational measures to attain clearly identified goals. Three essential goals should be: 1) economic transformation and diversification (from commodity dependence); 2) an acceleration of the rate of growth of GDP (from an average of 2.3%) to at least 6% per annum; and 3) rapid progress towards human-oriented goals by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries have to continue adjustment efforts within a long-term framework with the objective of achieving structural transformation.  The international elements of the compact must include enhanced financial flows. Even more important than aid flows is the need for a bold attempt to tackle Africa's debt problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a need for renewed efforts at international cooperation among consumers and producers, especially regarding coffee and cocoa. Diversification provides a major way out of commodity export dependence and its related problems. Additional resources will be required to support diversification programs, through increased contributions by the international community, as well as more efficient domestic resource mobilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While there may be room for further debate on the ways by which some of these items are pursued, this consensus achieved during UNPAAERD can be the basis for future international collaboration. A renewed compact between Africa and the international community must be one that is fully observed and implemented by all parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much like Americans contemplating the steady slide in student test scores despite several years of educational reforms, Africans have endured belt-tightening austerity programs, only to see a continuing decline in per capita incomes and social conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But like the education problems in the United States, the African economic crisis is generating attention, debate and ideas. And the continent's spreading democracy movement, plus a slight improvement in economic growth rates, are seen by some as evidence of a silver lining behind the generally gloomy statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning September 3 and continuing through this week, the United Nations General Assembly is assessing the results - or lack of them - of a bold program adopted in 1986 to reverse Africa's economic decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 1 of that year, a Special Session of the General Assembly unanimously endorsed the United Nations Program of Action for African Economic Recovery and Development, 1986 - 1990. Despite its formidable name - even the program's acronym, UNPAAERD, is unwieldy - proponents say that the pact offered thoughtful guidelines for meeting achievable goals. The problem, they say, is that it wasn't implemented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar issued a report on UNPAAERD prepared for the General Assembly session. &quot;Economic and social conditions actually worsened over the five years of the UNPAAERD period,&quot; the report notes. &quot;This occurred,&quot; it says, &quot;despite the many far-reaching actions and reforms undertaken by African countries, including notable progress towards democratization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an unusually stern forward to the report, Perez de Cuellar says that &quot;the situation of Africa raises important questions about solidarity among member States of the United Nations and about their will and capacity to act in concert to address the wide spectrum of inextricably linked development issues, both within and beyond the continent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the report sees it, there was a measure of lip service to the compact on all sides. Many African countries, for example, have not gone far enough with economic reforms designed to streamline government performance, to remove bureaucratic impediments to private initiative and to curtail the privileges of special interest groups. But the Secretary-General devotes his harshest critique to industrial nations and what he sees as their failure to remove the international obstacles to Africa's recovery - factors over which, the report says, African countries have little or no control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General identifies three key areas where a hostile external environment has blunted Africa's ability to overcome its problems: commodities, financial flows and debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's earnings from international trade are far more important as a source of investment for development than foreign aid. But dramatic falls in the world prices for Africa's main exports sharply reduced the continent's revenues during the UNPAAERD period. In the five years of the program, African countries lost more than $ 50 billion in earnings from the drop in commodity prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The losses are especially serious because Africa is more dependent than any other region of the world on raw material production. Nine out of 10 African countries depend on primary commodities for at least 70% of their exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sharpest decline in prices during the 1980s has been in coffee and cocoa, major exports of 15 or more African countries. By 1980, cocoa prices were at a 15-year low, and by early last year, coffee prices were down to a similar degree. Despite reforms that allowed a 26% jump in production from 1985 to 1989, African cocoa farmers lost over $ 3 billion, due to prices that, in real terms, have reached their lowest level ever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continent's dependence on primary commodities for export earnings packs a double whammy to the continent's economic health. Because it produces such a limited number of products and has a small manufacturing base, Africa depends heavily on imports to meet its own needs, including food. And while the prices of its exports have been dropping, depressing the continent's purchasing power, the cost of its imports have risen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN advocates &quot;mutually beneficial agreements between producers and consumers&quot; of major commodities to stabilize prices and prevent wild fluctuations. In the absence of international agreements, individual producing nations are likely to take unilateral steps to try to drive prices higher, as Cote d'Ivoire did when it held its entire crop off the market. Although that effort was an economic disaster for Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and Colombia announced a plan to withhold 10% of their production in an effort to force prices up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than individual country action, the UN encourages greater producer cooperation to regulate supplies in order to avoid gluts and to pursue joint research and promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most promising effort, UN economists say, would be to reduce Africa's dependence on a narrow range of raw materials by diversifying in two directions - into new commodities, such as tropical fruits and flowers, and into processing or manufacturing that will add value to Africa's traditional exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, the UN report says that &quot;a priority for Africa is to increase intra-regional trade in food products, in both primary and processes forms. The elimination of tariff barriers and the improvement of transportation and communication systems within Africa are seen as necessary steps towards the establishment of an African Economic Community - a plan adopted in May at the last meeting of the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNPAAERD called for increased foreign assistance to Africa to support the economic reform efforts undertaken by most of the continent's countries. The pact called for external sources to provide approximately $ 46 billion in aid during the five-year duration of the program. Instead, transfers of funds to Africa declined in real terms, with net resource flows down from $ 24.6 billion in 1986 to $23.3 billion last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it hails many developments and reforms in Africa - in particular &quot;the enhanced role played by non-governmental organizations in promoting grassroots development - the Secretary-General's report chides African countries for continuing weaknesses in domestic policies and calls on governments to deal more effectively with taxation, the utilization of resources and capital flight. But it says that even the most complete reform program cannot generate the resources needed for sustained economic recovery.  In 1992, the report says, Africa requires &quot;a minimum of $ 30 billion in net official development assistance&quot; and a further increase of 4% a year until the end of the decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even more important, though, according to the report, is the reduction of Africa's $ 270 billion debt burden, payments for which consume over 30% of earnings. In addition, the UN says, debt reschedulings that have rolled forward some 40% of the continent's debt service obligations will provide a continuing drag on Africa's attempts to lift itself from its economic morass.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General calls for a cancellation of official debt owed to governments as well as of semi-official/export credit debts. Private and commercial debt, he says, should be reduced, with remaining obligations handled by creative programs that exchange debt for promises to invest in such beneficial projects as environmental protection and poverty alleviation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report's conclusion calls for a new compact between Africa and the rest of the world to ensure the fruition of economic recovery efforts. But, substantively, the conclusion is in Perez de Cuellar's forward to the document, when he warns that in the effort to wrench Africa out of &quot;an unrelenting economic crisis of tragic proportions,&quot; the international community's credibility is at stake. Failure on this issue, he says, threatens the world's &quot;ability to deal effectively with questions affecting its collective well-being and security.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

Rawlings announced the timetable at the consultative assembly, which is meeting in the capital Accra to consider a new constitution for the return to elected civilian rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rawlings has been accused by his detractors of delaying the election process and of buying time in an attempt to perpetuate the ruling council's tenure.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drawing of state boundaries touches on the two most explosive issues in the Nigerian polity - ethnic and religious affiliations. Babangida's announcement was met with both celebration and protest. Many of those incorporated into new states welcomed the move, while some protested because their area was not party to the changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida said that in deciding which boundaries to redraw, the government placed the &quot;utmost premium on political stability and social integration.&quot; He also assured Nigerians that the action would not delay the election process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the changes have necessitated a postponement of primaries for gubernatorial and state assembly seats from this month until October, the government says the timetable for general elections at the state and national level will be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida made the long-anticipated declaration on new states during an August 27 speech on the sixth anniversary of the Armed Forces Ruling Council's tenure in office. He told Nigerians that the council's policies &quot;are yielding encouraging results despite leakages in the system,&quot; an apparent reference to corruption. He reiterated the government is commitment to &quot;public accountability&quot; and promised audited accounts of all federal agencies and state governments before the handover to elected successors next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also defended the government's controversial austerity measures which were &quot;necessary to save our economy from collapse,&quot; he said.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire's unsteady movement toward political reform jammed again last week when a dozen people were reported killed by government forces who fired on a demonstration last Monday and raided an opposition party office later in the week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the violence, the national conference, which has been stalled by disagreements over accrediting delegates, had been expected to resume in mid-week. A coalition of major opposition groups, known as the Sacred Union, has refused to take part in the sessions as long as it was excluded from participation in the accreditation committee. The coalition says President Mobutu Sese Seko, who has ruled the country since 1965, is trying to pack the meeting with his own supporters. An announcement late last week said the conference could reconvene within a few days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has vowed to force Mobutu from office as a prelude to the holding of free elections in the country, which has a population of 37 million. The president's opponents hope to copy the successes of democratic forces in several other African countries, including next-door Congo, where President Denis Sassou-Nguesso was stripped of his power and left with a ceremonial position by a national conference earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now events in Togo have taken a similar course. Following an often tumultuous seven-week national conference, President Gnassingbe Eyadma has ceded most of his power to a new prime minister, Kokou Koffigoh, a human rights lawyer and leading opposition figure. For a time, it appeared that Eyadma was going to resist this latest in a series of developments that has steadily transformed the 53-year-old leader from a strongman into a near figurehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the conference moved towards conclusion on August 19, Eyadma suddenly appeared on national television and radio, pre-empting conference coverage to announce a suspension of the proceedings. He also reportedly ordered the dispatch of soldiers to surround the hotel where the meeting was taking place, but the troops never arrived, and it was unclear whether a formal order was never given or the military disobeyed. For 24 hours, the West African nation's communication links with the outside world were cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference delegates - numbering about 900 and drawn from all over the country and from a range of groups - ignored the president's command to disperse and proceeded to elect Koffigoh and vest him with authority to name a new cabinet. They agreed, however, to allow Eyadma to serve as president until elections take place next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several rounds of intense negotiations between national conference leaders and the government, Eyadma yielded. Opposition leaders helped by agreeing to reconsider elements of the new constitutional draft which Eyadma opposes. And diplomats from the U.S., France, and Germany - Togo's largest donors and trade partners - weighed in with quiet advice to Eyadma to accept what most Togolese saw as inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 43-year-old new prime minister, who is president of both the League for Human Rights and the Togolese bar association, is expected to announce the formation of a broad-based government that will likely include some of the president's own supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events in Niger, to Togo's north, have moved in a similar, if less definitive direction. The national conference meeting in Niamey, the capital, has placed some limits on President Ali Saibou's activities. He was not allowed to make a scheduled visit to Libya last month, for example. But agreement on a new prime minister and several other key decisions has proven difficult.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late last week, a group of young army officers said they had assumed control of the army after removing the chief of staff from his post. The officers pledged to support the national conference's program of democratic reform in the country, the Reuters news agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In neighboring Mali, a government shake-up was announced in the run-up to national elections scheduled to take place by January. Five of the ten military members of the ruling transitional administration were removed, following accusations that they took part in the killings of an estimated 200 demonstrators during the anti-government protests that brought down the regime of President Moussa Traore earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transitional council, comprised of both soldiers and civilians, took control in the March 26 military coup against Traore, who had ordered the crackdown on protestors. Another council member, Demba Diallo, a human rights activist, resigned to run for president. Mali's national conference, which met last month, decided that candidates should not hold government positions during the campaign.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The end of hostilities in Angola will not abolish large-scale suffering - and may not bring lasting peace - unless the international community whose weapons fueled the fighting helps to repair the damages, according to a report published by the Washington, D.C.-based U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR).  &quot;Angola's Post-War Inheritance: The Long Road Home&quot; was prepared by J. Stephen Morrison, a USCR consultant who served on the staff of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa from 1987 to early 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the list of pressing needs, the report says, is resettling the population dislocated by war.  About two million people - a fifth of Angola's population - have been displaced, and their &quot;expeditious and effective reintegration&quot; will be central to &quot;any post-war renewal of Angola's rural society and economy,&quot; says the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison identifies the continuing presence of huge numbers of land mines throughout the country as &quot;one of the war's most formidable legacies.&quot; The widespread use of these weapons has already created in Angola what many experts believe is the largest population of amputees in the world. Even though danger to civilians remains high in post-war Angola, Morrison warns that there is &quot;no broad plan of action for their removal, no existing capacity to carry out such a plan, and no serious discussion yet underway of how such a capacity could be introduced from without.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until they are removed, the report says, the mines stand in the way of resettlement and the recovery of Angola's once-thriving family agricultural sector and promises a continuation of the hunger and malnutrition of wartime.  Morrison says the United States and the Soviet Union, which helped broker the peace accord along with Portugal, should provide the funding and technical assistance needed for the task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report is highly critical of what the USCR sees as the &quot;chronic institutional weakness&quot; of the United Nations relief program in Angola and of the U.S. government's &quot;political and humanitarian bias in favor of Unita.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN's Angola relief effort, launched in late 1990, came &quot;nowhere near&quot; the goal of delivering nearly 20,000 tons of food to 1.9 million people in nine provinces. According to Morrison, it was the &quot;maneuvering for optimal military strength&quot; by both Angolan parties that is largely to blame for the failure. Unita's refusal to agree to a cease-fire prior to conclusion of a formal peace agreement delayed the dispatch of food to those in need, as did the government's decision last December to suspend the program for nearly three months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report charges that the U.S. also contributed to undermining the UN's effectiveness by sending &quot;sizeable shipments of relief&quot; which Morrison says were &quot;disproportionately&quot; allocated to Unita-controlled areas. The U.S.  Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, which made the assessments on which the distribution decisions were based, counters that the deliveries were sent to the areas of greatest need and were not politically directed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The actions of the rival factions and the role of the U.S. cannot account completely for the shortcomings of the UN relief program, the USCR report says, pointing to what it sees as the UN's failure to make credible evaluations of relief requirements. The report attributes much of the difficulty to inadequate staffing and inexperienced UN personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morrison believes the same problem threatens the effectiveness of the UN Angolan Verification Mission (Unavem), the peacekeeping force assigned to maintain the cease-fire during the transition to elections. The mission, which is to include 350 military observers, 90 police observers and 250 support personnel, is a &quot;risky experiment in UN minimalism,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With so much at stake for Angola, Morrison is troubled by the prospect that lingering distrust and bitterness and &quot;fierce competition&quot; in the upcoming election will block progress towards improving the lives of the population. The report concludes with an appeal to the Angolan parties for &quot;greater equanimity, compassion and competence&quot; in handling the country's difficulties and a plea to the U.S. and the UN for &quot;even-handedness&quot; and increased support for efforts to end long years of suffering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda - The peace accord signed May 31 by President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, head of the Unita rebel movement, has ended three decades of civil war in Angola. But health professionals in the former Portuguese colony say the country needs to gear up for battle against a different scourge. Peace, they say, will create conditions for the rapid spread of HIV, the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no reliable figures on how many Angolans already have AIDS.  According to the ministry of health, 211 AIDS cases had been reported by the end of 1990. But the ministry acknowledges that this count includes only the people who have been diagnosed with AIDS in public hospitals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Luanda alone, we should have a number of cases five times greater than that registered by the ministry for the entire country,&quot; says Maria Olivia Fortunato Torres, secretary general of the Angolan Association for the Fight Against AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torres launched the low-budget organization five months ago in an effort to counteract public skepticism and promote awareness about the disease's existence. She says many people in Angola believe that AIDS is &quot;a foreigner's disease,&quot; spread only by &quot;women who have come from outside the country.&quot; Her group's fledgling campaign to persuade Angolans otherwise is supported by donor organizations including the World Health Organization, the Angolan Red Cross, Medicines Sans Frontiers, and the Catholic aid group Caritas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think people here have been shutting their eyes to the AIDS problem,&quot; she says.  &quot;People say they don't believe AIDS exists because they haven't seen anyone die of AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is likely to change, according to medical workers. The long, gruelling war destroyed Angola's roads, bridges and communication systems, isolating villages from one another and from the outside world. But the opening of highways is gradually ending the wartime restrictions on movement and, in the process, demolishing the last fragile barrier to dissemination of HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With peace, people in the country will be able to move around more freely, and we feel we must be even more concerned with educating people about AIDS,&quot; says Elsa Montez, director of the National Program for the Fight Against AIDS. &quot;It is a fact that in the next few years, the problem of AIDS will be much worse in Angola.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Montez bases her prediction on experiences in other parts of the continent. An estimated 6 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are carriers of the HIV virus, according to World Health Organization statistics. And among the highest-risk groups for AIDS are long-distance truck drivers and prostitutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, which is about triple the size of California, trucks are able to travel across the country without risking attack for the first time in three decades. With the increase of trucks and their drivers on the roads - plus the demobilization of an estimated 150,000 soldiers as the armies of Unita and the government are combined into a unified force - health professionals predict that prostitution will flourish. AIDS will flourish along with it, the medical workers believe, unless the disease can be headed off by a massive national education campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although there have been no official studies, I don't think there is any reason to believe that the situation with prostitutes here is different from that of other countries like Uganda and Zaire, where it's been proven that a very high percentage of prostitutes are infected with the AIDS virus,&quot; says Montez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another worry of the AIDS-fighting groups is the impact of the return to Angola of approximately half a million war refugees from neighboring countries, such as Zaire and Zambia where the infection rate is high. A further concern is that an increasing incidence of HIV will contaminate the country's blood supply. Hospitals now test blood for the presence of the virus in only 10 of Angola's 18 provinces. By next year, the number is expected to rise to fourteen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the prevalence of AIDS inside Angola is believed to be considerably lower than in many African countries, the disruption of war has made the collection of accurate numbers impossible. And the military demands on both sides has meant that AIDS awareness campaigns have had a low priority in the allocation of scarce funds and personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montez's program will take advantage of peacetime by beginning a number of studies of high risk groups and their behaviors. In addition, in a venture sponsored by the country's health ministry, the organization has planned two large education campaigns to be carried out before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montez points out that while war may have slowed the spread of AIDS, it has fostered the growth of other maladies that will make Angolans more vulnerable to the disease when they do encounter it. Only about 30 percent of the population has any access to health facilities. Clean water and sanitation are rare in the war-ravaged provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In large numbers, people here suffer from hunger and sicknesses,&quot; says Maria Torres. &quot;In these conditions, the ability to fight diseases like AIDS is greatly reduced.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Torres' association has no single recipe to fight AIDS in Angola.  Convincing men to change their behaviors and have only one sexual partner in a largely polygamous society, where a man's value is often measured by the number of children he has fathered, often appears an impossible task.  But the Association, along with other AIDS campaigners, is aggressively promoting the use of condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Condoms have to be circulated like bread here,&quot; says Torres. &quot;But unfortunately, in Angola, it is very difficult to get bread - and it is difficult to get condoms.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">653 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New question marks loom over the future of Sudan following an apparently unsuccessful effort to oust John Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), the insurgent group which has been engaged in a bitter eight-year battle with the Sudanese government. Already the crisis in the Horn of Africa is seen by many experts to be the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">world's most serious humanitarian disaster. Relief officials believe as many as 15 million people in Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia face starvation this year unless emergency food supplies can reach them. The situation in Sudan, where 9 million people are considered at risk, is the worst.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort to remove Garang from the leadership of the SPLM and its military wing, the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), was headed by three military officers, who issued a three-page statement from their operational base in Nasir, accusing Garang of &quot;warlordism&quot; and a &quot;dictatorial and autocratic manner.&quot; The dissidents include Lam Akol, a top-ranking SPLM official, and two field commanders, Riek Mashar Teny-Dhurgon, another member of the high command, and Gordon Koang Chol.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang responded by releasing a communique signed by himself and eight other members of the 13-member SPLM high command and calling the dissidents actions &quot;meaningless.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLM, which controls most of the largely Christian and animist south, except the major town of Juba, opposes domination of the country by Islamic northerners. The Sudanese regime, led by Lt. General Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who overthrow a civilian government in Khartoum in 1989, is heavily supported by Islamic fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a mediation effort begun by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has showed some promise. Last month, Col. Mohammed Al-Amin Khalifa, a leading member of the military junta, visited Nigeria for talks with President Ibrahim Babangida, the OAU chairman. Nigerian officials said they expect to host peace talks between the warring parties soon, and Babangida appointed an experienced Nigerian diploma, to oversee the mediation effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissidents' statement criticized Garang for failing to press for peace and for giving priority to military goals over civilian relief efforts.  They pledged to democratize the movement, respect human rights, and &quot;relentlessly strive to attain a peaceful settlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garang countered with a memo from his headquarters in Kapoeta to supporters promising to continue &quot;all efforts&quot; to achieve a &quot;just, honorable peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the dissidents may have lacked broad support, some analysts believe their action may indicate growing sentiment in favor of secession of the south. Next door in Ethiopia, Eritrea has effectively gained its independence, and on the other side, northern Somalis have seceded from the rest of the country. &quot;It's no longer so unspeakable an idea,&quot; says one senior State Department official. &quot;We would like to see Sudan remain a viable united entity, but we can't deny that these feelings may be gaining support within the area Garang controls.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government has pledged about 330,000 metric tons of food for the relief effort- about half total worldwide commitments. The latest situation report on Sudan issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance cites as a major impediment &quot;a nationwide lack of adequate trucking capacity.&quot; Andrew Natsios, the director of the U.S. disaster office, returned from an assessment visit to the area last week, has taken a leading role in trying to persuade the Sudanese government to cooperate with the United Nations-directed relief program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roger Winter, director of the U.S. Committee for Refugees, which is actively involved in Sudan, has called for a &quot; tough U.S.-led international position&quot; to put additional pressure on Khartoum. This could be the &quot;only hope&quot; for saving many of the people at risk in the country, Winter says.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Togo's President Gnassingbe Eyadema received another blow to his rule last week when an interim civilian government formally retired the general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transitional government headed by Prime Minister Kokou Koffigoh is trying to break Eyadema's 24-year stranglehold on power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koffigoh, who was appointed by a national conference in August to head the temporary government, himself has been in a precarious position in recent weeks. On October 8, Eyadema loyalists in the army tried to kidnap the prime minister from his hotel but he eluded capture. The incident marked the third attempt by pro-Eyadema troops to topple Koffigoh, and set off violent street protests which left at least four people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The retirement of Eyadema from the army October 11 capped 10 days of disturbances which have left a total of least seven people dead, by one official count.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears are growing among Togolese that the danger of ethnic rivalry will increase the longer the country's political future remains uncertain. The Eyadema government heavily favored the army's Kabyes, who are from Eyadema's region in the north, while southern Ewes grew increasingly isolated. The cabinet has banned all street demonstrations until further notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyadema has called for the mutinous soldiers to be punished and ordered troops to remain in barracks. But those moves have failed to quiet opposition charges that he instigated the unrest and is sabotaging the transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elections are to be held next June; both Eyadema and Koffigoh are barred by the transition plan from contesting the polls.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pro-democracy demonstrators in Burkina Faso are encountering an unusual roadbock in West Africa. Instead of clashing with security forces, the opposition is butting heads with pro-government demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, about 15,000 supporters of President Blaise Compaore marched peacefully through the streets of Ouagadougou urging him to reject opposition calls for a national conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The march reflected rare civilian support for one of Africa's military rulers, a succession of whom have ruled Burkina Faso for the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On September 30, club-wielding pro-government demonstrators confronted opposition protestors while security forces did little but appeal for calm. At least a dozen people were injured in the melee. A day later, civilians wrecked the offices of two opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition is demanding a national conference on the country's political future, but the president's ruling party has rejected the call.  Twenty-seven pro-government parties have warned Compaore that if he submits to a conference they might boycott the parley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such conferences in several other French-speaking African countries have replaced authoritarian regimes with transitional governments leading to free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of Burkina Faso approved a new multiparty constitution in a referendum last June, and Compaore formed a transitional government September 10. Shortly afterwards, seven opposition members quit, protesting the government's refusal to hold a national conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president says he quit the army September 29 because the new constitution bars the military from office, and he intends to run for president. He wants the elections to take place in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition charges that Compaore will have an unfair advantage at presidential elections and that only a national conference can ensure a fair democratic transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Compaore has appointed a 15-member panel, drawn from both sides, to try to reach agreement on the conference issue. Failing an accord, he says, he will put the question to a national referendum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid growing fears that continued foreign backing for Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko could lead the country closer to civil war, the Bush administration still sees an important role for him. &quot;Mobutu says he won't leave, so we think he has to be included in any coalition arrangement,&quot; said one State Department official last week, as a transitional administration was being formed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Successive U.S. administrations have maintained close links with the Zaire leader, even when financial mismanagement and human rights abuses have proved an embarrassment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American assistance for Zaire has exceeded $ 1 billion since Mobutu took control of the country in a 1965 coup, but most U.S. aid programs have been suspended this year due to mounting arrears in loan repayments and escalating civil strife. The U.S. embassy in Kinshasa recently donated about $ 25,000 for emergency relief, and a $10 million aid shipment is currently en route to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For normal assistance to resume after the establishment of a democratic government, Congress will have to agree to exempt Zaire from the provision of the 'Brooke Amendment,' which bars aid to countries which fall behind in repaying debts to the United States. Liberia and Ethiopia have been granted such waivers this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same may not prove true for Zaire. Suppport for Mobutu, even from his traditional friends, appears to be eroding. A new memorandum from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has backed American aid to Mobutu in the past, says there should be &quot;no further aid&quot; until Zaire &quot;demonstrates a commitment to economic growth&quot; and introduces &quot;free market reforms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the administration appears reluctant to cut ties completely.  Throughout the Cold War era, Mobutu has been viewed as a valuable anti-Soviet ally and a reliable partner for covert activities in neighboring Angola and many other African nations. And despite the changing international scene, some of these old links continue to work in Mobutu's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the president succeeded in retaining control of key ministries in the new government headed by a chief opposition figure, Etienne Tshisekedi. While 18 portfolios are now in opposition hands, Mobutu managed to hold onto the ministries of defense, foreign affairs, and mines, the source of the country's vast potential wealth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cameroon's President Paul Biya has returned from a tour of the country's 10 provinces, saying the momentum towards democracy is irreversible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, reform can only occur through elections and dialogue, Biya said in a nationally-broadcast speech October 11.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He announced that general elections would be held February 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya also said he had asked the prime minister to organize a meeting among government and opposition parties and independent observers to discuss the country's future. But the president stopped short of calling a national conference, as the opposition has demanded, before any elections are held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The democratization of national political life is irreversible, but it is threatened by acts of violence, intimidation and force,&quot; said Biya, referring to four months of general strikes and protests which have alternately paralyzed and shaken this relatively peaceful central African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya's trip was largely seen as a show of strength in the face of mounting opposition. He returned to the capital Yaounde asserting that he was not &quot;opposed to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the necessary changes will be made, but we must not mistake the will for change expressed by the majority of citizens for a strategy of illegal seizure of power adopted by certain people,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reforms must be made through dialogue and consultation,&quot; said Biya, adding that a meeting among government and opposition parties and independent groups would be aimed at revising the electoral code and defining modalities for freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following elections, he said, a prime minister would be appointed from the majority group in the National Assembly and that person would be in charge of forming a government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya called on all political parties to begin campaigning and to use the opportunity to enter history &quot;through the front door.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. - Cameroon's government and opposition leaders are reaching out to the United States to help give their democratic transition a boost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an apparent move to quiet the country's sometimes violent cries for democracy, President Paul Biya has moved parliamentary elections up from 1993 to next February, telling Cameroonians in a national address that he is &quot;not opposed to change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But political polarization appears to be threatening the country's chances for a democratic future. The opposition coalition showed signs of strain in recent weeks, when it banished from the group three parties that had pursued contacts with the government. And a four-month-old general strike called by the coalition has failed to strong-arm Biya into accepting a national conference, although it has crippled the country economically.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is &quot;very much of a hot house political atmosphere&quot; in Cameroon, says Ned McMahon, senior program coordinator for the Washington-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI), a non-profit group which seeks to promote democracy abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, at the invitation of the government and with the opposition's approval, NDI sent a team to Cameroon to review a draft electoral code and draft legislation on press freedom. NDI, modeling its work in Cameroon on an earlier successful effort to unblock a stalemate between the government and the opposition in Senegal last year, is to release a report on its findings by November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, civil strife has continued in Cameroon. On October 14, two schools were sacked in the port city Douala following a police ban of an opposition march. Scores of protesters, including two key opposition leaders, were arrested last month during demonstrations in the city. There have been several deaths and injuries this year as a result of the ongoing clashes between protesters and security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strikers are demanding the convening of a national conference to look at a new multiparty constitution and an electoral system for Cameroon. As a vehicle to forge new democracies, national conferences have become commonplace in West Africa. After strikes and protests, national conferences in Benin, Congo, Niger and Togo have stripped presidents of all but formal authority and installed transitional administrations in their place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameroon's Biya, who came to power in November 1982, has rejected these demands but made some concessions, reviving the post of prime minister and granting amnesty to political prisoners. The National Assembly in April limited presidential service to two five-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political opposition became legal in Cameroon only last December.  Since then, the process there has drawn attention from other groups in addition to the NDI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Republican Institute for International Affairs (NRI) plans a November visit to Cameroon, where it wants to set up a &quot;networking&quot; program for democratic activists in French-speaking Africa. NRI hopes to establish similar programs in Angola and Nigeria to serve Portuguese and English-speaking Africa, says program officer Edward Stewart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Agency for International Development (AID) is developing a democracy and governance program for Africa and has been asked to talk to the Cameroon government and opposition, says Anne Williams, a senior AID advisor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our main emphasis from an AID perspective is, 'How do you sustain what is happening in Africa now -- what is the sustainability of the democracy movement?'&quot; she said. That answer hinges on whether the government and opposition can converge and unblock their lines of communication, according to McMahon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We found (the political atmosphere) to be relatively more polarized than in other countries&quot; NDI has visited, such as Benin, the Cote d'Ivoire and Congo, said McMahon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, one of the two parties excluded from the opposition coalition for having had contacts with the government was the country's oldest opposition party, the Union of Cameroonian People. To justify its action, the coalition expressed fears that the government is trying to infiltrate it and weaken its power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Additionally, two opposition leaders, Samuel Eboua and Jean-Jacques Ekindi, were arrested following a demonstration in Douala last month. An editor of the independent newspaper, Le Messager, was also arrested. All have been released.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon attributes the political polarization to a lack of neutral domestic groups that could soften political dialogue. In other African countries making the transition to democracy, there are organizations of human rights activists, attorneys or journalists that can screen and mediate political conflicts, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of such groups in Cameroon is due partly to a history of authoritarian rule -- including more than two decades under Biya's predecessor, Ahmadou Ahidjo -- and to the country's cultural diversity, says McMahon.  Cameroon has an estimated 200 ethnic groups and is divided into the French-speaking east and English-speaking west. It was colonized by the Portuguese, Germans, French and British.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Minister Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, who was in Washington this month to meet with U.S. officials and the press, says the government is willing to discuss the country's problems. However, it continues to oppose a national conference, says Booh Booh. &quot;The national conference is not an institution provided for in the constitution,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Booh Booh says the democratic process will unfold in Cameroon through seeking advice from experienced democracies, reviewing electoral law and media access and holding elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Attempts by the opposition parties to go against this normal process, this legitimate process, will not be tolerated for a long time,&quot; says Booh Booh. The government has already threatened to declare a state of emergency if the violence escalates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Washington-based representative for the Cameroon Democratic Party, whose leader met with officials here in August, says his party is not demanding a national conference, but it would not reject one. &quot;I think we need a new electoral code before talking about elections,&quot; says Fabien Assigana. He says the opposition is awaiting funding for elections from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McMahon thinks parliamentary elections will be boycotted unless changes are made to the constitution. &quot;I think the government is prepared to look at making changes in this regard,&quot; he said, noting that the government invited NDI to Cameroon. &quot;But again, how far they'll go remains to be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations last week appealed to the international community to refocus attention on the Horn of Africa and help meet a $ 300 million shortfall in pledges to the drought and war-stricken region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Donor distraction&quot; to needs elsewhere in the world is endangering the lives of some 22.5 million people in Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Djibouti and Kenya, said James Jonah, the United Nations' top relief official, in a monthly report on the Horn released October 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a pledging conference last month, only $ 110 million was raised for relief, food and health assistance for the region -- 25% less than what the United Nations says is required until December.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The effects of civil war, recurring drought and severe social and economic deterioration have been catastrophic for tens of millions of people in the Horn of Africa,&quot; said Jonah. &quot;In addition to the incalculable cost in terms of human life, unprecedented numbers of people have become either internally displaced or live as refugees in neighboring countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil war in Ethiopia and Somalia has pushed tens of thousands of refugees into neighboring Sudan, Djibouti and Kenya. All five Horn countries are wracked by recurring drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the shortfall in donor pledges and &quot;enormous logistical and political obstacles,&quot; Jonah said there was progress in providing relief to the Horn in September:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Sudan, 800 metric tons of food were airdropped and delivered by barge to feed returning Sudanese refugees. However, 8.5 million Sudanese continue to require emergency and rehabilitation assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Ethiopia, 10,000 metric tons of blood were flown in, but 8.7 million people still require emergency assistance, including an estimated 250 Eritrean refugees returning daily from Sudan. The World Food Program is scaling down its airdrops as the post-war crisis eases. More cost-efficient trucking operations are being expanded and the target of delivering 20,000 metric tons of food has been met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Somalia, 4.5 million people need emergency assistance despite a resumption of activities in the north between the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. Those activities include providing food aid, reactivating health services and restoring water sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Kenya, approximately 10,000 Somali refugees in two northern camps were relocated where vital services are being provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In Djibouti, most Ethiopian refugees have returned to Ethiopia, but there are an estimated 15,000 remaining in addition to some 80,000 Somali refugees who require assistance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations -- With the selection of a new United Nations secretary general expected within the next few weeks, African countries are stepping up their campaign to have an African at the helm of the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continent is the only major region never to have had one of its own in the UN's top post. Formal deliberation to choose a successor to Javier Perez de Cuellar, who retires at the end of the year, began in the Security Council about two weeks ago. But the talks are secret and no front runner has emerged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African candidate with the best chance to get the job may be Boutros Boutros Ghali, the deputy prime minister of Egypt. Of the six candidates submitted by the 51-member Organization of African Unity (OAU), Ghali probably is the one most likely to be able to get the vital endorsement of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe that the next secretary general should be an African,&quot; Nigerian President Ibrahim Babangida, the current OAU chairman, reiterated earlier this month in an address to the UN General Assembly.  Babangida said Africa's case is based on both &quot;competence and justice,&quot; reminding the UN of the &quot;distinguished&quot; names presented by the OAU. The list includes Zimbabwean Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero, former Nigerian head-of-state Olusegun Obasanjo, Ghana's Kenneth Dadzie, who is secretary general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), Sierra Leone's James Jonah, the UN undersecretary general for political affairs, and Francois Owono-Nguema, a former minister of culture from Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I remain optimistic that a spirit of equity and fairness will prevail and that an African will be chosen,&quot; says Vivian Lowery Derryck, president of the New York-based African-American Institute. &quot;Africa has an abundance of superb candidates who can serve the UN in its entirety,&quot; says Derryck, who is monitoring the race from her office across the street from UN headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many observers believe big power considerations may dictate the selection of a prominent figure from another area of the word. Other potential candidates whose names have gained ground during the discussions include Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, a veteran international civil servant and current chief of UN humanitarian operations in the Persian Gulf; Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The winner not only must get the vote of a majority of the 15-nation Security Council but also must avoid a veto by any of the five permanent members -- Britain, China, France, the U.S. and the USSR. Two new OAU members -- Cape Verde and Morocco -- took rotating seats on the council last week, replacing Cote d'Ivoire and Zaire. But Africa has only three votes -- the continent's third seat is held by Zimbabwe -- and must get support from other council members to elect one of its candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ten days ago, France formally signalled that it will veto any prospect who is not French-speaking. &quot;France will never agree to the future secretary general of the United Nations not being a Francophone,&quot; a French foreign ministry official said, according to the Reuters news agency. Two of Africa's leading prospects, Boutros Ghali and Chidzero, studied in France, but Nigeria's Obasanjo is not known to speak French with any fluency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the London daily, the Independent, Chidzero has the backing of the British government. But the decision, which was not formally announced, was made primarily to &quot;ensure an easy ride&quot; for British Prime Minister John Major at this month's Commonwealth meeting in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, the paper suggested. Britain, which previously has rejected the idea that this is Africa's turn to fill the post, could switch to another candidate when the final voting comes, the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus far, there has been no indication of an American favorite and no hint of focus on the race by President Bush, who once served as U.S. ambassador here. But many observers believe Bush will eventually take a personal interest in the selection and that his preference will likely prevail. &quot;In the 'new world order,' the Americans can usually get what they want around here,&quot; one senior African diplomat says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this reason, Boutros Ghali may enjoy an edge, since his leading backer, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, has a close relationship with the American president and might be able to appeal directly to the man most able to influence the final outcome. During a visit to Washington last month to campaign for the position, Boutros Ghali met with Bush, although U.S. officials say the president made no commitments to support him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some objections have been raised to having an Arab secretary general at a time when Arab-Israeli negotiations are a prime international concern. But Israel and its supporters apparently are not actively opposing Boutros Ghali, who has a history of involvement in the peace-making process. In 1977, he accompanied Egyptian President Anwar Sadat on his historic visit to Jerusalem, and in 1978 Boutros Ghali took part in the Camp David talks between Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times, in an editorial on October 4, argued that Boutros Ghali is the &quot;one compelling choice in a generally excellent field.&quot; His selection makes sense, the paper said, because &quot;he speaks sensibly for a third-world constituency fearful of being marginalized by the end of the cold war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AAI President Derryck, who worked closely with Ghali during the biennial African-American Conference in Cairo early this year, says the Egyptian would be an excellent choice. &quot;He has a keen intellect and is an experienced diplomat with wide contacts,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ghali's selection might not satisfy completely the concerns of sub-Saharan Africans to be recognized as world players. Although he appears on Africa's list, the fast rise of his candidacy has not helped smooth ruffled relations between Egypt and Nigeria, which began when Mubarak failed to turn up for the OAU summit in May, which was hosted by Babangida in Abuja, the Nigerian federal capital. Boutros Ghali led the Egyptian delegation after Mubarak cancelled at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further setback came last month, when Babangida visited Egypt to formally open the annual All-Africa Games. He was not publicly recognized or allowed to speak at the opening ceremony, sparking a furor in the always-lively Nigerian press. If Boutros Ghali is chosen, Derryck believes, sub-Saharan Africa should still have a turn the next time around. &quot;There are enough highly qualified Africans that they need to be considered and Africa should be given an equal chance,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">822 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita leader Jonas Savimbi says the Angolan government's policies have wrecked the country's economy and created such poor conditions that investors have been driven away. &quot;No one will invest in a country where he cannot make a phone call, where he cannot have a fax sent,&quot; Savimbi said during his recent U.S.  visit. Unita's detailed economic program for reviving the war-wrecked Angolan economy was presented to several meetings of business leaders by Fatima Roque, Unita secretary for economic affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are excerpts from her presentation, which was illustrated with slides:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adoption of the central-planned controlled economy destroyed the market economy that we had during the colonial period, destroyed human and physical capital of the country, destroyed the emerging Angolan entrepreneurial class, and disrupted totally the circuits of distribution. If we add those main economic consequences with the political interference in the economic management of the country, the poor economic management and inconsistent decision-making, with the ill-conceived and incoherent investment decisions and appallingly low productivity in most sectors controlled by the government, we will have the right recipe for severe macroeconomic distortions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Putting all this together we find in our country the following consequences: the almost total collapse of production outside the oil sector, a very high import dependency, rising balance of payments problems and foreign debt. Just to give you an idea, in 1990 the total foreign debt of our country is conservatively estimated to be $ 7.3 billion, very much above the GDP of the country -- it's about 128% of the country's GDP in that year...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We in Unita are committed to dismantling the centrally planned, controlled economy. We are committed to implementing a comprehensive program to restructure and restore the economic vitality of our country. The goal is to establish a private-enterprise driven, socially oriented market economy...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita has therefore identified four major economic policy objectives.  The first is related to the distribution pattern of income. The second one is the creation of an enabling environment for sustainable development and the reintegration of the Angolan economy into the world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third one is the definition of our philosophy itself and the relationship with development of the Angolan entrepreneurial class. The fourth one is the supply side of our economy that has been totally federalized since the adoption of the MPLA economic system. The fifth one is related to domestic demand, and the last one to better allocation of resources...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unita has identified priority sectors as far as foreign investment is concerned. The sectors presenting major investment opportunities are: the rehabilitation of infrastructures, commercial agriculture and agro-business, fishing, mining, petroleum and petro-chemicals, energy, transportation, telecommunications, manufacturing, light and heavy industry, banking and finance and wholesale and retail trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for our foreign investment guidelines:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the project viable in economic terms? Does the project contribute to regional development and linkages? Does it create jobs and train the Angolan people? Does the project provide managerial skill and transfer technology to Angola? Is the technology transferred appropriate?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does the project generate foreign exchange or save foreign exchange, whether we are talking about projects that will promote exports or projects that will substitute imports? ...  And is the potential investor prepared to reinvest the profits that are made in the country? ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides that, the foreign investor should have a technical capability and strong financial standing and a good knowledge of local conditions; an ability to make positive contribution to development, to invest in our priority sectors, and to integrate into the Angolan society, willingness to transfer technology, know-know, and managerial skills, to train the local labor force, and to provide vocational training and access to foreign markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is Unita and Angola prepared to offer the foreign investors? We are prepared to offer equal treatment. That is to say, all opportunities, all sectors in principle open to domestic investors are open to foreign investors.  We are prepared to offer security of title, access to foreign exchange, the right to repatriate profits and dividends, and the right to international arbitration of investment disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more important than that, we are offering you people an enabling environment for business that we don't have in our country at the moment. We are prepared to offer an honest and efficient public administration; reasonable, clear and consistently applied corporate and labor legislation; reasonable levels of taxation and double-taxation treaties; and realistic exchange rates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angolan President dos Santos's most extensive postulation of his government's economic policies were presented in a speech to the American Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. on September 17. Here are excerpts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We began our independence determined to create a new and more just society, and for most of us that meant adopting socialism, since our previous experience with colonial capitalism was synonymous with exploitation, corruption, and gross inequalities. In focusing on socialism or the just distribution of wealth and material benefits, we put too much emphasis on equitable redistribution. Unfortunately, we learned the hard way that the state was incapable on its own to produce and distribute sufficient goods and products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We also underestimated the entrepreneurial spirit of the Angolan people. In the short time since we started to take the reins of the state off the economy, our people have demonstrated a remarkable entrepreneurial capacity. Restaurants, clothing shops, businesses of almost every type, especially in services, are springing up. And this has brought an improvement to the daily life of our people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The restructuring of the economy already has begun to pay dividends.  Exports have increased steadily. In 1989, Angola became a member of both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We regard this as an important vote of confidence by the international financial community, as well as a valuable opportunity to gain access to technical assistance in the areas of budget, tax and fiscal policy, and general economic management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The technical assistance provided by the IMF has already measurably improved our budgeting procedures, and the new $ 23 million technical assistanceloan from the World Bank to facilitate the transition to a market economy will provide us with the expertise we need to continue our progress toward this goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the restructuring is making steady progress, there is need to accelerate its pace. To do so means rapidly enhancing our decisionmaking and policy analysis capability. It also means limiting the consumption of important imported goods and expanding investments in human resources, primary materials for factories, and capital equipment such as tractors, transport and telecommunications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our commitment to privatization was shown recently, when we privatized 30 coffee plantations that had been nationalized in the 1970s. Further privatization will come of agricultural properties, manufacturing companies, and services. Unfortunately, not all can be done at once. And, frankly, there are some types of activities that may require greater preparation for privatization than we have the capability now to act upon. But the direction is clear and commitment is clear...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our capital, Luanda, today is full of business people of many nationalities. I regret to say there are fewer Americans than I would like to see. One of my messages today is to call on American businesspeople to come to Angola to invest and to participate in our economic future. It is a bright one, and I believe your participation can be helpful -- vital, in fact. We need capital. We need technology. We need training. We want American companies to be part of our future...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the US is Angola's largest trading partner, regrettably there are some barriers to the normal flow of commerce between Angola and the United States. These barriers are a remnant of the past. Hopefully, the US government will see fit to remove them. In fact, they clearly punish American companies more than they hurt the Angolan economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also make US companies less competitive than companies from all other countries. And they have not responded to the changed political circumstances, either the Angolan ones or the international ones... I wonder how many of you are aware of the magnitude of lost business that US companies have needlessly suffered in Angola because of the punitive legislation passed in Washington. I wonder how many of you are aware of the magnitude of lost business with Angola that US companies have suffered because of these trade and investment restrictions...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I cannot end these barriers, but I call on you to do so. It is in your interests. There is much room to expand the friendship between our two countries and peoples.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- The American presidential campaign may be slow getting started this year, but Angola's two main presidential contenders have wasted no time putting in appearances at all the right places in this political town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an indication of the importance of the U.S. role in their country, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his principal rival, Jonas Savimbi, have in recent weeks paid separate calls on President George Bush at the White House and on key Congressional leaders. Both also made partisan pitches at think tanks and other influential Washington institutions and met with important business figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their visits took place against the backdrop of the end to a devastating civil war, which began at the time of Angolan independence from Portugal sixteen years ago and ended in May, when a peace accord was signed.  Now the long-standing contest between dos Santos' ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita) is moving from the battlefield to the polling both, with elections scheduled for late next year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Savimbi, whose forces have been armed and supplied by the U.S.  throughout much of the conflict, this month's trip to Washington, New York and Houston was a familiar stint. As he has done on a half dozen previous visits, the Unita leader asked for American backing and spoke of his commitment to a democratic future for his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This time, however, he said he did not come in search of money, although the Bush administration has pledged a continuation of covert U.S.  assistance to ease Unita's transition from a guerrilla force to a political party. Rather, Savimbi said, he was seeking to ensure continued American attention to the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without outside pressure, particularly from the U.S., Savimbi told reporters at a breakfast meeting in New York, &quot;we will not have elections before 1993 or 1994.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But dos Santos, who was making his first Washington pilgrimage, gave assurances at every stop that elections will take place as scheduled. &quot;We are determined to proceed along the course we have charted for ourselves,&quot; he said in several of his appearances. A specific date for the voting will be set after consultations with all the political parties, now numbering about 30, as called for in the peace accord, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversy over an election date, reflecting the deep distrust which divides the two principal parties, is an outgrowth of a disagreement which delayed settlement for many months. The government originally sought a 36-month timetable, during which a census would be held, voters' rolls prepared, and campaigning would take place. But the compromise accord worked out with Portuguese mediation and the active involvement of the U.S. and USSR, states that the vote will take place between September and November of 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi made clear his belief that he has been promised a September election, and he pressed his case against any later date. Speaking of his MPLA rivals, the Unita leader told reporters that &quot;they want to delay to improve their image&quot; prior to the election to improve their standing with voters.  Savimbi, who said dos Santos fears an election loss, predicted that &quot;if we have a free and fair election, Unita will win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both leaders made a point of appealing for American investment and trade. Addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, dos Santos said Angola needs capital and technology and wants &quot;American companies to be part of our future.&quot; At a time of &quot;tremendous world change,&quot; Angola is changing as well, he said, an indirect reference to the close ties and extensive support the MPLA has received from both the Soviet Union and Cuba. &quot;I do not hide the fact that I have been head of a socialist government,&quot; he said, &quot;but we are a Marxist government no longer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Savimbi sought to sow doubts about the MPLA's ideological conversion and argued that a Unita-led government would be far more hospitable to foreign investors than the present regime. Speaking to a business luncheon at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation here, he promised &quot;privatization of all the land and enterprises confiscated by the government&quot; and &quot;a new law which will guarantee those investments.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the future U.S. role in Angola, dos Santos said he had been assured by Bush of American neutrality in the election period. But in answer to questions at several stops, he admitted to some skepticism. The fact that the Congressional aid authorization for Angola includes a continuing covert component suggests, he said, &quot;that we may be confronted by two conflicting American faces.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders struck several similar notes. Both sought to rebut notions that their parties are regionally or ethnically based. And each emphasized that there is no possibility for a return to the state of war that their country has known for three decades, including the 15-year independence campaign that preceded independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both trips were professionally managed by people knowledgeable about the way Washington works. The Angolan government, which previously has used a variety of public relations and lobbying agents -- often without coordination among them -- this time hired the respected Washington firm Hill and Knowlton to put together a busy four days of meetings. Arrangements for Savimbi were handled by Black, Manafort, Stone, and Kelly, the political consulting group that has represented Unita in Washington for a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the U.S. government has announced a new allocation of $ 6 million in emergency assistance for Angola. On October 1, at the beginning of the new fiscal year for the U.S., Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen re-issued a disaster declaration for Angola for the fourth year in succession.  According to a situation report issued last week by the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance at the State Department, the funds will be used to provide food supplies and to pay for an airlift of food and other needed supplies to 12 &quot;severely stressed&quot; centers, where Unita soldiers are being demobilized.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They've been sat on; they've been slept on; they've been carried.&quot; That, says curator Roslyn Walker, is part of the mystique of the pieces in the new permanent collection at the National Museum of African Art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collection, called &quot;The Art of the Personal Object,&quot; is the third permanent exhibit to be installed since the museum opened four years ago in Washington, D.C. as part of the Smithsonian Institution. A fourth permanent collection -- &quot;Purpose and Perfection: Pottery as a Women's Art in Central Africa&quot; -- will open on January 15. The personal objects exhibit that opened September 25 has over 100 pieces used in everyday life, primarily from eastern and southern Africa. It is, says curator Walker, &quot;the rest of the story&quot; of traditional art. It is immediately obvious to the viewer, she says, that these objects,although very beautiful, are &quot;art for domestic purposes rather than for ritual,&quot; in contrast to exhibits dominated by sacred pieces or emblems of office such as masks, staffs and anthropomorphic sculpture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Philip L. Ravenhill, the African Art museum's chief curator, says that the pieces in the exhibit are &quot;singular examples of both individual creativity and the creativity of African cultures.&quot; And he says that the origins of the objects makes the museum's collection more representative of the continent.  East and southern Africa, he says, &quot;have usually been underrepresented in both private and public collections of African art.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bulk of the new exhibit was purchased in 1989 from colonial collections assembled in Great Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been increasing interest among artists and art historians in what Ravenhill calls &quot; the integration of aesthetics and daily life in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan has just opened an exhibit called &quot;African-American Family Life and Culture&quot; which features a gourd collection belonging to Duke University historian Peter Wood. Wood says West Africans brought gourds to the American south, where their use flourished in the 18th and 19th centuries. His collection includes two beaded shekeres, West African percussion instruments. Banjos -- originally an African instrument -- as well as drums and certain fiddles were all once made with gourds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durable and replaceable, gourds were &quot;the plastic of the pre-modern world,&quot; Wood says. The ways they were decorated, he says, is yet another example of how frequently Africans made ornaments out of objects of daily use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African art museum's new collection vividly illustrates that phenomenon with a group of snuff containers from Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique made from hard fruit shells trimmed with wire. The theme will be developed more fully in a 32-page booklet the Museum of African Art is publishing on the &quot;personal objects&quot; collection later this year and a booklet that will accompany the women's pottery exhibit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year, over 300,000 people have visited the museum. n</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum of African Art is trying to expand an appreciation for the diversity and sophistication of African artistic expression through a series of lectures, discussions, family programs and workshops for teachers.

The agreement calls for elections to be held in six months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a two-day summit in Yamoussoukro, the capital of Cote d'Ivoire, 12 of the 16 members of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) endorsed an accord which will give control of all of Liberian territory to the West African peace-keeping forces known as Ecomog within 60 days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecomog, which now polices only the capital Monrovia, will take charge of all border posts, sea and air ports, and checkpoints throughout the country. Rebel leader Charles Taylor, whose forces now hold most of the territory, agreed to accept the expansion of Ecomog's role during late-night bargaining and heavy pressure on Taylor from several west African heads of state who have supported him in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique detailing the disarmament process is being prepared for release this week, Ivorian foreign ministry officials said. Once the disarmament has taken place, election preparations will intensify.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tunisia appears to have taken a step towards human rights as it struggles to enter Africa's expanding democratic fold, but critics say its government has reneged on earlier commit-ments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After seizing power from an aging and ailing Habib Bourguiba in 1987, President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali freed thousands of political prisoners, most of them Islamic militants, who had been detained under Bourguiba's rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Ali vowed to put the North African country on the road to democracy, and by 1989 he had legalized political pluralism and liberalized press freedom. He has also announced new measures of support for Tunisia's six legal opposition parties, including about $ 60,000 in financial assistance a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ben Ali has kept a tight control on the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and refuses to legalize the main Islamic opposition party, an-Nahda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is that issue which has some Tunisians saying Ben Ali's path to democracy is paved with good intentions but marred with abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The human rights group Amnesty International has expressed its concern to the government over what it says is a deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia in the past year. The group urged Tunis to investigate numerous allegations of torture of political detainees, mostly members or suspected members of an-Nahda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June 1991, Tunisian courts sentenced to death five an-Nahda members accused of attacking the ruling party headquarters in February this year.  Eighteen others were sentenced to life or long prison terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 11, Amnesty said it &quot;deeply regrets&quot; the hangings and regreted that Ben Ali had rejected appeals for clemency despite his stated opposition to the death penalty. Former president Bourguiba advocated capital punishment, and Ben Ali used his own rejection of such measures as one of his justifications for seizing power. The first execution since 1987 was carried out last year, Amnesty said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Islamic issue is no longer solely a domestic concern. Tunisia last month said it was recalling its ambassador from Khartoum to protest what it said was Sudan's support of a coup attempt. Members of an-Nahda now face trial in Tunisia for the alleged plot to kill the president and members of his cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunisia, historically the most open of the Arab countries, is an unlikely place for Islamic fervor, and an-Nahda has shown signs of weakness. It split during the Gulf War; one group opposed to Iraq's Saddam Hussein sought to establish a new Islamic party which eschews religious absolutes and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of an-Nahda's members left the group following the attack on the ruling party's offices, and Ben Ali immediately opened a dialogue with them.  But whether he will follow in Algeria's steps and give Islamic fundamentalists a legal voice remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter was signed by Donald Payne (D-NJ), Dan Burton (R-IN), Amo Houghton (R-NY), Stephen Solarz (D-NY), and Howard Wolpe (D-MI), all members of the Foreign Relations Africa subcommittee. Mervyn Dymally (D-CA), the subcommittee chairman, did not join in the appeal. Payne also introduced a resolution supporting democratic change in Zaire and calling upon the administration to &quot;use its influence to persuade President Mobutu to respect the wishes of the democratic forces in Zaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawmakers say it is &quot;essential&quot; to avoid a repetition of two earlier African crises, Liberia and Somalia, &quot;where a hands-off American policy, combined with a refusal to insist on the departure of formerly U.S.-backed dictators Samuel Doe and Mohammed Siad Barre, contributed to the unraveling of the political fabric and ultimately to bloody fratricidal strife.&quot; And they called for a coordinated effort with Zaire's two other major backers, France and Belgium. On Friday, the last French paratroopers left Zaire, and Belgium promised a quick pullout of its remaining forces after it oversees the evacuation of the last of more than 20,000 foreigners fleeing the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition leaders pleaded for foreign troops to stay to prevent massive bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislators' letter asks Bush to back peace-keeping efforts and to urge the French and Belgians to remain &quot;until an appropriate international peace-keeping force&quot; can be organized.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Madagascar's government and opposition have agreed to form an 18-month transitional administration. Last week's accord came just days after the military hinted that it might take matters into its own hands unless a five-month political stalemate was unblocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The island nation has suffered a series of sector-specific strikes since early June to pressure President Didier Ratsiraka to resign and to win reform. Defense Minister Philippe Ramakavelo called the deadlock &quot;collective suicide.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the deal, which apparently leaves Ratsiraka in power, Prime Minister Guy Razanamasy and the opposition's shadow government promised a referendum on a new constitution before the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The referendum would include changes to electoral laws and would be followed by presidential elections, the two sides said in a statement broadcast on state radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratsiraka -- who had ruled Madagascar for 14 years before he was re-elected in a 1989 vote the opposition claims was rigged -- had agreed to talks on electoral and constitutional reforms, but he has refused to step down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 24, about 50,000 people thronged the center of Antananarivo, the capital, for a religious service to mark the end of prolonged strikes that economists say has left some industries bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return to work represents &quot;a new form of struggle,&quot; not weakness, an opposition spokesman told Radio France Internationale, and reflects a desire to &quot;make our government effective.&quot; But, he said the opposition would continue to stage peaceful mass rallies in Antananarivo which has seen demonstrations attracting hundreds of thousands of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least two people were killed and about a dozen others wounded October 24 in the northern town of Antsiranana when demonstrators clashed with security forces near the residence of the provincial governor, Amnesty International said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That violence was the worst since August 10 when troops guarding the presidential palace opened fire on thousands of demonstrators. At least 31 people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-party opposition coalition, known as Forces Vives, has already effectively seized a large degree of autonomy from the government, declaring five of the country's six regions &quot;federated states.&quot; In August it named a shadow government to lead the island's 10 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military, which has maintained political neutrality in the conflict, had been growing increasingly frustrated with the protracted deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 26, the armed forces warned that they would step in if an agreement on forming a government capable of restoring confidence was not reached soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The armed forces solemnly declare they will take their responsibilities to preserve public order and defend the nation's vital interests,&quot; Reuters news agency quoted a broadcast statement by General Ramakavelo as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His comments appeared to signal the growing possibility of a military takeover to end the political deadlock between Ratsiraka's regime and the Forces Vives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International aid donors and creditors, who want to see Madagascar back on what they judged a largely successful track of economic reform, had also expressed their frustration over Madagascar's political crisis.  &quot;Ratsiraka's government is under no illusion that donors and creditors will not come into the picture&quot; if economic reform continues to slacken, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors and creditors communicated this sentiment to Malagasy government representatives at the recent annual World Bank and IMF meetings in Bangkok, the official said. That pressure provided further incentive for Ratsiraka to move to break the political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The international community expects the process of democratization to accelerate before resuming financial and economic assistance,&quot; says the IMF official. Opposition parties were legalized in the former French colony last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the view of donors, the Indian Ocean nation was just beginning to show real signs of growth stemming from Ratsiraka's economic reform program when the unrest erupted. A flood of economic aid poured in after the formerly Socialist leader sold off some state firms, lifted state controls on domestic and foreign trade and liberalized laws on private banking and investment. In 1989 and 1990, some $ 18.2 million were invested in Madagascar, according to theLondon-based newsletter, Africa Confidential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the recent strife has made investors wary, economists say. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has put on hold a plan to send a team of potentitial investors to meetings in Bangkok warning that the country was bankrupt. He said state wages -- $ 20 million for the government staff and the military -- could not be paid because the crisis had completely emptied government coffers. The average per capita income already is one of the world's lowest, about $ 225 a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How far short they are of the economic targets we established -- no one can know,&quot; the IMF official says. National output will likely be &quot;a lot less,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he downplayed reports of severe damage to the island's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The damage to economic infrastructure is minimal because there hasn't been large-scale violence in this political turmoil,&quot; he said. &quot;It hasn't taken that much of a beating. Nobody has burned buildings, or factories. People haven't gone crazy on property, so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 85% of the population works in agriculture, and tourism is an important industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some government workers went back to their jobs at the end of October.  But the IMF official says that is &quot;nothing to get excited about&quot; because fluctuations in attendance are normal during such periods of unrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if there are no paychecks, the situation could deteriorate, says the political analyst. &quot;You know, if you don't pay the workers -- that's what happened in Zaire.&quot; Zairian soldiers went on a looting rampage in September after not receiving their pay, sparking a showdown between the government and pro-democracy forces that has left the country in turmoil.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brussels -- President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire defies everybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty thousand foreigners have fled the turmoil in his country; Belgium and France, who have backed him for 25 years, are now pressing him to compromise with his opponents; the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have cut off their loans; and his own people are determined that he will leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mobutu has thumbed his nose at them all. He has dismissed Etienne Tshisekedi wa Malumba, the popular prime minister he was forced to appoint last month by pro-democracy demonstrators. In Tshisekedi's place, Mobutu appointed another former political rival, Mungul Diaka. The new Zaire cabinet, intended by government opponents to be part of a transition towards democratic rule, leaves several key ministries -- defense, foreign affairs and mines and planning -- firmly in Mobutu's grip. As a result, he still has authority to ask the bank to give him money, to nominate ambassadors from among those still loyal to him, and to control any remaining foreign assistance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the country is in shambles. A national conference, finally held during the summer at the insistence of Mobutu's opponents, attempted both to design future institutions for Zaire and to fix responsibilities for past problems. There were high hopes among the diverse political and civic groups which demanded the meeting that Mobutu's political career was finished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proved to be a serious miscalculation: Mobutu apparently is uninterested in going into exile at one of his luxury mansions in Morocco, France or Switzerland. He still considers himself the father, the &quot;Guide,&quot; of Zaire and intends to cling to power as long as he can. His skillful manipulation of the conference showed his intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the more than 4,000 delegates who assembled in the Palace of the People in Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, the majority were fake opponents, representatives of fake citizen organizations or open Mobutu followers.  Mobutu's agents openly &quot;bought&quot; consciences by distributing huge sums of money to delegates. That wasn't a difficult feat -- the government had money printed in Zurich and flown to Zaire. The rate of inflation rose to 3,000 percent for the year, further eroding salaries and wages of soldiers and civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Orchestrated by Mobutu and badly organized, the national conference collapsed. The Union Sacree, a grouping of the main opposition parties, pulled out of the meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How has Mobutu again eluded what had seemed to be an opposition stranglehold?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man is a gambler. This time he gambled with the army. In early September, a mutiny in Kinshasa saw soldiers looting warehouses, shops and houses of foreigners, prompting France and Belgium to send troops to protect their nationals. There is evidence that the soldiers wages had been witheld intentionally by the government, in the expectation that foreign intervention would stabilize the regime, as has happened so often in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is possible that this time it is Mobutu himself who has miscalculated. Perhaps he had not expected the revolt to spread so quickly throughout the country nor the pressures against him to be so strong. Instead of backing him as they did during an intervention 12 years ago, France and Belgium insisted that Mobutu deal with Tshisekedi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The compromise that resulted in the naming of Tshisekedi as prime minister, after long and painful negotiations, lasted only two days. Mobutu's claim that he was dismissing his rival for not respecting the constitution is believed by nobody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The real story is this: two days after Tshisekedi's appointment, Mobutu asked the national bank of Zaire for his usual disbursement of a million dollars. But this time the governor of the bank asked the approval of the finance minister, who refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because money is the lifeblood of the Mobutu system of governing, the president cannot survive in power without free access to the bank. The riots and lootings that followed Tshisekedi's dismissal have spread, and most foreign nationals have now been evacuated, leaving the Zaire people to suffer the consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At this stage, the Zaire army is playing no political role. It is like a wild dog out of control, looting and threatening civilians, destroying infrastructure and factories. Soldiers are stealing, generals participate in the looting, and nobody seems able to monitor or temper their actions. Mobutu himself, protected by his well-armed presidential guard, holds onto power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Was it really possible for Zairians to oust Mobutu? Belgians and French were expecting him to leave, but an OK from the U.S. was not forthcoming. Washington decision-makers still believe, against all evidence, that Mobutu is in charge, that he is a guarantor of stability. Behind this odd view may be the 30-year friendship between Mobutu and the Central Intelligence Agency, whose projects he has supported in such places as Angola and Chad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials have kept a remarkably low profile during the latest Zaire crisis. While Melissa Wells, the ambassador in Kinshasa, was very active during the summer, pressuring for human rights, she has been silent this autumn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Zaire watchers fear that the U.S., preoccupied by the Middle East and other issues, will delay action on Zaire until it becomes too late to influence events. Mobutu may still be there, but he will sit atop a smashed opposition and a destroyed country.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fall of the Ethiopian government in Addis Ababa at the end of May brought three decades of war to an end for the people of Eritrea, who stubbornly resisted incorporation by two successive Ethiopian regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now formally autonomous -- until a referendum to decide the future is held in two years -- Eritrea is establishing its own administration. The scheduled vote will allow Eritreans to choose between independence and becoming part of Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a former Italian colony, Eritrea was entrusted to Ethiopian government control by the United Nations at the end of World War II. It was formally annexed in 1962 by Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie, sparking an independence campaign led by guerrillas of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military rulers who ousted Selassie in 1974 continued the war to stamp out the independence movement. Fighting continued until five months ago, when the forces of Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam collapsed before the combined advance of the EPLF and an anti-government coalition of Ethiopian groups which now administers a transitional administration in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of creating a functioning state in Eritrea is fraught with difficulties, not the least of which is the problem of economic viability in a territory the size of England with a third the number of people as London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some actions of the new administration have come under criticism.  There have been reports that Eritrean authorities refused to allow Addis Ababa-based diplomats to visit the territory and that relief workers from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other groups have been forced to leave, because they served in the capital, Asmara, when it was still held by the Ethiopian army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Press accounts of the weeks following the EPLF takeover told of Ethiopian families who lived in Asmara being forced to flee, leaving all their possessions behind. There were also stories that the surrendering Ethiopian soldiers from the Asmara garrison were force-marched back to Ethiopian lines without food or water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following eyewitness account of early nation-building efforts presents another view. It was written by Karen Hauser, development and outreach director of the New York-based Eritrean Relief Committee, which has been working with the EPLF to provide assistance to the territory since 1976. Hauser was one of a handful of foreigners in Eritrea from mid-July to mid-August, visiting towns, farms and health facilities, as well as water, reforestation and food distribution projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I arrived in Eritrea just six weeks after the end of the war and of Ethiopian rule -- an extraordinary, jubilant moment in Eritrea's history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The feeling of new freedom is palpable on the streets, in shops, and in homes. To a visitor it seems as if 3.5 million persons held hostage for a generation have suddenly been set free. There is an atmosphere of celebration: relief resonates in the air, joy lights every face. &quot;We are so happy now,&quot; are the first syllables of every greeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian administrators &quot;told us they would burn the city and leave only ashes behind,&quot; one Asmara woman said. &quot;We knew our children would come to free us, but sometimes we didn't know if we would survive until they got here.&quot; Living became like waiting to die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And still there is a sense of disbelief that their 30-year ordeal is over and that, in Asmara, (the Eritrean capital) the end came without bloodshed. &quot;Pinch me so I'll know I'm not dreaming,&quot; is a common refrain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On several occasions I witnessed truckloads of EPLF fighters arriving in Asmara from other areas. People spilled out of stores and homes to greet them with cheers. One afternoon I watched a convoy of trucks pass by from the fourth-floor balcony of a downtown hotel, and could see women, men and children jogging through the streets from blocks all around to join the welcome. The hotel housekeeper cried with joy as she leaned out the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outpouring was spontaneous, intimate, genuine. I was reminded of World War II film clips showing allied forces rolling into Nazi-occupied Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritrea is bouncing back to life like a garden blossoming in spring.  Within 48 hours of assuming control, the EPLF provisional government restored electricity throughout the city and began work to rehabilitate the municipal water system and intra-Eritrea long distance telephone service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government lifted the curfew and restrictions on travel. It released all political prisoners. It is establishing a system for returning private property that the Mengistu government had nationalized. Within a week, factories had resumed operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps most importantly, there are no longer trigger-happy Ethiopian soldiers standing at every corner and at the lookout posts built above every sidewalk. There is no longer need to fear for one's basic safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The high energy of freedom translates into a bustle of activity.  People are on the move everywhere. Mothers, fathers, children, and grandparents are taking pure delight in being able to go where they want, when they want, how they want, with whom they want. Every evening in Asmara, folks stroll down the boulevards with arms linked, stopping for coffee or fruit juice in the cafes that helped make the city famous, chatting in a way that cements the society on its most human level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cars, bicycles, donkeys, horses drawing carts and carriages, and castor-wheeled dollies called cuchinetas vie for space on the Asmara streets.  They compete with the pedestrians who still feel safer walking on the streets because the lovely patterned-tile sidewalks were frequently off limits -- in order to &quot;secure&quot; buildings with military sensitivity or any neighborhood where a ranking officer might have been visiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides, people still aren't too used to vehicles, as there had been no fuel for the previous year and a half. And bicycles -- because they could be used for 'subversive' activities -- were sometimes outlawed, and always ridden legally by no one but the owner, who had to carry the bicycle registration along with his identity card.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commercial activity had slowed considerably in the Ethiopian-controlled enclave over the past year and a half due to limited or unavailable electricity, fuel and raw materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With constraints lifted, urban markets that had been empty are now stocked with tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, onions, and fruits, among other foodstuffs, which farmers bring in fresh from the rural areas every morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In both urban and rural Eritrea, most people are deeply impoverished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Our country is free but she has been left naked,' one man said.  Outward signs of poverty are everywhere. In general people look haggard, even gaunt. It is common knowledge that some people do not eat every day. Many wear frayed and torn clothing. Beggars, including children, dot the streets. Too many people are crowded into small living spaces. In the market, old women and children scour the ground picking up fallen grains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poverty is striking to Eritreans returning home after many years abroad. They remember Asmara as a gleaming city whose residents strolled in bright white clothes, whose buildings were painted yearly by mandate of a municipal ordinance, whose sidewalk tiles were replaced the day they cracked, whose hardworking people were always working.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the severity of the recent droughts is clear.  Four fifths of the entire Eritrean populace is now surviving on external food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean Relief Association (ERA) -- the only private voluntary organization that operated in EPLF-controlled areas during the war -- is overseeing relief activities from its new Asmara headquarters. According to ERA's acting relief coordinator, the ERA to date has received 121,000 metric tons of food aid. This is only one third of the request for aid made before the end of the war for part of the population. The World Food Program and the European Economic Community have pledged help but there remains a serious deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ERA is maintaining no stockpiles of food aid; food is transported to distribution centers as soon as it arrives. &quot;There are many empty distribution centers,&quot; one ERA logistics coordinator lamented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ERA offices around the country are reporting to headquarters that their beneficiaries are running out of food. &quot;They are asking for more,&quot; said the acting relief coordinator, &quot;but we just don't have any more to send them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the ERA is trying to phase out its use of port facilities in neighboring Sudan so as to rely exclusively on Massawa, the Eritrean port city, as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All facilities at Massawa are in urgent need of repair. Most warehouses at the port were damaged in the fighting. The cranes need spare parts and the generators must be replaced. The deepwater frontage and docks need rehabilitation and associated roadways need resurfacing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The provisional government's economic development plans flow from those previously laid out by the EPLF. The new government clearly intends to cultivate a mixture of public and private ownership of economic resources. But it has inherited an infrastructure in which the previous government controlled all sectors -- including, for instance, the distribution and showing of entertainment films -- and planning for selective privatization will be a gigantic venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government planners have defined agriculture as the nation's highest development priority. Eighty percent of the Eritrean population lives directly off the land as farmers and herders. Helping them recover their self-reliance and improve their capacity for production are key to Eritrea's stability and to developing food security. The agricultural development policy is broad and will focus on rehabilitating damaged lands as well as providing seeds, tools and livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already, agricultural activities are in full swing, despite the setback caused by late rain. I found a powerful determination to cultivate wherever possible, whatever possible, however possible. If there was any chance that cereal or legume crops would grow, farm families were plowing and planting. Sometimes this meant taking the brave step of sacrificing food for seeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Livestock health appears to be poor. Most of the oxen I observed are quite thin; some are nearly skeletal. The grasses that sprouted with the recent rainfall have come just in time, and herd owners are working to bring back animals that seem on the brink of death. Many of the oxen I saw plowing were very weak for the job, and in one case the pair could barely keep moving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Landmines are a major problem. Sadly, war casualties are continuing even after the end of the war. Every day people trip some of the hundreds of thousands -- if not millions -- of landmines that the Ethiopian army left across Eritrea. Twenty to 25 persons with landmine injuries arrive at the Adi Caieh hospital each month. Most of them are children who were herding the family's animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health facilities throughout Eritrea are in poor shape. Visiting the Central Hospital in Asmara as an out-patient, I had to walk clear across the hospital grounds to find a usable lavatory. Ethiopian soldiers had filled the toilets with pebbles and stones to block the plumbing. The antiquated pharmacy had fewer supplies than any corner drug store in the U.S., and is in no way adequate to serve a modern urban population center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The physical reminders of conflict are ever-present. A drive along any of Eritrea's highways is an eery lesson in war's destructive power. Hulks of burned and destroyed tanks, armored personnel carriers, jeeps, and lorries litter the roads and adjoining fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shell casings and heavy demolition bomb fins are also scattered across the land. In areas near recent battles -- more precisely, at Ethiopian army positions -- there are sometimes piles of heavy gauge bullets and even hand grenades. One can also follow the trail of the Ethiopian army by the hills of empty ration tins it left behind -- which I saw in the south, in the west, and in the east, some rusted, some glinting in the sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highway scenes also include damaged and destroyed buildings -- pockmarked shops, churches and mosques, homes with just a wall or two standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A huge percentage of the buildings in Massawa are damaged or destroyed. One cannot walk for two minutes without seeing bombed structures.  Having no other option, residents still live and work in the damaged buildings. We ate in a small restaurant that also once included a bar. The waitress who delivered the hot spaghetti with spicy sauce passed through what used to be the game room on her way to the kitchen, walking past twisted metal supports jutting from the door-sized hole in the wall, under a ceiling fan swinging low from torn plaster, past rubble topping the billiard table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Asmara airport, unused bomb casings are still piled against the sides of small concrete bunkers, ready for loading. The Ethiopian army left this war like a cook walking out with dinner simmering on the stove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a strong nationalist element in the rejoicing over the end of Ethiopian rule. There is a clear sense of Ethiopia as &quot;the other.&quot; There is also a clear sense of Ethiopia as &quot;the enemy,&quot; an agent of unspeakable suffering. An important question, it seems to me, is whether this energy can be channeled into something positive. Can the concept of &quot;the enemy&quot; be transferred to underdevelopment, to poverty, to injustice, to illiteracy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EPLF/provisional government of Eritrea has treated Ethiopian civilians living in Eritrea and ex-soldiers with restraint and provided for them as well as possible given the resources available at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon returning from Eritrea, I was shocked and saddened to read press accusations of the provisional government &quot;expelling&quot; Ethiopians and mistreating the ex-soldiers it held as POWs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the situation with the Ethiopian ex-soldiers was far from ideal, I feel strongly that the international community needs to judge the EPLF according to full and contextually comprehensive information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 140,000 or more Ethiopian soldiers stationed in Eritrea, about 80,000 surrendered to the EPLF and the rest withdrew from Eritrea. Contrary to accusations, the EPLF provided transportation to every Ethiopian asked to leave Eritrea, civilian or military. No one was forced to walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commanding officers of the Ethiopian Army made no logistical arrangements for the retreat from Eritrea. While some officers rode in vehicles, the enlisted men embarked on a treacherous foot journey to the Sudan -- many days walk through semi-desert with no food or water. Hundreds of thousands of ex-soldiers perished. Although the EPLF and local communities had been burying the corpses, many still remained when I traveled along the road from Sudan. In places there were one or two bodies resting under the shade of almost every tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eritreans with whom I was traveling felt a mixture of rage and pity toward these dead soldiers. Looking at their uniforms one had to remember atrocities that the Ethiopian army committed in Eritrea -- the bombings, the bayonettings, the bestiality. But, as individuals, the dead evoked a deep sadness -- many were young conscripts, peasant boys whose lives were badly twisted into violence and who were ultimately betrayed by their leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Eritreans feel enmity towards the specific instruments of Ethiopian power in Eritrea. But there is also a sense of empathy with other Ethiopians, who also suffered under years of repressive governments. Most importantly, I found a great hope that the &quot;new Ethiopia&quot; will behave differently toward Eritrea, and that conditions would now allow for Eritreans and Ethiopians to get along and to trade with one another as good neighbors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's going much too far, scientists say, to pack malaria prophalaxis for a Florida or California vacation. Almost all the 1,100 malaria cases in the United States that were reported to the Centers for Disease Control last year were contracted abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, there are occasional incidents of malaria transmission to people who have not traveled overseas nor had blood transfusions. In San Diego, the county health department has conducted investigations into local transmission in each of the last three years, including an outbreak that struck 30 people in 1988. Many of those cases are attributed to poverty and lack of health care among temporary residents from malarious areas. But last year, a teenage boy living in a San Diego suburb and a woman in southern Florida were diagnosed with malaria, and researchers have been unable to trace the origins of either illness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some time, doctors have been concerned that the current spread of malaria to areas where it has never been seen before is a harbinger of its return to areas where it had been eradicated. In a global culture, no country can isolate itself completely from international health problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine cites the summer of 1989, when five Swiss citizens were diagnosed with malaria over a two-week period. All five lived within a mile of the Geneva International Airport and medical investigations suggested that the &quot;mini-epidemic&quot; was caused by stowaway mosquitoes on planes landing at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, the relative freedom from malaria is a newer phenomenon than many Americans realize. As recently as the early 1900s, there were 500,000 reported cases, mostly in the south, although earlier cases were widespread. Boston, for example, had a particularly severe epidemic in the 17th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, malaria was virtually eradicated from the U.S. in a five-year campaign ending in 1952 -- and for all practical purposes, that situation is likely to continue. While American travelers are increasingly at risk, the Centers for Disease Control's Dr. Hans Lobel predicts that cases transmitted within the U.S. will remain &quot;more a curiosity than a threat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria has made a dramatic worldwide resurgence in recent years, causing illness and death at almost unprecedented levels, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, according to scientists studying the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nearly 300 million people now infected with malaria is double the number of cases of a decade ago and the World Health Organization (WHO) says that more than half the world's population is facing a malaria threat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International efforts to eradicate the disease have waned, drugs no longer kill some species of the parasite and insecticides are increasingly ineffective on malaria-bearing mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook for controlling malaria &quot;is grim,&quot; says the National Academy of Sciences in a report released last month. &quot;Unless practical, cost-effective strategies can be developed and successfully implemented, malaria will continue to exact a heavy toll on human life and health around the world,&quot; the academy's Institute of Medicine says in &quot;Malaria: Obstacles and Opportunities.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Africa, this is particularly bad news. More than 85% of malaria deaths worldwide occur in Africa, says Dr. Richard Stecketee, the chief of malaria, epidemiology and control activity at the Centers for Disease Control's (CDC) malaria branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disease also threatens to bring Africa's children closer to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), says Robert Desowitz in his new book, &quot;The Malaria Capers.&quot; Blood for transfusions used to treat severe anemia caused by acute childhood malaria is often tainted with the virus that causes AIDS, says Desowitz, professor of tropical medicine and medical microbiology at the University of Hawaii.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, WHO called for renewed global action to fight malaria, and health experts from around the world met in Brazzaville, Congo, for the first of three regional conferences to begin discussing a strategy to combat the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Next October, government ministers from malaria-affected countries will meet in Amsterdam to discuss the regional recommendations and develop an international strategy to combat malaria's rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Carlos C. Campbell, the chief of the malaria branch at CDC, returned from the Brussels conference last week. He says that while there were no surprising initiatives during the five-day meeting, there were important discussions about how to fit malaria control efforts into the complex set of programs and priorities for Africa's future. Among the main topics of debate was the need for new treatment guidelines resulting from the spread of malaria strains resistant to chloroquine, currently the most widely used drug for both prevention and treatment. &quot;We can now show very clearly,&quot; Campbell says, &quot;that in many places we shouldn't be using chloroquine as a first-line therapy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria infects some 270 million people annually -- more than the entire population of the United States. Over two billion people are at risk of the disease in 120 countries, including 250 million in Africa alone, says Dr.  Hans Lobel, the chief of malaria surveillance for the CDC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria kills about 1.5 million people each year. Most are children and many have been infected with malaria several times before their first birthday, Lobel says. Survivors can build up a partial immunity to the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria -- from the Italian mal aria, or bad air -- may have surfaced as long as a million years ago, some experts estimate. Romans associated fevers with stagnant water holes, where mosquitoes breed, and pioneered swamp drainage. In modern times, malaria was considered &quot;the American disease,&quot; until the 1940s, according to Desowitz. Now the bane of the developing world, malaria is &quot;the most important disease of humans&quot; in terms of sheer numbers, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria is caused by a parasite that enters the blood through a mosquito bite and lodges in the liver. The parasite then attacks and bursts red blood cells, releasing more parasites and causing fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1957, WHO endorsed an extensive effort to wipe out the disease, including blanketing mosquito-infested areas with the insecticide DDT. It was during that decade that chloroquine was developed for widespread use as a prophylactic to prevent the disease and as a treatment to cure it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The availability of both a new drug and a potent insecticide fostered a widespread perception that malaria could be reduced as other tropical diseases such as yellow fever and typhoid had been. Infection dropped dramatically in less temperate zones and isolated island nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by 1961, after the world had spent $ 100 million dollars in eradication efforts the previous year alone. Health experts considered the magnitude of Africa's malaria problem and the lack of technological capability needed to carry out the effort insurmountable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody ever has proposed to eradicate malaria from Africa,&quot; says Lobel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africans are particularly vulnerable to malaria because the most dangerous of the four species of human malaria parasites, Plasmodium falciparum, thrives in tropical areas of the continent. Falciparum can lead to cerebral malaria that can develop rapidly and accelerate to convulsions, coma and death. Africa is also home to the virulent Anopheles gambiae mosquito that is becoming increasingly resistant to DDT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's all over the place&quot; in Africa, Lobel says of this mosquito. It needs little space to breed and can make a water-filled hoofprint or footprint its home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scientists and doctors agree that eradication is not the answer to fighting malaria today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can be done, but it is resource intensive,&quot; says Stecketee. &quot;In Africa, we're dealing with many places that are resource poor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More energy needs to be spent on research and controlling the disease, doctors say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Institute of Medicine suggests a range of actions: educating affected populations about treatment to prevent severe illness and death; promoting personal protection measures such as insecticide-treated bednets; encouraging community-wide mosquito control such as draining small bodies of water where mosquitoes breed; and considering higher cost measures such as large-scale insecticide spraying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Gambia, one recent experiment, with bednets impregnated with insecticide, reported in the British medical journal Lancet earlier this year, reduced child deaths from the disease by 70%. But, to be effective, the nets must be used properly and widely within communities. If not, unprotected people will be more likely to contract malaria because mosquitoes will be diverted to them, says WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi is one of the first countries experimenting with new measures to treat the disease. Instead of using chloroquine, it will administer sulfadoxine pyrimethamine. The program is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and is being implemented by the Malawi Health Ministry, says Stecketee. The new drug -- at 13 cents a dose compared to nine cents a dose for chloroquine -- nevertheless is inexpensive relative to other medicine available to treat malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other experiments underway, WHO and U.S. Army doctors have refined a drug that Chinese healers have used for 2,000 years -- an extract known as arteether from the quinghao plant -- to treat malaria. Tests are scheduled to begin in the Netherlands, but the remedy may not be ready for widespread use for another 10 years, WHO says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, scientists continue to pressure research on a malaria vaccine. Some steps have been made, but Lobel says: &quot;I think the picture is not very rosy, that's for sure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Stephen Hoffman, director of the malaria program at the Naval Medical Research Institute, is slightly more hopeful. &quot;We're making slow, steady progress and feel we will succeed,&quot; he says. &quot;The question of 'when' would be stupid to answer at this point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles Carpenter, the Institute of Medicine's malaria committee chairman, says because drugs and insecticides offer no permanent panacea, vaccines are particularly attractive. &quot;We're down to our last drugs,&quot; he says in the report. &quot;Fewer institutions are working in drug development, and research funding for that purpose is also dropping. The problem is only getting worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human test vaccines have protected only half of those immunized, according to a report in the May issue of Science News. And although a test vaccine completely protected a group of mice from infections, a human vaccine is far off, says Hoffman. &quot;It's a long jump from there to human vaccines, but it was a long jump just to get to mice,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan -- School enrollment in Toumanguie, a small village of 950 people about 80 miles from this West African metropolis, has dropped in each of the past two years. &quot;It has been very difficult for parents,&quot; says Jeanne Kamara Donontio, a nurse from the village who works in Abidjan but spends many weekends promoting develop-</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ment projects among Toumanguie's women. &quot;The farmers have not been able to send their children to school because they lack the funds for school fees, uniforms and notebooks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toumanguie's problems are a sign of the times in Cote d'Ivoire, a former French colony usually called 'the Ivory Coast' in English. Despite the fact that it has one of Africa's most developed economies, the country now finds itself in the grip of the serious recession that afflicts the entire continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there are indications that the painful economic reforms implemented by the government are winning some of the outside assistance needed to mitigate the crisis. A $ 113 million stand-by credit has been approved by theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and two major World Bank loans are expected to be finalized this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past decade, living standards in almost all of Africa have plummeted as a result of deteriorating trade terms, falling commodity prices and failed economic policies, many of them urged on African governments by a variety of foreign advisors. From 1980 to 1990, average real incomes in Africa dropped by more than 25%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resulting increase in human suffering has given new impetus to demands for an end to totalitarian rule in most of the continent's 54 countries and has spurred political changes in Africa on an unprecedented scale. Already this year, pro-democracy campaigns have forced at least 20 formerly autocratic regimes to hold elections, share power, or leave office. More than 30 countries are implementing some form of economic reform program supervised by the IMF and World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact of economic decline is evident in this seaside city of tall skyscrapers and wide boulevards. Although the modernity is striking in contrast to almost everywhere in Africa, signs of widespread deprivation are readily apparent. Unemployment is mounting, and living standards are falling for all sectors of the society. Average income is about $ 790, down from nearly $1,000 adecade ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immigrants and itinerant workers from throughout the region, who make up at least a quarter of the country's population of 12 million, have been especially hard hit by the slowdown, as has the large peasant population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sizeable middle class has felt the pinch as well. No longer able to afford many of the consumer goods that were once considered standard many now struggle to meet daily needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ivory Coast has been so prosperous, Ivorians have been so rich compared to all of our neighbors, they feel our conditions of living should be high no matter what happens,&quot; says Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara, a former International Monetary Fund official and central banker who was placed in the job a year ago by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to rescue the country from its crisis state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Houphouet-Boigny, who has governed since independence in 1960 and is Africa's longest-serving head of state, last year became one of the continent's first entrenched leaders to yield to pro-democracy demands when he legalized opposition parties and newspapers after several months of unprecedented strikes and demonstrations, just in time for constitutionally mandated elections in October and November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the president and his party won handily at the polls, the unrest died down. But the downward slide of the economy continued, as the prices of coffee and cocoa, Cote d'Ivoire's leading export earners, remained at record lows on the world market. Street protests resumed in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ouattara's efforts to restore the country's economic health have come up against some tough realities. It is difficult to implement the painful austerity measures required to win the support of international donors without fueling domestic dissatisfaction and alienating government supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ouattara says he has tried to secure popular approval for economic reforms by sending &quot;all kinds of signals&quot; that the government is shouldering its share of the hardship. The number of ministries has been reduced, limits have been placed on spending by government ministers and on the number of cars at their disposal. The civil service is being trimmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have tried to help our people understand that we have become poor because of the decline in raw materials prices, the decline in export receipts, and the decline in economic growth,&quot; the prime minister said in a lengthy interview reviewing his first year in office. &quot;We have to live within our means, but after being prosperous for 25 years, this is very difficult to achieve,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent breakthrough with the IMF has given Ouattara some much-needed operating space. Getting Fund support for the government's financial program was not easy, since Cote d'Ivoire has been unable to keep up its end of two other recent IMF agreements. But IMF approval was the necessary precursor to attracting assistance from other financial institutions and donor governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just days after the IMF arrangement was announced, the U.S. government gave the go-ahead for a new $ 23 million economic aid package for Cote d'Ivoire,primarily for a five-year health and family planning program. &quot;We know that Ouattara is an efficient technician and manager,&quot; says one senior U.S.  policymaker, interviewed by telephone in Washington, D.C. &quot;Whether the government will really tighten up and push ahead with what needs to be done remains to be seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the new World Bank loans will provide $ 200 million over two years for the government's financial program, while the other will finance human resource development and improved economic competitiveness. Half of the financial sector loan will come from a special World Bank fund, the International Development Association (IDA), which makes loans at below-market concessional rates for developing countries. Until this year, Cote d'Ivoire was not eligible for IDA lending, but Ouattara, during a visit to Washington in June, negotiated a reclassification based on the country's current economic difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To qualify for the IMF stand-by credit, the government has implemented a series of reforms, including a 25% reduction in government spending, privatization of the water and electricity companies, and cuts in customs duties and fees which have been seen as obstacles to trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cutbacks affecting the civil service are particularly sensitive, because of the presence of a large government bureaucracy inherited from the French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the &quot;multi-party timebomb exploded first&quot; in a relatively well-off country like Cote d'Ivoire, a recent Economist Intelligence Unit study suggests, could be attributable to the fact that economic downturn &quot;is felt more sharply&quot; by the middle class than by &quot;people in poorer African countries who are barely integrated within the money economy.&quot; A member of &quot;virtually every family&quot; in the Ivorian middle class is employed in the public sector, the study says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since Ouattara became prime minister, the economic situation has grown worse, not better,&quot; says Paul Arnaud, editor of the new Abidjan daily, Le Soir and the weekly Nouvel Horizon, which support the Ivorian Popular Front, the largest opposition party. &quot;The government is not competent to solve the problems our society faces,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With over 40 officially recognized political parties in the country and at least that many newspapers, government policies have become the leading target for commentators and cartoonists alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Criticism of the reforms has not been limited to the opposition.  Ouattara has also met with resistance from within the ruling party's old guard, which was more comfortable with the way things worked when the opposition was outlawed and the country's coffers were full. &quot;The government can no longer do just anything it wants,&quot; says one senior bureaucrat sympathetic to the reform efforts. &quot;Not everyone has been able to adjust very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, after a violent raid by police and army troops on a university dormitory, street demonstrations became an almost daily occurrence again, and strikes shut down schools and the national university. Pressure mounted within the ruling party for a crackdown on government opponents. Ouattara surprised many Ivorians with nationally televised speech that took a hardline position, outlawing the university student union and threatening striking teachers with dismissal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite angry opposition responses, President Houphouet-Boigny used the political skills he has often successfully employed through his long public career to persuade teachers and students to return to classes. The provisional truce lowered the political temperature and allowed final exams to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influx of new outside support and a reduction in domestic turmoil offer only a temporary respite from the problems Cote d'Ivoire faces. The national debt, accumulated during the late 1970s when cocoa and coffee prices were high, and inflated by U.S. dollar's climb in the 1980s, now exceeds $ 15 billion. The economy remains tied to the still-sagging fortunes of coffee and cocoa. And the cost of doing business here is so high that many investors take their money elsewhere, despite the attractive amenities and services available. A gallon of gasoline, for example, costs over $ 4.60, and fees for using the port of Abidjan are among the highest on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to diversify, and we have to improve our competitiveness,&quot; Ouattara says. &quot;We have a program to reduce all processing and production costs,&quot; he says, including water, electricity, customs duties and domestic taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with debt servicing assuming over 40% of export earnings and nearly 30% of the Gross Domestic Product -- and many of the country's obligations still unmet -- there is little left to finance recovery. The country has suffered a 40% drop in the terms of trade since 1986. Export earnings have fallen from $ 3.4 billion to about $2.8 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality is that we cannot pay the debt if we want the economy to survive,&quot; says Dr. Joseph Yao Yao, director of the center for economic research at the University of Abidjan. &quot;I think it is time to acknowledge that the debt burdens of countries like Cote d'Ivoire are too great and some relief must be found.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For commodity-growing villages like Toumanguie, relief is nowhere in sight. The cocoa and coffee farmers are sitting on unsalable stocks, and the empty desks in the small school are a mute testimony to the problems. Still, Kamara says her friends and family there refuse to give up. &quot;We think the future will be better,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The leader of Madagascar's opposition coalition has called for a general strike following Prime Minister Guy Razanamasy's announcement of a transitional government for the Indian Ocean island nation. Forces Vives leader Albert Zafy last Thursday told a rally of 20,000 people in the city center of Antananarivo that he disagreed with proposals announced at the end of October, when he was abroad, to end five months of political unrest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A series of sector-specific strikes which began in June eased somewhat at the end of October. At that time the opposition called for a general strike but then backed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The October 31 agreement between the government of President Didier Ratsiraka and the Forces Vives provided for a broad transitional government of national unity which was to be in power for up to 18 months. Zafy was named to head the temporary administration, but he has refused because Ratsiraka would remain armed forces commander under the agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ratsiraka, who has ruled Madagascar for 16 years, refused to step down last summer despite daily demonstrations calling for his ouster by hundreds of thousands of people in the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A referendum on a new constitution is to be held before the end of the year. It would include changes to electoral laws and would be followed by presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new team announced by Razanamasy last Wednesday mixes 24 politicians, including some opposition figures, with technocrats and military men.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost a year after Somalian rebels overthrew their aging dictator, Mohamed Siad Barre, the capital Mogadishu has become both a battlefield and a graveyard for rival factions fighting for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 70 and 100 people die from gunshot wounds in Mogadishu daily, doctors say, and every street is punctuated with scores of hastily-dug graves.  No national army exists and personal safety has become a matter of self-protection; even hospital patients are said to keep guns close at hand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations says the entire country is in ruins. More than half of the nation's 7.1 million people are hungry and destitute, says a recent report. Water supplies have been &quot;severely disrupted, destroyed and looted&quot; and most of the health system is in need of &quot;reconstruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Committee of the Red Cross has suspended relief supplies to southern and central Somalia, which are plagued by armed bandits and unrest. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said it is impossible to distribute food aid in the country for similar reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast, the breakaway northern region that calls itself the Republic of Somaliland appears to be faring better and relief and rehabilitation work is well under way, the United Nations says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the region's foreign minister, Yusuf Ali Sheikh Madar, appealed for foreign assistance and recognition for the northern territory during a recent visit to Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our unilateral declaration of the sovereign state of Somaliland is irreversible,&quot; he said. &quot;The Republic of Somaliland is not against negotiating with or talking to our southern brothers in Mogadishu, but given the continued factional fighting there is no credible representative leadership to talk to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July, six Somali rebel groups met in neighboring Djibouti to decide Somalia's fate. They hastily agreed to a mutual cease-fire and to joint efforts to defeat remnants of Siad's army which is inching towards the capital. Siad, who ruled the country for 21 years, is reportedly holed up in southern Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new government, led by Ali Mahdi Mohamed of the United Somali Congress (USC), has promised to halt the violence. But it is beset by internal rivalries and challenged by four other clan-based rebel groups, so it has no authority beyond Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid growing fears that widespread violence might overtake Zaire, the Bush administration has come under increasing pressure to cut remaining ties with President Mobutu Sese Seko. &quot;It has become nearly impossible to justify our continued implicit support for the corrupt, repressive, and incompetent regime,&quot; David Boren (D-OK), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a letter to National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft at the White House. Last Thursday, Scowcroft heard a similar appeal in an unannounced meeting with two long-time Zaire hands, Dr. William Close, Mobutu's former personal physician and Joe Gatt, a New Jersey businessman with investments in the central African nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on November 6, Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen said the U.S. believes Mobutu still has an important political role, even though the president &quot;has lost the legitimacy to govern.&quot; Cohen called for a transitional administration drawn from &quot;the ranks of the opposition&quot; and said the new government must &quot;guarantee the president's personal safety and his right to participate in the democratic process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But critics of the current policy call it a formula for disaster.  Testifying the same day, Nancy Warlick, a Presbyterian missionary who has served in Zaire for 16 of the past 26 years, called for the U.S. to &quot;publicly break its ties&quot; with Mobutu. &quot;Each day that he remains in power moves the country closer to anarchy,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearing was chaired by Illinois Democrat Paul Simon and was attended by Republicans Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Richard Lugar of Indiana -- all three of whom have asked for a firmer U.S. stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fears of spreading trouble were heightened by several incidents last week, most notably an attack on the home of Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, who has been tapped as a possible mediator in the current stalement between Mobutu and the opposition. Monsengwo was thought to be the most likely choice to chair the national conference, which has been stalled by procedural disagreements and charges that Mobutu was trying to stack the meeting in his favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, two key West African countries have sought to mediate the dispute. Nigerian Foreign Minister Ike Nwachukwu visited Zaire ten days ago, and last week Senegal's minister of state, Abdoulaye Wade, was in Kinshasa, the Zaire capital. Wade is a leading Senegalese opposition figure who joined Senegal's cabinet earlier this year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rwandan war is threatening the safety of the country's rare mountain gorillas. But conservationists say that rudimentary snares set in the rainforest by Rwandan villagers are proving more of a danger than the stray bullets of rebels and soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with growing food shortages because of the fighting, villagers near the Volcanoes National Park along the Ugandan border have set up snares to trap antelope.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been an enormous increase in poaching in the rainforest,&quot; says Pam O'Malley, resource assistant for the Digit Fund, a Colorado-based non-profit group carrying on the research of zoologist Dian Fossey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fossey, who was mysteriously slain in Rwanda at the Karisoke research center in 1984, founded the organization in the name of one of her favorite gorillas, Digit, who himself was killed by a poacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Malley says that none of the 310 mountain gorillas -- the last of their kind in the world besides a small group believed to live deep in Uganda's Bwindi Forest -- were shot, but one gorilla group has become &quot;more agitated&quot; because of the noise of the weapons and is no longer as welcoming to researchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Snares are a bigger threat. Early this year, conservationists cut down 150 of the wire traps in one week in the area inhabited by the gorillas; normally about a dozen snares a week are found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least four gorillas have been caught in snares this year, compared to none in 1990, says the Digit Fund. All have recovered with the help of veterinarians, but one male lost his hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of gorillas which disappeared in January turned up later in Zaire, says O'Malley. The animals usually wander throughout the rainforest, located in a chain of seven extinct volcanoes called the Virunga Mountains in Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire. But the fighting appears to have made the gorillas even more mobile, says O'Malley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Craig Sholley, former director of the Mountain Gorilla Project, says Rwandan rebels invaded Volcanoes Park in January. Fortunately, he says, only 25 mountain gorillas live in the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everybody still is extremely concerned&quot; because fighting is ongoing at the Rwanda-Uganda border, says Sholley, who left Rwanda in February. The Mountain Gorilla Project was turned over to the Rwandan government last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourist visits to the gorillas ceased when the fighting began in October, he says, but infrequent trips to one group resumed in September. Such visits are essential to the Rwandan economy, which has already taken a beating from the costs of war, says Sholley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says Volcanoes Park brought in over $ 1 million in 1989, and tourism associated with the gorillas that year was between $ 6 million and $10 million -- second only to coffee and tea exports in earning foreign currency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Rwanda is a very, very natural resource deficient country,&quot; says Sholley. &quot;Tourists who come to Rwanda come for one reason: gorillas. If they can't see gorillas, they don't come.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Heavy fighting this month between rebels and government soldiers in Rwanda indicates that the country's year-long conflict is far from a resolution, despite attempts to move towards democracy and to solve a growing refugee problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) said it had advanced 32 miles inside Rwanda from Uganda on November 3 and killed more than 40 soldiers. The Rwandan government said its troops killed more than 100 RPF rebels November 10 after repulsing a third attack in less than two weeks. State-owned Radio Rwanda said the insurgents had been driven back into Uganda &quot;and will never capture even an inch of Rwandan territory.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Apparently this was a very serious battle -- both sides admit,&quot; says one U.S. analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity. She says November's fighting was the worst in several months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a year ago, thousands of armed refugees invaded Rwanda from Uganda in an effort to push their way back home and force President Juvenal Habyarimana out of office. The fighting spurred troops from Belgium and France to rush to the government's rescue temporarily, but by February the struggle had subsided and a cease-fire was agreed to in March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is unclear just how bad the fighting is today because both sides in the conflict have a reputation for using the media for propaganda and intimidation. But what is clear, ironically, is that the war that began over the refugee problem continues to push Rwandans living near the Ugandan border out of their homes, according to Amnesty International. The human rights group says 100,000 people have been displaced because of fighting mainly in the mountainous northern region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while international attention on the tiny overcrowded country that once promoted itself as the &quot;Switzerland of Africa&quot; has diminished, Rwanda is still reeling politically and economically from the October invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RPF rebels, who are mainly former Ugandan army soldiers of Rwandan Tutsi descent, accuse Habyarimana, a Hutu, of undemocratic and corrupt practices and say his regime reserves most educational and vocational opportunities for a small clique from the north, the president's home region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habyarimana legalized multiparty politics in Rwanda in June and says elections are to be held by late next year, but he refuses to hold a national conference similar to those that a half-dozen other African countries have used to make the transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a prime minister designated in October is working on forming an &quot;all-party transitional government,&quot; the analyst said. Rwanda now has six new parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much of the political conflict can be attributed to long-standing ethnic tension between the Tutsi minority that had oppressed the Hutu majority for 500 years. German and Belgian colonizers concentrated power and wealth in Tutsi hands and introduced a segregated education system that blocked Hutu mobility and advancement. In the early 1960s, thousands of Tutsis fled to Uganda after the Hutus seized power in Kigali, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the refugee problem that sparked the October 1990 uprising.  Rwanda produces Africa's seventh largest number of refugees, just behind war-ravaged Angola, which is almost 10 times its size, according to the U.N.  World Refugee Survey. An estimated 323,900 Rwandans now live in neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Habyarimana has contended that his country cannot absorb all the Rwandans who are in Uganda, Tanzania, Zaire, Kenya and Burundi. He has asked leaders to accept some of the exiles as immigrants. Uganda, where an estimated 207,000 of them live, has refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent conflict has also heightened tension between the Rwanda and Uganda governments. Rwanda has accused Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni of backing the RPF. Most of the RPF's leaders are former exiles who served in Museveni's guerrilla force which seized power in 1986. These leaders were serving in Uganda's army until the time of the invasion. Museveni has denied Rwanda's charges and has called for more troops to join an Organization of African Unity (OAU) observer force along the border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional leaders, including Organization of African Unity chairman Ibrahim Babangida and Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, have tried to bring peace to Rwanda, but to little avail. The leader of the Rwandan Association for Defense of Human Rights, Nkubito Alphonse Marie, says government and RPF leaders have begun holding meetings but the sessions have proved fruitless so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie was demoted from his job as a magistrate in the capital to a provincial judicial post for refusing to keep a group of suspected RPF sympathizers in jail, saying there was no evidence against them. Marie, who says he is apolitical, believes a national conference is the only way to solve Rwanda's problems. &quot;All the vital forces of the country, as a matter of principle, should say what they think about the future of the country, including the Patriotic Front,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marie notes that the RPF is no longer the only opposition group and its conduct will be weighed against other government opponents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a recent visit to the United States to seek support for his organization, to learn about the U.S. judicial system and to talk with human rights groups, Marie emphasized that Rwanda's problem is regional because so many Rwandan refugees are living in neighboring countries. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) appears to agree. It is conducting surveys of Rwandan refugees, asking them if they want to return to Rwanda, to retain a passport and just be allowed to visit, or to remain where they are and become nationalized, the U.S. analyst said. UNHCR is to present its results to a donor conference next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The analyst said the Rwandan government is working on plans to locate sites within Rwanda to bring at least some of the refugees home. About 18,000 Rwandan refugees have returned from Tanzania since March 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently have sent missions to Rwanda to assess the country's economic damage from the war.  Officials do not yet know how much the economy has suffered, but they say structural damage has been limited because fighting has been isolated in northern plains and mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the World Bank's annual report for 1991 says Rwanda experienced negative growth last year. &quot;In Rwanda, the recent civil hostilities resulted in extensive damage to the infrastructure and increased defense expenditures,&quot; the report says. In addition, the price of coffee -- which accounts for about 90% of Rwanda's exports -- hit an all-time low in 1990. The country's gross domestic product declined by almost three percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the World Bank says Rwanda's neighbors, Uganda and Burundi, seem to be having more success, despite their own problems with a rebel insurgency and ethnic tension respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda, fighting back a rebel incursion from the north, has remained a strong, consistent economic reformer since 1987, and its growth performance continues to be impressive, according to the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi, whose governing Tutsi slaughtered an estimated 60,000 Hutu in 1988, has also been successfully pursuing a long-standing adjustment program, the World Bank says. Its growth rate was been over 4.5 percent during 1980-89.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A year after he was sworn in as president of the interim government in Liberia, Amos Sawyer remains hopeful that he will see the end of the &quot;nightmare&quot; that his country has experienced. Sawyer was tapped to head the transition team during a meeting of a broad range of Liberian organizations convened in neighboring Gambia by west African governments in August 1990.  Ecowas, the Economic Community of West African States, has been working on a settlement of the two-year Liberian conflict and has placed a peacekeeping force, known as Ecomog, inside Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer, a university professor forced into exile in the United States in the mid-1980s by President Samuel K. Doe, had expected his tenure in office to be over by now. The peace plan drawn up at the Gambian meeting called for a one-year transition to elections and precludes the interim president from being a candidate. Sawyer says he never aspired to be president but is willing to remain in office until the transition to democracy has been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Sawyer was selected, Doe was still in power and rebel forces headed by Charles Taylor were closing in on the capital, Monrovia. After Ecomog took charge in Monrovia -- and Doe was killed by rival revel leader Prince Johnson -- Sawyer and his government assumed the administration of a devastated nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Taylor refused to recognize or cooperate with Sawyer, whose control was limited to the capital and surrounding areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a revised peace plan now in place, placing Ecomog in command of border posts, checkpoints, and air and sea ports throughout the country, the prospects for an end to the year-long stalemate have risen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sawyer is facing another challenge: the continued refusal of a new rebel army -- the United Liberation Movement (Ulimo) made up of former Doe supporters opposed to Taylor -- to surrender their arms. Ulimo has been attacking Taylor's forces inside Liberia from bases in neighboring Sierra Leone, and Taylor has threatened to scuttle the new peace plan unless the attacks stop. Senegalese Foreign Minister Djibo Ka pledged last week that all factions, including Ulimo, will be disarmed -- either &quot;voluntarily or by Ecomog.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, during a visit to the United States Amos Sawyer discussed his views of the current situation with Africa News. Here are excerpts from the conversation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: As you know, many Liberian refugees have been deeply disappointed by the difficulty of getting visas to come to the United States. Is this something that concerns you?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: Well, we were hoping that there would be more sympathetic consideration on the part of United States officials regarding the entry of Liberians. You know, it's rather difficult psychologically for Liberians, because Liberians see New York or Washington, DC, in the same way that the Francophones see Paris or the Anglophones see London.  And, what Liberian can you find that does not have a relative or a friend who has either studied here or been here? One would hope that in a time of distress, the United States would be more accommodating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I can understand what the American immigration people have outlined as the problem. But we hope that for those refugees who cannot come here, the United States government will support UNHCR (the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) so that better care can be taken of our people where they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: In general, what role would you like to see the United States be playing in the Liberian crisis now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: I think there are three things the United States needs to do to help the process on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is a little bit more substantial support for the peacekeeping effort.  They've already provided $ 3.7 million and we welcome that. But we'd like a little bit more because it is an expensive proposition, especially for countries (providing the peacekeeping forces) like The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secondly, we would like United States support for the elections process.  We have agreed on elections, we look forward to setting up the appropriate machinery for elections, and we look forward to international supervision. This can be expensive.  We would like the United States to play a role in supporting this process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirdly, there's a repatriation program. About a third of our people are outside of the country now. We'd like to have them come back home. We are told by UNHCR that, prior to elections, there is a need for some $ 62 or $65 million for this repatriation package.  That money has to come from somewhere.  We'd like some support on that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I'm saying to the United States government, &quot;We think you're headed in the right direction now, but, in addition, we'd like you to look down the road.  There is the problem of reconstruction that we're going to have to face as soon as elections are over.  We'd like you to be ready to help us at that point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So this is the package, this is the message, we try to bring along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Do you think it is realistic to believe that the hundreds of thousands of Liberians who have fled the country will return before they can be guaranteed a secure future for themselves and their families? How will you persuade them to come back before elections take place?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: I think that there are serious fears and reluctance. The propaganda against Ecomog (the West African peacekeeping force), has taken its toll, and many people have been nervous about Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think now we find that the truth is coming out, and there is wider acceptance of Ecomog, even in the interior of Liberia. We believe that once there is an indication that Ecomog has taken control of security, border posts, ports of entry, normal security, checkpoints, all of these, there will be a greater inflow of people. True there may not be a stampede, but we think there will be a most substantial inflow, sufficiently so that one could have valid elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Liberians spend a lot of time talking about the &quot;special relationship&quot; with the United States, and you touched on that when you mentioned the family ties.  Aside from that, is there a special relationship between our two countries, and, if so, how do you define it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: There is a special relationship; whether it has an emotive quality to it or not is a different matter.  But the historical ties and linkages are there, and there is nothing we can do to erase those.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now whether they mean anything at this point is where we have a problem, because Liberians have had high expectations, because of the special relationship.  Because of the special relationship, Liberians expected that the United States would come to the rescue in this crisis, at the early stages.  When the Marines arrived offshore, there was this anticipation that, well, this nightmare is over. And it wasn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we have seen that the special relationship has been defined in a new sense, which is to play a supportive role to Liberia, as Liberia is now seen in the context of the West African sub-region. So, what of the new bilateral relationship that will emerge between the United States and Liberia?  It may be a second-order relationship to Liberia's relationship within the West African sub-region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way, this is a big thing for us Liberians, because we have come to grips with ourselves within the context of our own geographical and socio-economic milieu.  And I think we will be a stronger people for that, a more self-reliant people for that, and will develop concentric circles of relationships in which the West African ones would form our priorities, and then, perhaps, after those, would come the larger relationships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: There are those who say that after what Liberia has gone through, there's really very little hope for the country for a long time to come. Would you disagree with that?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: Well, I do disagree. I think Liberians are doing some serious assessments of ourselves and of our relationships one to the other. We're doing a serious assessment of inter-ethnic relationships. We all have been glad to admit, for once, there's hardly any economic or class difference. Everybody is impoverished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we are also beginning to do an assessment of our possibilities, and we're becoming more modest people. We will become more appreciative of our own resources, individual as well as the social resources in this society. We will set our sights more modestly, and, perhaps -- I hope -- we will work more conscientiously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We probably had an inflated perception of ourselves on the West coast.  You know, we have this thing -- even now when we're down! -- that this is supposed to have been the New York of West Africa. We expected people to come running in and enjoy themselves in Monrovia.  We had more things in our shops than they had in Freetown, and we were supposed to be the super-sophisticates in the region; we were in tune with Western culture, and all that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we realize that there is much more to being, and to becoming, than just being Western in values and taste. I think we'll be better off for this realization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: In contrast to that image of Monrovia and Liberia, the picture that's been coming across since the war began, in our media -- especially the few television reports -- have been very graphic in their presentation of a barbaric society where people go about cannibalizing each other, torturing each other, cutting off each other's body parts. How does that square with the Liberia you know?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: Well, that is the shocker, and that is where we have now seen another side of ourselves. We are shocked that we have it in us to go to this extent of brutality one to the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So I think that is going to force us into a more modest estimation of ourselves, and perhaps, a real assessment of those institutions and values that we thought we had. I still cannot put my finger on it, except, perhaps, we've done too much with the superficial, and assumed that our own aspirations of a sophisticated society were not being based on firm foundations. (We thought) our educational system, our religious values, were perpetrating messages of brotherhood and sisterhood that were coming across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now we have to face facts about the big ethnic divide that had, for so many years, taken the better part of our politics and power relations. The slogans of inclusion were, in fact, being translated into reality, but not fast enough.  So we have the bare facts now; we have to build.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Given all this, what you've just gone through, how can the country pull together now and have an election in a few months?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer: Yeah, that's a tall order. But you see, we have to find a way.  And I think, first, we have a way because the country is war-weary. Nobody wants to fight anymore. Two, there's a realization that behind all of this conflict, there's this struggle for power, and a prolongation of it is not necessarily the way to find a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think there is a view that if we can correct the problems as they've developed, not over the centuries, but just as of 1985, that might give us a good start.  And, therefore, if we can have free and fair elections this time, we're not going to solve the age-old problem, but we have a lesson before us that a new regime would know to be more careful in its construction of the military, that the bar association has been burned by the crisis, and should therefore know that it ought to strive to be more assertive, that the press should be more watchful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the institutional levels, we might begin with the empowerment of these institutions through the electoral process, and through the attitudes of the new regime. That will be the first order of business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, over time, we can attack the more serious underpinnings of attitudes and values that have not gone right over the years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">816 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last Friday, West African peacekeepers began implementing a new agreement designed to end the conflict in Liberia. The plan calls for an expansion of the West African peacekeeping force to all areas of the country and the holding of elections in the middle of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was worked out late last month in the latest of a long series of regional summits aimed at bringing peace to Liberia. The meeting, hosted by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny in the Cote d'Ivoire capital Yamoussoukro, set a six-month timetable for election preparations to begin on November 15, which the agreement calls &quot;D-Day.&quot; In attendance at Yamoussoukro were the presidents of Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, and Senegal, the prime minister of Togo, and senior ministers from Nigeria, Sierre Leone, the Gambia, Ghana, and Guinea. All are members of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement was signed by the participating governments as well as by the president of the interim government of Liberia, Amos Sawyer, and Charles Taylor, leader of the rebel movement known as the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the first time, the leaders got Taylor to agree to disarm his forces, which control about 90 percent of the territory. Within 60 days of D-Day, all armed factions are to turn in their weapons and report to camps that are being established by the west African peacekeeping force, Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor has always resisted any cooperation with Ecomog, which has been dominated by Nigerian troops and which Taylor has seen as hostile to his aspirations to be president of Liberia. To win Taylor's cooperation, the West African leaders have added two new nations to the previously six-nation force.  About 450 soldiers from Senegal were ferried to Liberia just before the summit opened and the rest of the 1,500-member contingent are slated for arrival before the year's end. The troops are being transported in U.S. military planes and are receiving American logistical assistance. Guinea-Bissau has also agreed to send soldiers to join Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of the Yamoussoukro accord have been spelled out in the following &quot;program of implementation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ecomog Mission is to cover the whole of Liberia and to supervise the encampment and disarmament of all warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Preliminary Accepted Conditions:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* During the period of encampment and disarmament, eminent persons of the International Negotiating Network (headed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter) will visit Liberia in order to reinforce the confidence of the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All parties concerned will recognize the absolute neutrality of Ecomogand demonstrate their trust and confidence in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Some weapons would be inadvertently be lost and would therefore need to be located and recovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* There would be some obstacles and possible minefields that would need to be neutralized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All entry points into Liberia would be monitored by Ecomog groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tasks:</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Monitoring of all possible avenues of approach into Liberia by patrols and static guards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Search, in conjunction with administrative authorities, to recover hidden or lost weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Strategic installations will need static guards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">YU-JAY'S STORY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">698 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By the age of 14, Yu-Jay Harris had survived a war that chased him from his home in Monrovia, separated him from his mother, and deposited him with his 12-year-old brother Jared in an unfamiliar rural environment. The sight of dead bodies became commonplace, but staring into the barrels of guns, some wielded by children their own age, remained terrifying. His experiences, Yu-Jay says, have given him a confidence in his ability to cope and a new compassion for the people around him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both brothers project an innocent sweetness that belies the horrors they have seen. Jared's shy smile masks a thoughtful seriousness that emerges under patient questioning. Yu-Jay, more voluble, is a ready spokesman for the two, fielding inquiries with a disarming wit and a penetrating intelligence.  When he gets excited, his precise articulation slides towards &quot;Liberian English,&quot; a colorful, expressive dialect that challenges unfamiliar listeners with its dropped consonants and slap-dash speed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, in his own words, are some of Yu-Jay's experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On fleeing from his house:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the frightening things was when the army of President Doe came and broke the house and put everyone of us inside. They ransacked our house, took all the things we had and decided they were going kill us. But, as God had it, the forces (of rebel leader Charles Taylor) were starting to shoot. So my mother started begging them to let us go before we got caught in a crossfire.  They hurried to take all the things they can and then they let us go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On being a city kid in the Liberian countryside:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I thank God (for helping me grow up) because I felt I was like a baby at home -- someone to wash my clothes, clean the house, even though I used to do a little work. And I was so used to my Ma, I couldn't let her go far from me -- like one little baby! But I just feel like this experience makes boys like us, who will have to be dependent on ourselves one day, know how to depend on ourselves. When I came, no one could help me wash my clothes, I had to take care of myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just imagine me taking a cutlass -- about three boys trying to brush an acre or two to make a cassava farm to have something to eat. We used to walk five, six, seven hours. I never thought!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes we had to go and take some cassava stakes from another farm -- that's about an hour walk -- put it on our head, and then we will bring it back to our farm. We had to pass through swamp water. I was so afraid. I said, &quot;What? Leeches and things will be in the water, they will stick on me and I will get injured badly. &quot;But there were guys who were used to it because they live in it. And they just passed through and I had to pass through or fall in the water, stakes and all. I was so weak until they were vexed, telling me, &quot;You're too lazy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I said, &quot;My man, you know, I'm not used to this kind of thing.&quot; I said they shouldn't tell me that I'm lazy, because I have the strength to do the thing. But the thing is that I never tried it before, it's my first time getting to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On plans and prayers:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When I see sick people I feel like being a doctor. I didn't plan on being a doctor, but I feel like being a doctor, because to see your fellow man suffering...I felt that if I kept on seeing such a thing I would be a doctor or do something that other people would benefit from. I would help or be able to take care of my fellow human beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I hope that the war will finish and our country will rebuild and there will be peace and stability. Many people, they think they can pray to get out.  But you shouldn't pray you can leave the country and forget about the other people, because some people don't have the way to leave. Those people far in the villages, good, good people, they can't go. And people who have PhD's, they are making farm for a living, they can't get out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best thing is just continue to pray that the war will finish, that school may resume and things will become normal, because if you keep on praying, &quot;Hey, God, please get me out of this war,&quot; then how about the other people? I don't think that's a fair prayer. So I just wish that the war will finish.  n</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan -- U.S. consular officer Steve Voien grimaced as Liberian refugee Rosetta Goweh started to cry. &quot;Ah, please,&quot; he said, through the speaker in the security glass that separated them. &quot;Please don't do that to me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voien and his colleagues at embassies in West Africa have been facing a refugee crisis they feel has been largely ignored by U.S. policy makers.  &quot;Being out here on the front line,&quot; Voien says, &quot;we wish that there was something in the law that would at least allow us to reunite families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since a rebel army invaded Liberia on Christmas eve of 1989, over two million Liberians -- more than half the country's population -- have fled their homes.  Over 300,000 crossed the border to Cote d'Ivoire. The embassy here, like those in Sierra Leone and Guinea, Liberia's other neighbors, has been besieged by refugees seeking American visas. Most of them are turned down.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result is a profound bitterness towards the United States that spans the traditional class and political divisions among Liberians. In travels around Cote d'Ivoire, the frontier area where refugees are concentrated, to villages scattered throughout the country, it is impossible to meet a Liberian without being asked why the United States has betrayed Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That attitude is rooted in historical reality, as well as in resentment over present policies. Founded by freed American slaves in 1822, Liberia often appeared to be an outpost of Americana in Africa. Many Liberians have family in the U.S., and the elite has always sent its children to be educated in American schools. U.S.-made products filled the stores, U.S. tunes dominated the music scene, the red, white and blue -- with 11 stripes and a lone star -- hung from flagpoles, and U.S. dollars were legal tender. Even Liberians who had no personal ties to the United States tended to think of it as &quot;the motherland.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberians have always looked to the U.S.,&quot; says Joyce Mends-Cole, a Liberian attorney who is a consultant to the United Nations Development Fund for Women. &quot;But now we find,&quot; she says, &quot;that the 'special relationship' has been special only to Liberians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the years of the Cold War, though, Liberia was a friend the U.S.  could count on. The U.S. military had rights to use the country's international airport. The Voice of America built one of its biggest transmitters near Monrovia. In return, in the decade from 1975 to 1985, Liberia garnered the largest per capita amount of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa and hosted the largest Peace Corps contingent on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, when fighting among rival factions began to tear the country apart after the overthrow of the regime of President Samuel Doe, Liberians expected the U.S. to step in to stop the conflict. The fact that the U.S. limited its intervention to the evacuation of its nationals has been an additional element in Liberian resentment over U.S. policy. In September 1990, the West African peacekeeping force Ecomog secured the capital, Monrovia, but the country remains divided into armed camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenneth Brown, the U.S. ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, says that the United States continues to recognize a special historic and cultural relationship with Liberia, but says Congress has not extended that specialness to immigration policy. &quot;What we have to keep in mind,&quot; he says, &quot;is that the consular officer works within a law legislated by Congress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under current law, visa applicants must satisfy the embassy that they will return to their own countries when their visitors' visas expire.  &quot;Unfortunately, the applicant is guilty until proven innocent,&quot; Brown says. &quot;If you've fled a country where a war is going on, it becomes difficult to convince somebody that you will go back to that country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February, after intense pressure from human rights groups like the New York-based Africa Watch, then-Attorney General Richard Thornburgh announced that the Immigration and Naturalization Service would issue temporary visa extensions to nationals of Liberia who were already in the U.S., as well as to citizens of Kuwait and Lebanon. While welcoming the action, Africa Watch argued that it did nothing to relieve the plight of most Liberians, including those who have arrived more recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor can many Liberians expect to enter the U.S. as refugees. Each year, the administration proposes and Congress approves a cap on refugee admissions by region, and Africa is low on the list. Although the continent accounts for a third of the world's 15 million refugees, less than 5% of those admitted to the U.S. in a typical year are African. The largest number of refugees by far come from the Soviet Union and Asia, at about 50,000 each. This year's ceiling for Africa is 4,900 -- a limit that refugee organizations are protesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think race plays a very serious role,&quot; says Beverlee Bruce, a former Peace Corps director in Liberia, who visited West Africa in April and May as part of a fact-finding team from the New York-based Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. &quot;I think the official American community thinks Liberians would just be additional black people who would exacerbate an already difficult situation in America's urban ghettos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Princeton Lyman, the State Department's director of refugee programs, says that the administration is responding to criticism that the Africa ceiling is discriminatory. &quot;In fact,&quot; he says, &quot;our numbers have gone from 3,000 just a few years ago to over 4,000 now, and we are projecting even more for the coming year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hiram Ruiz, of the U.S. Committee for Refugees in Washington, says that actual admissions don't always reach the ceiling levels. In 1986, for example, the ceiling was 3,500, but only 1,315 Africans were admitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even if as many Africans as the law allows are admitted this year, the increase is small comfort to consular officers who deal with the Liberian caseload. The job is an emotional ordeal, they say, because the applicants are so desperate and their numbers overwhelm the embassy's capacity to interview and process them. Every refugee tells stories of terror and death, and the majority are still trying to locate missing family and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rosetta Goweh's case differs from others only in its particulars. She fled Monrovia with her two sons and other family members, after soldiers ransacked her house and prepared to shoot all the inhabitants. In a reprieve that Goweh attributes to the miracle of answered prayer, rival forces chose that moment to invade the neighborhood. Crawling to avoid the crossfire, the family escaped to the home of friends in another town, although Goweh was hampered by a severely injured leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned with Goweh's worsening condition, friends and family pooled their resources to pay for an airplane ticket to the U.S. and to bribe rebels to take her across the border into Cote d'Ivoire. As a clerk at the U.S.  embassy in Monrovia, Goweh had visited the U.S. and already had a visa.  &quot;Leaving my boys was the hardest thing I ever did,&quot; she says, &quot;but I thought that if I died I would not be able to help them anyway.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the financial assistance of a church group in Charlotte, North Carolina, Goweh had extensive surgery that left a temporary pin in her leg, and she began trying to get her boys out of Liberia. But by then chaos had spread to every part of the country, and all she learned from the efficient refugee communication network was that her friends' town was decimated and its residents scattered. The Charlotte group bought her a roundtrip ticket to travel to Cote d'Ivoire to look for her children, aged 12 and 14. &quot;I prayed that they were alive,&quot; she says, &quot;but I feared they were dead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she arrived at the embassy in Abidjan three weeks later with sons Jared and Yu-jay in tow, Goweh couldn't stop smiling -- until she met with Steve Voien. She had to have surgery to remove the pin from her leg, she told him, and she couldn't and wouldn't leave the boys again. She said friends in Charlotte would support the family until they could return to Liberia. The longer Goweh cried the more pained Voien looked, but the response remained the same: no visas for the boys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's real human drama,&quot; says Ambassador Brown. &quot;No one with any feeling wants to turn away people who have gone through what the Liberian refugees have gone through. And that's particularly true when they are from a country that we have a special affinity for. But if there is to be greater flexibility, then we need greater guidance from Washington.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary Anne Schwalbe, staff director of the Women's Commission, says such flexibility would be a good investment for future U.S. relations with Liberia. The Commission recommends more visa approvals, increased humanitarian assistance to refugees in West Africa, and greater U.S. help in tracing the large number of separated families. &quot;In most refugee situations, people flee with their families,&quot; she says. &quot;In Liberia, the situation was so fluid that people could be in different parts of town when fighting started and never see each other again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has provided $ 130 million in aid to Liberian refugees. But Schalwbe says that without additional assistance, conditions will continue to deteriorate. Already, malnutrition, disease and prostitution are spreading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the difficult physical conditions, Schwalbe says, she has been struck by Liberians' pleas for printed materials and textbooks. &quot;They are starving intellectually,&quot; she says. &quot;Unlike many refugee populations who want lots of other things first, most of the people we've spoken to here want schooling for their children and books to read.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claude Regnier, who coordinates refugee programs for the Ivorian government, says more help is needed urgently. When the first flood of refugees poured across the border, he says, African hospitality ensured a sympathetic welcome. &quot;But when there are more than 300,000,&quot; he says, &quot;they are too numerous for Ivorian resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regnier says that even with United Nations and other international aid, there is not sufficient housing, food, water or medical care for the Liberians. The growing pressure on the land is becoming a source of tension between local and refugee communities. &quot;In certain host areas, Ivorians don't have enough land for themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;That's the problem.&quot; Some border villages have swollen to ten times their previous size, with nine Liberians to every Ivorian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regnier estimates that Cote d'Ivoire can continue to accommodate only 20% of its current population of refugees without facing serious social repercussions of its own.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education for refugee children remains a serious problem. Ivorian schooling is in French, a language foreign to Liberians. And the establishment of English-language schools has become a delicate political issue. In one border town, a school run by refugee teachers was closed because of community resentment over the shortage of local schools for Ivorians. &quot;We have studied the problem,&quot; says Regnier. &quot;But it is difficult and there is a certain danger for the future. The only solution is to reopen Liberian schools inside Liberia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last month, that possibility seems more promising, as a West African peace initiative backed by the Carter Center in Atlanta appears to be gaining ground. The plan calls for holding internationally-supervised elections six months from now (see page 10).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joyce Mends-Cole says that the United States has an obligation to ensure Liberia's future by strong and immediate support for the peace process.  She articulates a grievance that is encountered among Liberians across West Africa. &quot;Here we go with the tiring figures again,&quot; she says. &quot;But we musn't forget that $ 500 million, more than was given in 135 years to Liberia, was given to support the Doe administration. If we're talking about U.S. policy, clearly there is a lot of fault to be placed at the doorstep of the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Deputy Assistant of State for Africa Leonard Robinson says that view is too simplistic. &quot;We can't rewrite history,&quot; he says. &quot;The Doe regime was the consequence of 100 years of most Liberians being left out of the system,&quot; due to the dominance of descendents of the Americo-Liberians who founded the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, Robinson says, &quot;Liberians should take the responsibility for solving their own problems. We have got to move away from this paternalism that we wear in the West, that our system is best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mends-Cole dismisses that argument. &quot;The Liberian people marched in Liberia and asked Doe to step down,&quot; she says. &quot;They marched to the U.S.  embassy and asked the U.S. to intervene, placing themselves at severe risk.  Where were Doe's arms coming from?  Most of the huge military arsenal came from the U.S. or was bought with U.S. aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson and Mends-Cole agree, though that the U.S. can play a constructive role by supporting the current peace effort and pressing any reluctant parties to cooperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The success of that effort can't come too soon for Liberian refugees.  Exhausted by the difficulties of exile, many are talking of return. An estimated 70,000 have already gone to Monrovia, swelling the city to several times its normal size and straining its ability to function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most refugees say they won't return until the situation becomes more stable and the countryside safer. For their children's sake, many say, they dare not risk it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosetta Goweh turned out to be one of the lucky ones. Despairing of getting visas for her sons while she remained in Abidjan, she decided on a bold move. She returned to the U.S. and applied from there, taking advantage of an immigration service directive that the immediate families of Liberians already in the United States would be allowed to join them. When the papers arrived in Abidjan, the boys' visas were issued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interviewed by phone from her temporary home in Charlotte after her children arrived, Goweh said she still is praying for peace. Meanwhile, she says, the family is safe, together -- and the boys are doing well in school.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gamma Business Among the munitions and other commodities shipped by the ISC to defendent ARMSCOR through Gamma were:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a.  components for use in air to air, ground to air, and ground to ground missiles including gyros, infrared detectors, cryostats, magnetrons, xenon bulbs, high voltage power supplies and laser rods;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b.  components for night vision devices including micro-channel plates, image intensifier tubes and fiber optics; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c.  components for inertial navigation systems including two axis gyros, rate gyroscopes, linear accelerometers and pendulums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gamma smuggling was accomplished by portraying this ISC front compny known as a domestic customer and misrepresenting the nature of the product and end-user to United States Customs.  In or about September, 1987, subsequent to a seizure of Gamma business records by law enforcement authorities, the ISC defendants dismantled Gamma and established another front company known as Triangle Engineering to disguise ISC shipments of munitions and electronic components to defendent ARMSCOR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Military Systems Sales</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between in or about 1981 through in or about 1989, the defendants would and did engage in the sale of in excess of $ 10,000,000 of military systems to defendant ARMSCOR which were purchased from United States vendors and shipped without the proper licenses to RSA.  These systems included:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a.  technology for the inertial and land navigation systems and gyroscopes for aircraft, missiles, vehicles and helicopters;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b.  film reader tracking systems for military test ranges; and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c.  telemetry antennas designed to support a tracking system for a military test range.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These miltary system sales to defendant ARMSCOR were accomplished by the defendants through a series of false and fraudulent statements on export declarations and other shipping documents in order to disguise the true nature and value of the systems as well as their intended use and end-user, because the defendants knew or had reason to know that RSA and defendant ARMSCOR were subject to an arms embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 40mm Grenade</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1981, ISC would and did develop drawings and a technical data package for production of a 40 millimeter (&quot;mm&quot;) grenade.  This grenade was derived from the United States army's 40mm grenade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between in or about May, 1981 and December, 1981, the defendants would and did transfer this grenade technology and technical data to defendant ARMSCOR without a license or approval by the Department of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1983, in order to facilitate ISC's marketing efforts for the 40 mm grenade, the defendants would and did export to and re-import from RSA a cutaway display model of the grenade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about June, 1987, defendant ARMSCOR engineers encountered problems with the fuse mechanism for the RSA's copy of the United States Army's 40mm grenade.  In order to assist defedant ARMSCOR in solving these problems, the defendants would and did provide United States technical data and technical assistance to ARMSCOR engineers at ISC without a license or approval from the Department of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Striker Problem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Begining in or about 1980, the defendants would and did assist defendants ARMSCOR and KENTRON in the development of anti-armor, antitank missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1984, ISC would and did enter into an agreement with KENTRON to market the RSA missile internationally, and ISC began negotiations with the Peoples Republic of china for hte sale of $ 300,000,000 of missiles andmissile production tecnology.  ISC was to recieve approximately one-third of ARMSCOR's profits from this sale.  This program became known as the &quot;Striker&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At various times in or about 1986, in order to resolve development problems with the Striker, the defendants would and did illegally import from the RSA a Striker model, missile bodies, and launch tubes into the United States, and would and did attempt to import Stiker rocket motors by routing trans-shipment of such munitions through Italy or Belgium and by misrepresenting to the Department of Treasury on Imports Permits that the country of origin and manufacture was either Italy or Belgium, when in truth and fact the country of origin and manufacture was the RSA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1987, in order to conduct testing and resolve the operational problems with the Stiker for the Chinese contract, the defendants would and did illegally transfer technology and technical data concerning wind tunnel tests to RSA engineers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PF-1 Program</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beginning in or about 1982, ISC developed a proximity fuze for international sale. A proximity fuze is a detonation devise desinged to enable an explosive warhead to detonate above the target in order to maximize the kill ratio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1986,.ISC entered into a contract with the Peoples Republic of China for the sale of fuzes and technology to provide fuze production capability. During the testing stage of this contract, ISC began to experience problems with premature detonation of the fuzes. In an effort to avoid contract penalties, in or about February, 1987, ISC contracted with defendant FUCHS to provide ISC with technical assistance to resolve the fuze problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to solve the fuze detonation problems, in or about March, 1987, the defendants would and did misrepresent the fuzes as metal parts, and shipped 5,500 fuze casings to Darion Pty., LTD.(&quot;Darlon&quot;) n the RSA acting for defendant FUCHS. These fuze casings were smuggled to the RSA for intergration of South African electrical systems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 50 fuzes were fitted with the South African electrical systems, the defendants would and did cause the fuzes to be imported back into the United States for testing, again misrepresenting the nature of the product and country of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1987, the defendants would and did arrange for South African engineers from defendant FUCHS to visit ISC to work on the fuze detonation problem. During this visit, the defendants would and did cause the transfer of fuze technical data without proper notification to and approvals by the Department of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In or about 1987, based on technical assistance provided by the South African engineers, ISC corrected the fuze detonation problems, and thereafter would and did re-import the 5,450 fuze casing which had been illegally shipped to Darlon.  n</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Africa News reported in 1976 that a meeting had taken place two years earlier between a senior South African defense offical and two American companies, one of them International Signal and Control (ISC), there was no way to predict what the collaboration was to yield (see story).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We later learned that ISC had been seeking a multi-million dollar contract to study and construct a sophisticated ocean surveillance system for South Africa and was trying to obtain a license for the project from the U.S.  government. ISC's silent partner in the deal was the New Hampshire-based Sanders Associates. A large-scale behind-the-scenes lobbying effort, in which Sanders played a central role, resulted in approval for the license just before the 1976 New Hampshire primary, where President Gerald Ford was facing stiff opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lobbying also produced a letter to Ford from a powerful group of U.S. senators, calling on the administration to lift the arms embargo against South Africa. An internal Sanders document obtained by Africa News said that the South African project &quot;was established following significant dialog (sic) at very high levels in both governments&quot; (see AN, April 13, 1981).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1978, following imposition of the mandatory United Nations embargo against South Africa and a reinforcement of U.S. restrictions by the Carter administration, the ISC/Sanders license was revoked. It was at that time, according to the indictments issued in Philadelphia last month, that the illegal arms shipments began.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A massive decade-long conspiracy to violate the U.S. arms embargo against South Africa has been unmasked by federal prosecutors in Philadelphia.  Indictments were returned by a federal grand jury on October 31 against the South African government-owned Armaments Corporation (Armscor), two affiliated companies, and 10 American and seven South African nationals. The accused are charged with illegal munitions sales valued at more than $ 10 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government imposed a ban on arms sales to South Africa in 1963 and added stronger provisions in 1977 when a mandatory United Nations embargo was adopted. Additional restrictions were enacted by Congress in 1985.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to prosecutors, the chief alleged American conspirators are James H. Guerin and his former associates at International Signal and Control Company (ISC) in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Some of the sophisticated weaponry and parts sold to South Africa by ISC are said to have been re-exported to Iraq. In addition to the arms export offenses, Guerin -- who founded ISC in 1971 -- is accused of inflating the value of his company when it was sold four years ago to a major British defense firm, Ferranti International. Guerin has denied any impropriety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the Johannesburg Weekly Mail on November 8 reported that at least 38 foreign companies broke the United Nations embargo against South Africa. The Mail says companies in the United States, Japan, Britain, Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Austria, France, the Netherlands, Australia, Spain and Brazil took part in major transactions. More than 60 South African companies imported and exported thousands of tons of arms on Armscor's behalf during the 1980's, the newspaper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Philadelphia indictments suggest that ISC made a crucial contribution to Armscor's efforts to breech the international embargo and keep the South African military well supplied. Throughout the past decade, the South African government pursued an aggressive regional military posture -- fighting a major insurgency in neighboring Namibia, intervening in Angola and other near-by states, and repelling armed attacks from guerillas of the then-outlawed African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time, Armscor was also actively promoting sales of military hardware around the world. As a result of the alleged wrongdoing, the U.S.  government has recently imposed two-year sanctions against the arms manufacturer that will remain in force until September of 1993, even if the U.S. arms embargo is lifted. The sanctions prohibit exports to Armscor of all military-related items, bar U.S. government contracts with Armscor, and forbid imports to the U.S. of any Armscor-made products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following account of the federal charges is drawn from reporting by Tim Mekeel and Ernest Schreiber of the Lancaster New Era, which because of the importance of ISC to the Lancaster community, has followed the story closely for several years and has published earlier investigative pieces on the company's South African ties. The material is used with the New Era's permission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In two indictments, containing 75 charges against 17 people, the Justice Department portrays Guerin as the architect of the intertwining fraud and export schemes. Although the federal government has been investigating ISC for three years and Guerin and other ISC principals have been named in previous court proceedings, they were never formally charged before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the 51-page fraud indictment, ISC executives created $ 1 billion worth of fake business to pump up the value of ISC. The phony deals boosted the value of the company's stock when it went public in London in 1982 and helped lure Ferranti into buying ISC in 1987, prosecutors charge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 129-page export indictment, prosecutors say ISC used an intricate web of front companies and money laundering to put U.S. military technology in South African hands. ISC exported missile parts, navigational aids, night vision devices, grenades, antennas and missile-tracking film readers to South Africa, all in violation of U.S. and United Nations embargoes, the indictment says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ISC also illegally sold to South Africa $ 4.4 million worth of parts for proximity fuses Q devices that trigger artillery shells. South Africa in turn sold these parts to Iraq, where the armies of Saddam Hussein used them against U.S. troops during the Gulf war, prosecutors say. Federal agents displayed one of the dud Iraqi artillery rounds containing the ISC part during a press conference in Philadelphia where the indictments were announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to prosecutors, the arms smuggling scheme was conducted in cooperation with Armscor, Kentron, an Armscor missile subsidiary, and Fuchs Electronics, a private South African defense firm which makes bombs for Armscor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was the plan of the conspiracy that the ISC and South African defendants would and did for money aid the defendant Armscor in evading the United Nations embargo by selling and smuggling U.S.-made arms, munitions, weapons technology, as well as other restricted commodities to Armscor,&quot; the indictment states. Armscor used the illegally obtained weaponry &quot;to enhance its inventory&quot; and to &quot;market weapons systems to third world countries,&quot; the document says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges provide precise details about both the export scheme and the alleged fraud. They state that ISC executives changed the description and price of the munitions to hide the transactions, then shipped the goods to South Africa through a New York-based front company, Gamma Systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the contract fraud, the indictments say ISC used nearly 50 front companies circulating more than $ 700 million to create the illusion of substantial arms-related contract business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Guerin established ISC in Lancaster, the firm grew into a large defense electronics conglomerate, eventually employing 1,800 people. Its workforce today is about 800, but that is expected to drop to 500 in the next couple of years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the first detailed allegations surfaced in civil suits filed last year by Ferranti, in which the British firm said ISC had been exporting camera and film-reader equipment to evaluate performance of missile systems, navigational systems, and night-vision equipment and heat-seeking missile parts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the unique features of the Zambian election process was the significant role played by both national and international monitors. On the basis of Zambia's experience, independent election monitoring may come to be seen as a necessary component of transitions from single-party rule to multiparty democracies in Africa. Elections without independent observers, such as those in Gabon and Cote d'Ivoire last year, have been followed by persistent disputes about the legitimacy of the subsequent governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian election, in contrast, produced a clear and accepted result, despite the lack of any formal arrangements between the government and the opposition on electoral procedures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the decision in December 1990 to amend the constitution to legalize opposition parties, the government of Kenneth Kaunda retained all the characteristics of a single-party state. The ruling party monopolized public resources, controlled the media and kept complete command of the military and police forces. Although the electoral bureaucracy was semi-autonomous, it was materially dependent on the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, 10 months later the opposition Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) was able to wrest power from the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP). Among the factors on the MMD's side were the depth of the economic crisis, the opposition's broad political base, the increasing assertiveness of Zambia's judiciary as well as its electoral commission, and the vigilence of the monitoring teams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Kaunda rejected the opposition's demand for international observers, a group of Zambians led by a prominent lawyer, Rodger Chongwe, proposed creating a Zambian Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT). President Kaunda relented, as he often did on critical issues, and invited several eminent individuals and organizations to observe the October 31 elections.  Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was invited, and a joint monitoring effort was launched by the Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, entitled Z-Vote (Zambia Voting Observation Team).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several other observer missions went to Zambia, including delegations from the Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity (OAU). But it was mainly Z-Vote that sought changes in the electoral process to improve chances for a free and fair vote. ZIMT lended a hand as did the Zambia Elections Monitoring Coordinating Committee (ZEMCC), which was formed in September. ZEMCC is a coalition of several civic organizations including the Christian Churches, the Law Association of Zambia, the Press Association of Zambia, the Student Union of the University of Zambia, a women's lobby and a council of non-governmental organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike other African countries where national conferences have led to transitional governments charged with organizing new elections, election monitoring teams assumed this mediating role in Zambia. They were criticized repeatedly, especially by the former ruling party's campaign headquarters. Less than a week before the election, a particularly harsh advertisement appeared in the Times of Zambia, accusing the monitoring teams of being part of &quot;an imperialist plot&quot; aimed at destabilizing the country. President Kaunda, to his credit, disassociated himself from this attack and called on Zambians to support the work of the monitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On election day, Zambian voters throughout the country showered praise on the monitors, seeing them as the chief guarantors of a free and fair election. The frequent irregularities caused by inadequate voter records and administrative errors failed to dampen their enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia appears to have reaped certain benefits from agreeing to such a comprehensive election monitoring effort:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Heated conflicts over electoral procedures were minimized by the presence of neutral bodies, which sought compromises to disputes through communication between government and election officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Visiting foreign missions of election experts provided technical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The presence of over 3,000 Zambian monitors and several teams of international observers during the voting and counting enhanced confidence in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Zambian civic associations were given the chance to play an active role in the process and to lay the basis for their continued involvement during the consolidation phase of the new system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Foreign observers from major donor countries reflected the international community's commitment to help the new government meet the challenges of political and economic restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The media's fair coverage of the election and the just implementation of election procedures have set a high standard for subsequent governments to follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Kaunda finally relented and decided to invite international observers, he commented, &quot;Let them come. We have nothing to hide.&quot; As it turned out, not only was there little that could be concealed on election day, but Zambia was able to display the impressive civic virtue and democratic commitment of its people. Seasoned public servants from other countries went away deeply moved by what they had seen and shared as election monitors. They left with indelible memories of how precious a free election was to people who had been denied that right for many years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In time, Zambians will conduct national elections without needing such an extensive exercise involving international monitors. Nevertheless, civic vigilance is the hallmark of democratic society. So Zambians may continue to insist that independent monitoring be an integral part of the voting process in any election.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five other leaders have been ousted by extra-constitutional means, and most of the rest are under pressure to give up all vestiges of the strong-arm methods once so dominant across the continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda's defeat in the most recent African election has sent the strongest signal yet that no leader can take his position for granted. Kaunda was the only president Zambia has known since independence in 1976. He has enjoyed a worldwide reputation as a voice for justice and peace, particularly in southern Africa. But he was defeated soundly by Frederick Chiluba, a trade union leader once imprisoned by Kaunda's government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When pressure began building last year for an end to Zambia's one-party system, Kaunda initially resisted. His first concession was to call a referendum on multiparty rule. But as events in Zambia and the rest of Africa gained momentum, Kaunda cancelled the scheduled referendum and agreed to hold the country's first contested presidential vote in two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite numerous problems that arose during the period leading up to the election, in the end, voting went relatively smoothly. When the results became clear, Kaunda congratulated the winner and quickly stepped aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever mistakes Kaunda has made, by accepting the election results and handing over power so gracefully, he has left Zambia and Africa a very important legacy,&quot; says Makau wa Mutua, a Kenyan lawyer who is project director of the human rights program at the Harvard University Law School. &quot;History will remember Kaunda for this.&quot; Mutua credits the election observers, both from within the country and from outside, with helping to ensure a creditable outcome.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another round of peace talks are scheduled to begin this week in Rome between the government of Mozambique and the Renamo guerrilla movement. Progress in previous sessions, sponsored jointly by Mozambique's Catholic Church and the Italian government, has been slowed by procedural wrangling. However the eighth round, which ended on November 13, resulted in a protocol dealing with legal registration procedures and the obligations of political parties. The Mozambique government which has made numerous concessions in the talks, has appealed to the world community to pressure Renamo to cooperate, amid growing fears that the group has no real agenda other than banditry. The government of South Africa, which supported Renamo in the past, says it no longer provides any aid. Several reports in recent years have linked Renamo to a network of right-wing extremist groups in Europe and the United States, as well as in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ruth Minter has seen more of Mozambique's history up close than almost any other American. During the war against Portuguese colonial rule, she taught at a secondary school run by Frelimo, the Mozambique independence movement, which is now the governing party. For the last year, sponsored by the United Church Board for World Ministries and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), she has taught at a seminary outside Maputo, the Mozambique capital.  In this letter, she shares her personal perspective on what the continuing war means for some individual Mozambicans.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace does not feel any closer here in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday when I arrived at the seminary, I found that about two-thirds of the faculty and students had gone to visit Mr. Panguana, a grandfather, probably in his sixties, who works at the school. Every Wednesday he does all the measuring of dry items -- peanuts, flour, salt, sugar, beans -- at the campus &quot;store,&quot; which is really a consumer cooperative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on Tuesday night he was kidnapped by Renamo from his home. The night was in the 50-degree range, and he was taken without having adequate clothing. He soon began to cough. (His captors) told him to stop coughing or they'd kill him. He couldn't. They punched him in the chest with rifle butts.  He got worse and became short of breath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally the commander took pity on him -- told him to go home, which he did. We are grateful that he is alive, even though his chest is very bad and it will take time for him to recover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A week earlier we had begun second semester. Telvina, the wife of one of our fourth-year students, returned with her children from visiting family in Gaza Province. She was also very much in shock and relieved to be back safely.  The night before she left to return here, her family's house was in the middle of an attack in which Renamo burned 60 houses all around theirs. People died but she did not stay to learn details. She says it was an area people thought was safe, so they had everything at home and lost all -- food, clothes, furniture, dishes... In &quot;insecure&quot; areas, people often bury or hide many of their things and sleep outside their homes in trenches or under bushes, knowing attacks usually come at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last peace talks finally began to talk about item one of an agenda with a couple of dozen items. The government here has been very eager to find a way to end the war and has proceeded with many changes that &quot;the world&quot; would think Renamo must have wanted: a multiparty system with elections, a &quot;free and open&quot; economy, a chance for Renamo's people to participate as full citizens despite all the years of atrocities. But Renamo never had a political program or structure. It was created to help military intelligence in white-ruled Rhodesia before it became independent Zimbabwe. It was handed off to South African military intelligence in 1980. They found it in their interest to destabilize Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Renamo only had its first political congress -- presumably to work out its identity and goals -- after the peace talks began. Their conservative friends around the world must have told them that they should learn to negotiate and talk politics. But they balk at every step and I cannot imagine that they feel ready to compete as a political party of free, responsible citizens. That is not what they were trained for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the ground, I still have never heard anyone who has experienced an attack who could give a story of Renamo trying to win hearts and minds or organize politically. They tell only of terror, death, mutilation, atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Sofala province has had the worst drought in 40 years, causing major shortage of food. Every attack in the war means more dislocated people needing support until resettlement and self-support is again possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long, o Lord, before your Mozambican people will have peace?</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Togolese Prime Minister Joseph Kokou Koffigoh has proven his staying power once again, fending off the army's third attempt to topple him during Togo's fitful transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the latest attempted coup began late last month, Koffigoh and President Gnassingbe Eyadema -- who has been stripped of almost all but his ceremonial powers -- have been negotiating to form an interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are seeking to establish a ruling body that would satisfy both democracy advocates and the army's Eyadema loyalists, and therefore have a chance to last until elections scheduled for June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least 17 people, mostly soldiers, died when pro-Eyadema troops backed by tanks stormed the prime minister's office and briefly arrested him December 3. Twenty-six civilians died the previous week in clashes between troops and pro-Koffigoh demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">France sent some 300 troops to neighboring Benin in response to appeals by Koffigoh, but only 10 soldiers entered Togo, to guard the French Embassy. French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said France had no plans to send an expeditionary force to Togo because &quot;it has no business telling people what should be done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koffigoh, a human rights lawyer, was named prime minister in August by a national conference which left Eyadema virtually powerless following widespread protests and strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the latest unrest, borders and the international airport have reopened, but the country remains &quot;unstable,&quot; says one U.S. official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of people fled to neighboring Benin and Ghana after the border crossings reopened. Some of the estimated 15,000 refugees arriving in Benin said they feared for their lives because they had criticized Eyadema, an autocratic soldier who staged independent sub-Saharan Africa's first coup in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koffigoh ordered a return to work late last week, but unions are urging an indefinite general strike beginning December 11. A recent call for a general work stoppage was largely unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyadema ordered troops back to their barracks last week. Although they have stayed there, they have been gritting their teeth as Koffigoh remains in office, analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are saying, 'If it doesn't go the way we like it, expect us to rise again,'&quot; says the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats say there is evidence of a purge of pro-Koffigoh soldiers within the army, which is dominated by Eyadema's Kabye ethnic group, and fears are growing among Togolese that the danger of ethnic rivalry will increase. The Eyadema government heavily favored the army's Kabyes, who are from Eyadema's region in the north, while southern Ewes felt increasingly isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the president has called for the punishment of mutinous soldiers, opposition leaders charge that he has instigated the unrest and is sabotaging the transition to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There appears to be good reason for fears that the soldiers will act again. Last week's attack was their fourth attempt to keep Eyadema in control.  But there also are signs that their efforts might be backfiring. Koffigoh's sheer resilience is winning him widespread respect in Togo; cheering crowds greet him wherever he appears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eyadema loyalists are calling for the dissolution of the High Council of the Republic -- the transitional legislature which sparked the recent crisis by banning Eyadema's former ruling party. The president's backers also have demanded that Koffigoh form a broad-based government that includes Eyadema supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koffigoh has said he refuses to buckle to demands of any particular group. &quot;I know the people are with me and it is the people whom I serve, not any special interests,&quot; he told reporters last week after the coup attempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Koffigoh and Eyadema are barred by the transition plan from contesting June's polls.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gabon, which last year became one of the first single-party states in Africa to adopt a multiparty structure, is seeking a return to the oil-fed good times of the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For some time they were the Kuwait of Africa, but it didn't work,&quot; says one World Bank economist, because the bottom fell out of the oil market and people lost money. Now, Gabon wants to break its dependence on oil, expand its exports and attract investment as it strives to become Africa's version of Hong Kong.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects for achieving these goals are relatively good, according to a recent analysis produced by the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). Already, the economy has received a boost by the addition of a new oil field, Rabi-Kounga, which increased the country's petroleum output by 25% last year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ambitious diversification and expansion plan will work, the Economist report forecasts, only if &quot;the recently introduced experiment with political pluralism proves a success&quot; and President Omar Bongo &quot;refrains from excessive interference in the affairs of government,&quot; leaving the prime minister free to direct the year-old administration. At the same time, the EIU says that a comfortable win for Bongo in the multiparty presidential election scheduled for 1993 would help secure the present stability</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bongo's agreement last year to legalize opposition parties and newspapers came amid political strife and strikes in which hundreds of Gabonese took to the streets demanding wage hikes and an end to one-party rule. The protests followed government payroll cuts prompted by depressed oil prices and excessive government spending .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EIU's scenario stipulates that a return of domestic unrest could scuttle any prospects for economic recovery and growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like many developing countries, Gabon has relied on its chief resource -- in this case oil -- for income, and the country has suffered as world prices waxed and waned. Now Gabon wants to export more timber, manganese, uranium and other natural resources to help revitalize its economy, which suffered a downturn during last year's political turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For investors, one of Gabon's advantages is its membership in the &quot;franc zone,&quot; which guarantees a stable exchange rate and continuity of fiscal and monetary policy, says the EIU study, authored by Patricia de Mowbray, a British economic consultant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. direct investment in Gabon last year more than tripled -- from $ 139 million in 1989 to $463 million -- largely due to the $300-million purchase of the government's stake in Rabi-Kounga oilfield by Amarada Hess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabon, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is sub-Saharan Africa's third largest oil producer, after Nigeria and Angola. Eighty percent of its exports were petroleum-related last year and petroleum activity generated 42% of the gross domestic product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all oil revenues, Gabon has serious fiscal problems. In 1980, the country's annual per capita income reached $ 4,000, but falling oil prices pulled it below $ 2,800 in 1987, according to the World Bank. Growth in the non-oil sector is not expected this year and only modest advancement is anticipated next year, says Prosper Youm, an economist with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, one State Department official notes, &quot;There are a lot of other countries that would love to have Gabon's problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a population of only 1.2 million, Gabon's civil servants are among the highest paid in Africa, earning the equivalent of those in Senegal which has 7.2 million people, Youm says. World Bank figures show Gabon's per capita gross national product last year as the highest in sub-Saharan Africa at $ 2,960 -- almost three times that of neighboring Cameroon which follows Gabon in African oil production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gabon's wealthy elite flaunt ostentatious villas and flashy imported cars, but the vast majority of Gabonese are poor and the gap between the classes is growing wider, analysts say. Civil servants, students and teachers, who are caught in the middle between the two extremes, led last year's protests, accusing Bongo of causing unemployment and wage cuts by corruption, nepotism and economic mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bongo, who assumed power in 1967, eventually yielded to pressure to grant pay raises. &quot;It was essentially a give-away by the president&quot; to quell the unrest, says the World Bank official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May, the National Assembly approved a new constitution providing for a multiparty system and legislative elections. In October, the IMF approved a stand-by credit for Gabon, authorizing drawings up to the equivalent of about $ 38 million to support its new economic reform program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gabon's dependency on oil revenues, inadequate diversification of its economy, and a heavy debt burden have given rise to large financial imbalances,&quot; the IMF said in a statement. &quot;The emergence of a broadly based non-oil sector is fundamental to restoring steady and sustainable economic growth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EIU study says oil itself might help Gabon make the transition to a broader-based economy. Following the opening of the Rabi-Kounga oilfield, additional production increases &quot;are now in prospect and higher revenues should open the way to diversification of the economy away from oil,&quot; says the report, &quot;Gabon to 1995: Will Oil Secure Economic Transformation?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Gulf War, investors became more wary of the risks attached to the presence of large military arsenals in key oil-producing areas, the report adds. &quot;In West Africa the arsenals are far too small to provoke international conflict.&quot; As a result, potential investors may find countries like Gabon more attractive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has much better chances than some of its neighbors, but it has a long way to go,&quot; says the World Bank economist. However, if Gabon can solve its economic problems as efficiently as it seems to have quieted political discontent, analysts say it could become one of the international business community's new favorite sons in Africa, replacing unstable regimes that have resisted calls for democracy and reform.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">AROUND THE CONTINENT: KENYA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1171 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi has yielded to demands from the country's pro-democracy movement that he allow opposition political parties to operate in the East African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move came one week after international donors, meeting in Paris, decided to suspend aid to Moi's scandal-ridden government. But the president's opponents caution against viewing the action as a sign that he is ready to loosen his 13-year grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi has frequently called advocates of pluralist politics names like &quot;rats&quot; and &quot;anarchists.&quot; A month ago he predicted that competing parties would not operate in Kenya until the year 2000. Last month, under mounting internal and external pressure, he revised the timetable for multipartyism to &quot;two to three years,&quot; and two weeks ago he promised to legalize the opposition &quot;soon.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can we take him seriously?&quot; asks Makau wa Mutua, a Kenyan who is projects director of Harvard Law School's human rights program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy advocates in Kenya say the president needs to take further steps to prove his commitment to political reform. They are demanding a national conference, the release of political prisoners and amnesty for exiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutua is skeptical that Moi will agree. He says the president &quot;knows that a national conference would bury him alive&quot; as it has other African strongmen. Since a pro-democracy wave began sweeping the continent two years ago, national conferences called by democracy campaigners have stripped power from several long-time African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donor pressure seems to have forced the pace of reform in Kenya, following disclosures of corruption and abuses by high-level government officials and violent crackdowns on pro-democracy demonstrators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya has long been regarded in the West as one of Africa's most stable nations, and over the years it has been attractive to foreign investors. U.S. direct investment to Kenya last year was $ 115 million. But the latest statistics from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rank Kenya fourth on the continent -- behind Liberia, Nigeria and South Africa -- in the loss of assets to capital flight. High levels of capital flight usually indicate either large-scale corruption or lack of confidence in a country's economy, or both.  The report says that Kenya had over $ 2.6 billion in overseas accounts as of theend of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's economy is heavily dependent on foreign aid. It received about $ 900 million in aid this year and hoped to win even more for 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States had been prepared to pledge $ 47 million in economic assistance to Kenya for next year, an increase of $ 8 million over 1991, said one U.S. official. Instead, Washington has agreed to release only a previously agreed-upon $ 19 million for family planning, agricultural research and assistance to private humanitarian agencies, all programs that have little connection with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi first showed signs of bending to the pressures for political reforms last month when he fired one of his closest political allies -- former cabinet minister Nicholas Biwott, who had long been accused of corruption by reformists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biwott also has been named by witnesses as a prime suspect in the murder last year of foreign minister Robert Ouko, a vocal opponent of official corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Biwott increasingly seen publically as an obstacle to cleaning up graft in Kenya, Moi apparently began to sense that he had become too great a liability to the government. The president ordered Biwott's arrest while Kenya's 12 major aid donors were meeting in Paris to decide the fate of the country's economic aid package.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complaints that Kenya is guilty of human rights abuses have also assumed new prominence, as the democracy movement has become more widespread.  Last month, riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse hundreds of opposition supporters who tried to attend a rally, and shot dead one demonstrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some opposition leaders fear Moi is offering only the appearance of reform in an effort to get back into the good graces of international donors, and that he has no real intention of expanding Kenya's political life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let them (opposition parties) go and get the mandate from the people -- they will get zero,&quot; Moi said last week at a special conference in Nairobi of the ruling Kenya African National Union (Kanu). &quot;I will not run away into exile. I will remain here. I want Kanu to remain here for another 100 years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party delegates, responding to Moi's December 2 announcement that Kenya will allow political pluralism, voted to scrap the 1982 constitutional amendment, Section 2A, that had made Kanu the nation's sole legal political party. The amendment enshrined what was already a reality; other Kenyan parties had been banned since 1969.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament is expected to follow Kanu's lead and enact legislation legalizing opposition by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The next battle between the president and his critics is likely to be over the timing of elections. Under current law, the government must call elections at least every five years. The last ballot in 1988 was widely viewed as rigged and prompted the surfacing of the opposition movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvard's Mutua says that donors &quot;should not be fooled&quot; if Moi announces elections for next year -- a political move Mutua says would be a &quot;recipe for disaster&quot; for the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they rush headlong into elections without a national conference, Moi will manipulate the electoral process and win the election,&quot; says Mutua. He says the opposition needs to demand a conference to &quot;unmask (Moi's) deception,&quot; as well as to win a mandate from the Kenyan people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi's opponents also must overcome ethnic, personality and age differences, which until recently have been submerged in the common drive for political change. A split emerged in the opposition's umbrella group, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (Ford), shortly after Moi announced his proposals for reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gap continued to widen this week. On Sunday, three of Ford's six founding members said they would try to register their faction as a party under the Ford name. Martin Shikuku, speaking for the three, said they were upset that former president Oginga Odinga had welcomed &quot;outsiders as Ford members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the Odinga group are several former political detainees, former cabinet members and dissident lawyers, including Kenya Law Society head Paul Muite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moi has long warned that a pluralist system would lead to conflict among Kenya's dozens of ethnic groups and result in domination by one group or in anarchy. He says the wrangling in Ford's ranks is proof of his fears. &quot;I told you that with multiparty, tribalism will come,&quot; he told the Daily Nation newspaper on the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents disagree, pointing out that both sides in the Ford dispute represent a diversity of ethnic groups. &quot;The disenchantment against the government is universal,&quot; Mutua says. &quot;The distaste crosses ethnic boundaries.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONFLICT: LIBERIA</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2170 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gbarnga, Liberia -- Charles Taylor, the 42-year old rebel leader who launched the uprising that engulfed Liberia in a devastating civil war, is mounting an aggressive campaign to become his country's president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of fighting and a year of uneasy truce, hopes for a return to normalcy have been raised by a new peace plan. An accord sponsored by regional leaders mandates an internationally supervised election by the middle of next year, after disarmament of all armies and militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although implementation of the new agreement is moving slowly, the American-educated Taylor has no wasted no time in launching his presidential drive, using techniques that have proven effective for political candidates in the U.S. While his potential opponents bicker over who should run against him, Taylor is blanketing the country with campaign messages on radio and television. He is also traversing the countryside, trying to convince war-weary Liberians that the man who started the conflict is the right person to lead them to peace.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We think the majority of people understand our position and support us,&quot; Taylor said in an interview at his headquarters. &quot;We expect to win.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Taylor led a small group of armed insurgents across the border from Cote d'Ivoire into Liberia on Christmas Eve two years ago, he expected to quickly cover the 200 miles to the capital Monrovia and seize power from President Samuel K. Doe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That plan was thwarted by unexpectedly fierce resistance from Doe's U.S.-equipped army and by splits within rebel ranks. The bitter battles left thousands dead and caused half the country's 2.6 million people to flee their homes, many into exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As atrocities by all sides mounted, West African governments stepped in to stop the carnage. With few resources and no prior experience in mediation, the West African Economic Community managed to end the civil war and oversee negotiations, something no regional grouping anywhere in the world has accomplished before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Europeans haven't been able to do it in Yugoslavia,&quot; said Ambassador Joseph Iroha, a former Nigerian envoy to Brussels who has served as the Ecowas representative in Liberia throughout the peace process. Ecowas stepped in last year at the height of the fratricidal killing because &quot;we couldn't allow this sort of thing to continue,&quot; Iroha says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the intervention has left Taylor bitter. &quot;After the American revolution, your general of the army George Washington was given the opportunity to lead the country,&quot; Taylor says. &quot;We took up arms, got rid of Doe, and took more than 95 percent of the country,&quot; he said. &quot;But we were denied what was our right -- not by other Liberians but by the so-called West African peacekeepers,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interview was conducted -- with armed commandoes posted outside the door and inside the room -- in a large hilltop mansion which serves as the headquarters for the provisional government Taylor has established in Gbarnga (pronounced BONG'-GAH), a pre-war provincial capital, 125 miles from Monrovia.  Used as a guest house by former Liberian presidents, the building is ringed by command posts and anti-aircraft artillery. Inside the mansion, Taylor is heavily guarded and all visitors are subjected to thorough searches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the past year, the country has been divided into two distinct camps. Monrovia, where some 8,000 West African troops maintain control, is administered by an interim government protected by the West African peacekeeping force, known as Ecomog. The rest of the country lies behind lines controlled by Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first steps in the peace process are to expand operations by the multinational force into Taylor territory, to open roads to unfettered travel, and to disarm and encamp the NPFL forces, along with those of other warring parties. Ecomog is slated to take control of checkpoints, borders posts, seaports and airports throughout the country during a 60-day period that began on November 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One thing the accord doesn't cover is control of the mass media.  Except for the upsurge of small newspapers in Monrovia, Taylor appears to hold all the cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Monrovia area on FM 88.9 and throughout the rest of the country on the medium-wave band, Taylor's modulated voice is heard hour after hour, intermixed with the latest pop music from the United States. Residents of Gbarnga and the Atlantic Ocean port of Buchanan, can see Taylor's television as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, an interim government-run radio station broadcasts a few hours daily on a small shortwave transmitter provided by Ecomog. But most Liberians don't have access to shortwave or to the half-dozen Monrovia newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So at the moment, for information and entertainment, most Liberians have only Taylor's stations, featuring his recorded prayer for peace, repeated excerpts of his speech attacking &quot;selfish, power-hungry&quot; politicians in Monrovia, and his occasional &quot;exclusive&quot; interviews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am using the radio to promote peace,&quot; Taylor says. &quot;That is better than preaching hate, lies, and deception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amos Sawyer, a university professor who is serving as president of the interim government in Monrovia, concedes that the peace accord doesn't cover all factors that will influence the election process. &quot;It is not an ideal plan,&quot; he says. &quot;We do expect some obstacles along the way. But it should be possible to have free and fair elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer's administration, made up of representatives of most of the country's political parties, armed factions, and civic, professional and religious organizations, was installed in Monrovia last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We had expected to expand the authority of the interim government across the length and breadth of the country,&quot; Sawyer said. But Taylor resisted, charging that the mediation effort was a Nigerian-led plot to bar him from power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer, who was teaching political science at the University of Indiana when he was tapped for the job, says he still is committed to the provision in the original peace plan that bars the interim president from running for office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sawyer rejects Taylor's assertion that the NPFL is the legitimate authority in the country. About a third of Liberia's people are in Monrovia and about an equal number in exile, he says, with the rest in areas that fall behind checkpoints controlled by Taylor's bands of armed youth. &quot;There are no doubts in the minds of the people as to where the civil authority rests,&quot; Sawyer says, predicting that those in areas under Taylor's control are &quot;geared up with their bundles ready to come this way once the roads open.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the assertion is difficult to confirm, long lines of people with their possessions in tow gather daily in Kakata, site of the NPFL checkpoint closest to Monrovia, seeking passes from the commander of Taylor's forces to permit them to travel to the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest agreement on opening the roads and holding elections, worked out at a late October West African summit chaired by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire, appears to have a better chance at success than previous plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecowas's Iroha says he is confident that momentum towards disarmament, encampment, and elections is well-established and will not be sidetracked by the numerous technicalities still under discussion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To mitigate Taylor's unease over Nigerian and Ghanaian dominance of Ecomog, 1500 troops from French-speaking Senegal are being added to the peacekeeping force. Some 700 Senegalese soldiers -- many of them veterans of Senegal's participation in the Gulf War -- have been airlifted to Monrovia in a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport and outfitted with surplus American gear. The rest are due to arrive this month, along with a small contingent from Guinea-Bissau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Taylor continues to raise objections. &quot;We have a government here,&quot; he says. &quot;This government is not going to be dissolved, and this army will not be dissolved.&quot; While agreeing that the NPFL's disarmament and encampment will be &quot;supervised&quot; by Ecomog, Taylor says &quot;Liberian sovereignty&quot; must be respected. Taylor, whose personal guards reportedly include crack soldiers from next-door Burkina Faso and dissidents from the Gambia and other nearby nations, says he will not give up armed protection by his own men during the election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also threatens to retaliate against the armed group based in neighboring Sierra Leone, which has attacked NPFL positions near the Sierra Leone border. The group, known as Ulimo (United Liberation Movement of Liberia), is made up mostly of former Doe soldiers. Ulimo was formed to repulse last March's invasion of Sierra Leone by NPFL troops commanded by a Sierra Leone dissident -- an apparent attempt to overthrow President Joseph Momoh.  Ulimo has announced its acceptance of the peace terms, and Taylor says his forces now control the entire border area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday, Sierra Leone claimed that two of its soldiers and a driver were killed over the weekend in fighting with Taylor's soldiers, despite Taylor's pledge to withdraw from Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major General Ishaya Bakut of Nigeria, the Ecomog commander, admits that implementation of the peace plan is taking longer than he had hoped. But he says his troops are getting cooperation from all the parties. &quot;No one wants to be seen to be standing in the way of elections,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travel from the outskirts of the Ecomog-controlled zone to Kakata, a 25-mile stretch, is made slow and cumbersome by the presence of some 20 NPFL roadblocks, each with a congregation of young men, many appearing to be under 15 years old, with some type of automatic rifle slung across their shoulders.  Beyond Kakata, the armed youth are still in evidence, but the roadblocks almost disappear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Arthur Kulah, leader of Liberia's United Methodist Church, who has made six trips into the interior from Monrovia, says he has seen a great reduction in tensions during the five weeks since the peace accord was signed in Cote d'Ivoire. &quot;The roads have not officially opened and the checkpoints have not been dismantled, but the attitude has changed quite a lot,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the problems and the continuing reservations Taylor says he has about Ecomog, the rebel leader expresses a firm commitment to the election process outlined in the peace plan.  Replying to a question, he says his support includes a willingness &quot;to accept the results of the process if we are defeated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he doesn't plan to lose. And he attaches great weight to the fact that former President Jimmy Carter's International Negotiation Network has been asked by the West African states to observe the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor implicitly acknowledges that many Liberians hold him responsible for the widespread killing and looting carried out by his forces.  &quot;War is never good; people die in war and properties are destroyed,&quot; he said.  &quot;But we think between now and the election we will have explained some of these irregularities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While access to most of the country remains blocked for the Monrovia-based politicians who may oppose him, Taylor is travelling widely to get his message across. Last month, he visited Maryland County in the southeast and the eastern region of Grand Geddah, Doe's home area, where hostility to Taylor is said to be the greatest because his troops massacred large numbers of Doe's Krahn ethnic group. Taylor said the reception he has received on these tours suggests that &quot;ethnic tensions have eased&quot; and that war wounds are healing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor's critics accuse him of drawing out the peace process in order to enrich himself and his top aides by selling off the country's natural resources. A former government procurement officer in Doe's government, Taylor was accused of embezzling nearly a million dollars in the early 1980s. Since the incursion, exports of timber, rubber, iron ore and diamonds have gone from Taylor-held areas to the outside world through Cote d'Ivoire as well as via the Liberian port of Buchanan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taylor says the money has gone to support his war effort and is now being used for hospitals and schools. He denied profiting personally from the revenues and says he has no secret bank accounts oversees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to concerns that his troops are now a law unto themselves, with unrealistic expectations of big payoffs, Taylor says he commands the loyalty of all his commanders and troops. Some diplomats say they fear that elements of Taylor's forces may resist disarming, since their weapons give them authority and access to privileges. Neither soldiers nor officials in Taylor's civilian administration receive regular pay. Instead, they are given extra rations of rice and other items to sell or trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect some dissatisfaction,&quot; Taylor said, likening the potential discontent to the feelings many U.S. Vietnam veterans had on their return from war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But mutiny -- no!&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Charles Gilks, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, believes that AIDS may have been introduced to humans during research on preventing malaria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article in the November 28 issue of the British journal Nature, Gilks writes that during experiments begun in the 1920s, researchers in Europe and the United States injected chimpanzee and monkey blood into human subjects in the hope of inducing resistance to the malaria parasites that were in the blood.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these recipients of primate blood must be considered at risk of developing retroviral infections,&quot; Gilks said, if the blood contained simian immunodeficiency virus, which is considered by many researchers to be a likely source of what became, in humans, the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gilks, who is currently a visiting scientist at the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi, told the BBC that he hopes his theory may lift some of the burden of blame off Africa. He said Africa has been unfairly credited with &quot;starting&quot; the AIDS epidemic, and that Africans have been accused in popular literature of perverted sex practices with monkeys.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My theory is testable,&quot; Gilkes says in the Nature article. He urges researchers to trace previous experiments, including those involving prisoners in the United States, to see if blood samples can still be found. If so, and if they test positive for retroviruses, he says, his idea about the appearance of HIV in humans is plausible. Gilkes says he hopes that testing such hypotheses will encourage the debate about the origins of AIDS to &quot;become more scientific.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1122 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan -- Although AIDS was only diagnosed in Cote d'Ivoire's major city in 1985, the disease has rapidly overtaken other causes of death among adults, prompting fears of a looming public health crisis. And because Abidjan is a crossroads of West Africa, the spread of the disease here is an indication of what may be happening in countries throughout the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-year-old Project RETRO-CI, a collaboration between the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and the Ivorian health ministry is trying to determine the magnitude of the problem. Project director Kevin De Cock says he doesn't think the enormity of the challenge Africa faces is fully appreciated. While he cautions against &quot;doomsday predictions,&quot; which he says are not useful, De Cock says there is an urgent need for &quot;accurate, sober assessment of what is a real catastrophe.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a study De Cock authored for the journal Science last year, the rate of death from AIDS is higher here than in New York City, where the malady has been prevalent for a longer time. Rates of infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, are higher still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even those figures probably mask the true incidence of the disease, De Cock says. The medical team stuck to a tight case definition of AIDS in calculating the causes of death. But the third leading cause of death among those studied was tuberculosis -- a disease commonly linked to AIDS -- and of those, 50% were HIV positive. &quot;So there are people dying of HIV-related disease who don't fit the AIDS definition,&quot; De Cock says. In addition, those studied accounted for less than half the deaths in Abidjan during the 105 days of the survey, while the city's entire two-million population was used as a denominator for calculating rates of death and infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Cock and his colleagues made their determinations from blood samples of bodies in Abidjan's two largest morgues. Results showed that 41% of males and 32% of females were HIV infected. The study also found that AIDS is the cause of death in 15% of men and 13% of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other recent studies in Abidjan have shown a 12% HIV infection rate among pregnant women in some parts of town and 15% among new blood donors. In comparison, the Zaire capital of Kinshasa has rates of about six to eight percent for pregnant women and 10-12% among blood donors. British journalist Mark Huband has reported that at least 60% of patients receiving treatment at the Center for Infectious Diseases at Abidjan's University Hospital are HIV positive, according to the center's director, Dr. Justine Agness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For women, the AIDS epidemic comes on top of a high maternal mortality rate of 15%, which is the leading cause of death among adult women. &quot;What's striking,&quot; says Kevin De Cock, &quot;is that if you add the two together, it means that over a quarter -- between a quarter and a third -- of female death is due to sexually transmitted disease or maternal mortality, just emphasizing the importance of reproductive health.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The RETRO-CI researchers worry that Abidjan has become a more efficient transmission point than most African cities that are plagued with AIDS. One Ivorian study found rates of infection in the countryside only slightly below that of Abidjan, in contrast to Zaire where many rural areas apparently remain relatively free of the disease. Scientists theorize that the well-developed roads and transportation systems in Cote d'Ivoire have facilitated the spread of AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another concern is the travel routes that radiate from Abidjan throughout West Africa. The country's booming economy over much of the past two decades attracted so many foreign workers that, today, as much as a quarter of the population is from other countries. A survey of some 1,500 hospital admissions in Abidjan found patients representing 22 nationalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high percentage of the foreigners are young men away from their families, and patronizing prostitutes is common among that group. With some Ivorian doctors estimating at least a 50% HIV infection rate among the city's prostitutes, transmission of the virus may be escalating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Against that background, the rapid rise in the sale of condoms is encouraging, says Steve Chapman of Population Services International, a group founded two decades ago to promote family planning. He says that in the first five months of this year, nearly twice as many condoms were sold in Cote d'Ivoire as in all of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapman credits the Ivorian government with dismantling legal and economic barriers to condom distribution, by repealing a law that limited condom sales to pharmacies and removing tariffs that increased condom prices to consumers. Now condoms are available in numerous shops and roadside stands at a fraction of their former cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, health workers say, limiting the spread of AIDS is still a formidable task. People who work with prostitutes say the women complain that if they ask their customers to use condoms, the men take their business elsewhere. Since most prostitutes are working for survival money, the threat of infection is less immediate than money for the next meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapman concedes that AIDS incidence rates are not falling and that there has been no dramatic change in sexual behavior. But he argues that the foundations for change are being laid. &quot;Now is the time to roll up our sleeves,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin De Cock says agencies like RETRO-CI have an important role to play in that process. &quot;Research projects will have to focus more on intervention,&quot; he says. &quot;There is a need to evaluate attempts to reduce infections, (whether they be) educational campaigns or medical interventions or, in the future, vaccine interventions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, De Cock cautions that prevention should not be the only concern. It is also important, he says, to address problems in the care and treatment of those who are already ill. The lack of resources for medical treatment is worsened when a patient's employment is threatened. In Abidjan, there have been instances of domestic servants or food handlers losing their jobs after testing HIV positive, as has happened in other cities around the world -- a reaction De Cock says is uninformed. &quot;You couldn't go out to eat in Abidjan without someone who is HIV positive somewhere along the line dealing with your food,&quot; he says. &quot;And the same is true of New York and San Francisco.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Cock says the difficulties caused by HIV infection and AIDS are the same all over the world. &quot;They occur in different cultural contexts,&quot; he says, &quot;but the actual issues are exactly the same. And it seems that each society has to go through the painful learning process of dealing with this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Africa, truck drivers discuss it, young people perform plays in the streets about it and presidents lecture on it. The subject is condoms and AIDS experts say the West can learn a lesson from Africa's candid approach to dealing with the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AIDS has become so entrenched on the continent that virtually no community can afford to be prudish about discussing sex -- the main mode of transmission of the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS -- and condoms, which have proved effective in curbing the spread of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems that we are now breaking through the stigmatic phase&quot; of AIDS in Africa, says Dr. Eric van Praag of the World Health Organization (WHO). &quot;Communities are opening up and accepting AIDS as part and parcel of their societies.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have no choice. About one in every 40 adults in sub-Saharan Africa is infected with HIV, and of the approximately 200 people who contract the virus every hour, more than half are African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO estimates that some seven million people in sub-Saharan Africa have been infected since the pandemic began in the early 1980s. A total of 121,000 cases of AIDS, among 418,000 worldwide, have been reported across Africa, but experts say the actual figure is much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at the world as a whole, the toll in human suffering, health care costs and social disruption already seems unbearable, but there is far worse to come, especially in the developing world,&quot; says Dr. Michael Merson, director of the WHO Global Program on AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO predicts that by the year 2000 the cumulative number of adults and children infected with HIV will triple or quadruple, rising from the current 9-11 million to 30-40 million. At that time, developing countries will hold close to 90% of the world total of AIDS cases and Asia and Latin America are expected to outpace Africa's infection rate. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), which destroys the body's immune system, takes as long as 10 years to develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Africa has been the hardest hit by AIDS, with 21,719 cases reported in Uganda, followed by Tanzania with 21,208 cases and Zaire with 14,762. But the pandemic is not confined to the east; in the West African city of Abidjan, AIDS is the number one cause of death in men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind these grim statistics, however, is a creative effort among Africans to fight AIDS as it selectively strikes young and middle-aged adults who are the mainstay of young children and elderly relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the bar in the Good Luck Guest House in Chalinze, Tanzania, customers, many of them truck drivers, often receive free condoms with their drinks. In Cameroon, a group of female prostitutes have toured cities performing &quot;Marriage to the Condom,&quot; a play about AIDS and the importance of using the prophylactics to avoid contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But sex workers and their prospective customers are not the only ones talking about AIDS and Prudence -- the name of a brand of condoms widely used in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are a lot of heads of state who are talking about condoms and talking about AIDS as part of society,&quot; says Dr. Van Praag, who recently returned from Zambia where he headed an AIDS education team for three years.  Former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda was one of the first leaders to speak candidly about AIDS -- one of his sons died of the disease in 1986. Other presidents, including Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, have taken to the airwaves to caution against unsafe sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan First Lady Janet Museveni has been a strong advocate of community-based programs to promote public health and the welfare of children, including efforts to stem the spread of HIV infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We use radio, we use TV, we use drummer groups, we use religious leaders in their places of worship, we use teachers in teaching institutions,&quot; says Museveni, who last month attended the 1991 AIDS Prevention Conference in Washington. &quot;So many times, the only way that you can get information to the people is by word of mouth, so we have to travel around the country to talk from place to place to give this information to our people,&quot; she says, noting that illiteracy is widespread across the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Uganda and Tanzania, governments have adopted a multi-sectorial approach to fighting AIDS, expanding their anti-AIDS programs beyond the health ministries and into the education, social welfare and other government sectors, says Dr. Van Praag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Malawi -- where officials strictly enforce laws requiring women to wear long skirts and men to wear short hair -- the government subsidizes the sale of eight million condoms annually. In addition, a government AIDS Band sings cautionary songs about the disease. By age 10, children in government schools are taught about the sexual transmission of AIDS, and at 12, they learn about condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This contrasts with the United States where the distribution of condoms in New York City high schools made national news, and where television networks only recently decided to accept advertising for the prophylactics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think that we can learn a lot from the African response to AIDS,&quot; says Dr. Van Praag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most successful education and condom-promotion programs in Africa has been in Zaire, where the word Prudence is synonymous with safe sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Condom sales in Kinshasa alone quadrupled from one million to four million between 1988 and 1989, according to Steve Chapman, projects officer for Population Services International, a private group which provides technical assistance for health and family planning programs in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was very impressed to see how widely (the Zaire programs) had managed to spread information about AIDS in so short a time,&quot; says WHO's Dr.  Merson. He says condom sales across the country rose from less than one million to over 15 million within three years. &quot;This gives us hope that it is indeed possible to make people aware of the risk of infection and to change sexual behavior in a very short time,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Census Bureau has reported that if condom use were increased by 25% in urban areas in Africa, then HIV prevalence actually would drop in the next 25 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But success stories in Africa should not divert attention from the magnitude of the AIDS problem, experts say. The disease will continue to kill scores across the continent, leave thousands of children orphaned and further strap an already burdened healthcare system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHO says that health care costs &quot;are set to skyrocket&quot; across the continent. Already, up to 80% of the adults hospitalized on medical wards in some African cities have HIV-related diseases. Data from studies in the Americas and in Africa show that up to half of the total national expenditure for health would be spent on AIDS care if the needs of AIDS patients were fully met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The hospitals are under tremendous pressure to cope with this AIDS load,&quot; says Dr. Van Praag. If patients do not find care, they may &quot;give up and die at home&quot; without adequate medication and attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More work needs to be done, officials say, and the safe sex message needs to be even stronger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We don't have a Magic Johnson in Africa,&quot; says Dr. Van Praag, referring to the U.S. basketball star Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson who recently disclosed that he was infected with HIV through heterosexual intercourse and has been asked to participate in the work of the National Commission on AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapman says a role model who would be &quot;living proof&quot; of the AIDS message is needed to promote condom use to Africans. &quot;We need someone ... to look them in the eye and say, 'Use it. We're not kidding. It needs to be done.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even successful beginnings do not guarantee results. Zaire is having problems keeping its safe-sex campaign going as its political crisis -- sparked by government resistance to pro-democracy campaigns -- continues to worsen.  Project SIDA (AIDS in French) recently suspended a plan to start a major trial on an AIDS vaccine in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Merson says that today there are about 12 experimental vaccines being tested in the United States and in Europe on small groups of people. He says WHO is setting up sites in Uganda, Rwanda, Brazil and Thailand to test vaccines that look safe and immunogenic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't think we can count on having a vaccine for worldwide use either for prevention or for treatment of HIV infection to prevent AIDS before the end of this decade,&quot; says Dr. Merson. &quot;Each day, 5,000 new persons are infected with HIV, and so right now, we have to focus our efforts on education while we hope that a vaccine will come in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For many of Africa's children, even tomorrow is too late.  Some 10-15 million uninfected children, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, will lose their mothers to AIDS by the turn of the century, according to WHO.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have of late been having more and more orphans because of AIDS, and our work has become more and more difficult, because we have to support children all-around -- the way they're going to live, the way they can be educated, the way they will be fed,&quot; says Janet Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally, children without families to care for them were being housed in orphanages, but their numbers became too overwhelming due to the war in Uganda as well as to AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We encourage relatives now to take care of their children, but that means that most of the relatives are grandparents, and they are not able to support the children, because they can't work anymore,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As time goes on, the children themselves become high risk for HIV infection, says Dr. Van Praag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Children who lose their support at an early age, he says, are victims to poor education and they &quot;easily become street kids&quot; whose only chance for survival is prostitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar, Senegal -- After a decade of declining involvement in Africa, American firms are showing new interest in the continent, drawn by widespread moves towards democracy and economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sign of that trend was the arrival here of a delegation of American business leaders who toured West Africa last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a definite change of attitude on the part of American business,&quot; said Percy Wilson, an executive of Coca-Cola Africa, a subsidiary of the Atlanta-based beverage company. Wilson, whose headquarters in London, joined representatives of other American companies at the end of their four-nation tour for a meeting with top business leaders from two dozen African countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the demise of apartheid in South Africa and the end of authoritarian rule in many other countries, companies that once left Africa or never were attracted there are now paying attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The political changes taking place in many African countries are making them a lot more attractive to American companies,&quot; said Kevin Callwood, vice president of the U.S. government-run Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), which along with the U.S. Agency for International Development sponsored the visit, with stops in Gambia, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana as well as Senegal. The corporation, which promotes foreign investment by U.S.  firms and insures investors against politically caused loss, has organized similar tours to other parts of the world. But Callwood said this trip, with over 40 companies taking part, is &quot;the largest investment mission OPIC has ever put together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies represented on the trip are involved in mining, marketing, construction, agribusiness, and finance. Several are minority-owned companies eager to expand in Africa. Two of the largest participants are telecommunications firms, Comsat and Bell Atlantic, looking for opportunities created by the privatization of many African telephone companies and by the growing demand for voice, data and cellular services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were impressed by the improving climate for private investment everywhere we went,&quot; said Eugene Elrod, a Washington attorney who represents the Houston-based Tarpon Resources, which is planning to invest in gold mining ventures in Ghana and several other countries. &quot;There are lots of opportunities, and competition is not nearly so intense as in more developed areas of the world,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although political change has swept Africa at a remarkable pace this year, news of the changes has been overshadowed by events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. But Daniel Montana, a California investment banker with extensive experience in the former Communist bloc, said Africa offers more immediate prospects for profitable investments. &quot;Everything is in place -- a legal system, basic transportation and communication,&quot; said Montana, chief executive of VTN Corporation of Los Angeles. This infrastructure will not be ready in most of Eastern Europe or the Soviet Union for five to 10 years, he estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1980s was a period of severe economic downturn in Africa caused by deteriorating trade terms, falling commodity prices, and failed economic policies. As a result, U.S. investment in all African countries dropped to $ 4.7billion last year, after a peak of $ 6.8 billion in 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Companies lost interest in Africa,&quot; said Robert Tubman, general manager for Africa at Federal Express, a participant in the OPIC/AID investment mission. &quot;Lack of accountability on the part of the politicians and arbitrary actions to stifle business by governments meant it just wasn't profitable to operate here,&quot; he said. But democratization is bringing the companies back.  Responding to the demands of its American corporate clientele, Federal Express expanded its operations to 25 countries earlier this year and is adding 23 more by January 1, Tubman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The political changes have been accompanied by sweeping economic reforms, instituted by over 30 governments in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The new measures, in which the private sector is given a greatly expanded role, are designed to promote the recovery of African economies and restore the confidence of outside investors and donor governments and agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are spreading the word that the Africa you once knew is not Africa now,&quot; said Evelyn K. Mungai, a Kenyan business woman and member of the African Business Roundtable, a continent-wide group of 60 top business leaders which convened here last week to meet with the OPIC mission. With the elimination of much &quot;cumbersome bureaucracy&quot; and of corruption in many countries, Mungai said, &quot;we are finding a lot of Americans are interested in coming back -- or coming here for the first time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increased American attention is heartily welcomed by Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank and a leading African economic spokesman, who founded the business roundtable in 1987, based on the belief that the private sector is the best way to sustain development in Africa. Along with official aid, foreign investment is &quot;absolutely crucial for consolidating democracy,&quot; Ndiaye said in an interview. &quot;As in Eastern Europe, if these experiments are not to fail, it is necessary to inject sufficient resources into places where change is taking place,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During a visit to the U.S. last month, Ndiaye made the case for investing in Africa in meetings with top American business leaders and in addresses at the New York Stock Exchange and the Council on Foreign Relations.  &quot;Wide-ranging business opportunities exist all across the continent,&quot; Ndiaye told a well-attended luncheon at the stock exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the atmosphere for doing business in Africa has improved greatly, problems remain. Elrod, a partner in the Washington law firm Sidney and Austin, said high start-up costs remain a deterrent to investors, particularly when lingering bureaucratic obstacles create delays and uncertainties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As an example of such difficulties, Federal Express cites its efforts to get landing rights for its planes, which have been blocked by protectionist rules designed to aid African-owned airlines. As a result, Africa is the only continent where the company does not make deliveries in its own aircraft and where -- as a result -- service is somewhat slower than in other parts of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the problems, Africa is &quot;catching on&quot; with many American investors, said Alison Rosenberg, deputy assistant secretary of State for Africa. &quot;Even though it is very far away and relatively unknown, the news is spreading that you can do business in Africa,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Addis Ababa -- It was neither free elections nor a free market that finally toppled the 17-year old dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Mariam in Ethiopia last May.  Instead, it was the superiority of popular guerrilla movements over what was Africa's largest, but most fragile army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just days after Mengistu's flight to exile in Harare, Zimbabwe, the Ethiopian Peoples Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLF) marched into their respective capitals at Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and Asmara in the territory of Eritrea, which has been fighting for independence from the Ethiopian government.  Thus began two differing experiments in what, given current trends, falls under the rubric of &quot;democratizations.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At talks brokered by the U.S. government in London last May, the EPRDF committed itself to a national conference to form a transitional government. In July, some 25 political and professional organizations gathered in Addis Ababa and endorsed the country's new National Charter.  The document, a sort of road map for the two-year transitional period, establishes a Cabinet and Council of Representatives, endorsed the UN Declaration of Human Rights and set forth a commitment to national and regional elections within a specific timeframe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Charter also decrees what might be considered the ultimate expression of democracy, specifically, that all &quot;nations and nationalities&quot; in Ethiopia should be granted the right to self-determination, up to and including independence.  The resolution has had the greatest immediate impact upon the Red Sea territory of Eritrea.  With the 30-year war now officially ended, Eritrea is governed by a provisional government of the EPLF which operates independent of the Transitional Government in Ethiopia.  According to the Charter, an internationally-supervised referendum -- offering Eritrea's four million people a vote on independence -- will be held within two years; in the interim, Assab -- on the Eritrean coast -- is a free port for Ethiopia, which has no other access to the sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Charter's resolution on self-determination also means -- in theory -- the end of domination of one nationality by another, a significant departure from Ethiopia's history.  In practice, the resolution is already having significant impact: the internal borders of the country are being re-drawn; for the first time people are speaking their mother tongues in public; and many people are exhibiting pride in identities that have been suppressed for decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bringing Ethiopia's national contradictions out of the closet also poses some serious threats to the country, however, as old animosities die slowly and some -- predominantly the urban Amhara elite -- appear disinclined to give up the reigns of power.  At the same time, Ethiopia's ever-growing number of national movements represent varying degrees of political development; in much of the north, for example, alternative social and political structures were in place by the time the center collapsed last spring.  Many movements in the south, however, have not yet completed the process of &quot;liberation&quot; and are thus vying, militarily, for territory.  Most significantly, given the strength of national sentiment, the unity of Ethiopia (excluding Eritrea) will depend upon the ability of the Transitional Government to reflect the aspirations of all Ethiopia's peoples and thus forge a new national identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few years ago, the profound changes sweeping Ethiopia and Eritrea would have been referred to as &quot;the cessations of hostilities,&quot; or perhaps, &quot;the end of the war.&quot; Now they're referred to as &quot;the emergence of democracy&quot; and the &quot;beginnings of good governance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the cases of Ethiopia and Eritrea, such terminology begs several questions, among them what &quot;democracy&quot; means to societies that have been systematically controlled ever since &quot;Ethiopia&quot; came into being.  To donor governments, many of whom now maintain special funds for democracy and good governance, democracy means free elections, multiparty political systems, respect for human rights, a free press and economic liberalization. To varying degrees, each of these is in the cards for Ethiopia and for Eritrea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But democracy here is a much broader concept, as it has meant confronting head-on the problems that have been traditionally suppressed by force.  The outcome involves a radical transformation that goes far beyond recognition of individual political rights to include the redefinition of the country itself and the purposes of nationhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, &quot;economic democracy&quot; is also on the agenda, particularly in the eyes of the new government in Addis Ababa.  Brought to power largely through the support of Ethiopia's poor peasant majority, the Transitional Government gives equity high priority.  Traditional economic reform programs, however, often run counter to economic egalitarianism and foster the emergence of distinct economic classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the World Bank and other major donors to Ethiopia are offering what is, in relative terms, a flexible package of assistance involving a $ 500 million &quot;Economic Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Program,&quot; there is an emphasis on free markets and privatization.  For its part, the Transitional Government favors a decentralization of power and the development of distribution and marketing systems that offer incentives to the peasant majority.  At the same time, however, there is concern -- in a country characterized by a long-term dependency on international relief -- that structural adjustment may have adverse effects upon the poor, while favoring a class which has, in the past, enjoyed top status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although democratization is widely perceived in almost all quarters as a positive move for Ethiopia, it is not a panacea and it also, in some cases, is posing problems of its own.  Balancing the diverse political views in the Council means that national policy-making requires weeks -- and sometimes months -- of deliberation, despite the fact that the economy is in need of swift and decisive action and other decisions are equally urgent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Transitional Government has cut military spending by well over 60%, it has seen few budgetary gains and must contend with the needs of over 25,000 de-mobilized soldiers. It has yet to receive the $ 150 million pledged by donors to rehabilitate the former troops.  Security conditions in the south of the country remain poor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As elsewhere in Africa, everyone is using the same language, but not everyone is talking about the same thing.  Democracy in Ethiopia has meant the emergence of well over 40 political movements.  By contrast, the Eritreans are emphasizing the upcoming independence referendum as a primary manifestation of democracy, and are not likely to encourage the emergence of a multiparty system until after the national vote in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Addis Ababa government argues that political success in Ethiopia requires the immediate granting of full political rights and freedoms throughout the country.  The Provisional Government in Eritrea, on the other hand, operates from a belief that in a country without any experience of freedom, democracy must be guided in order to prevent its abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenge to the international community is to recognize that both governments may be pursuing paths to greater popular participation.  For if democratization is to bring real change to Africa's poorest region, it must be democratically defined -- that is, as the saying goes, be by and for the people.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">936 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York -- President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire is a figure in criminal conspiracies to launder millions of illicit U.S. dollars, according to a tape recording the FBI made secretly during an undercover sting operation in New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations come at a time when the U.S. government is under increasing pressure to cut ties with Mobutu and support the forces pressing for democratic change in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FBI investigation that led to Mobutu began in July 1986, when Federal agents received information that a United Nations ambassador, Lloydstone Jacobs of Antigua, along with several associates, was involved in a wide variety of criminal activities, ranging from money-laundering to bank fraud, advance fee schemes, and the sale of counterfeit or stolen checks, stocks and bonds, according to sworn testimony by Special Agent Jack F.  Camanella in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations that President Mobutu was involved in money laundering activities were found in an examination of thousands of pages of testimony, legal papers and government exhibits filed in the Federal money-laundering case against New York State Senator Andrew Jenkins. In the Jenkins case, the government charged the then-senator with conspiring to launder money through Zaire.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the first known instance of an allegation of this type against Mobutu. The president is assumed to have accumulated his huge fortune by siphoning revenues from the sales of his country's extensive natural resources, by demanding kickbacks from people doing business in Zaire, and by diverting foreign aid funds to his own accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on information supplied by an informant as well as victims of the ambassador's alleged criminal activities, the FBI initiated an undercover investigation of the diplomat and his associates. They dubbed the case Operation Short Sell, in a humorous reference to the Wall Street trading practice known as selling short -- which means, in essence, to sell securities that the seller doesn't own, based on the expectation that the stock price will drop, yielding a profit on the difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of the FBI's investigation, Special Agent David Manicus assumed the guise of &quot;Dan Garth,&quot; a criminal who needed millions of dollars of tainted money cleaned up. Agent Manicus made contact with the ambassador's associates, and once he gained their confidence, gently pressed to meet as many people involved in the group's criminal activities as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the people Manicus was introduced to, according to court records, was a criminal named Louie Moore -- a fast talker who claimed to be a Hollywood producer with numerous celebrity contacts. Snared by the FBI sting, Moore pled guilty to two charges of conspiring to sell stolen travelers checks and counterfeit treasury checks. In May 1987, facing a potentially long jail term, Moore also agreed to become an informer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He introduced Manicus to more than a dozen of his criminal colleagues, including Senator Andrew Jenkins, the testimony says. Moore identified the senator as a man who could launder big money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenkins was a man who apparently had everything going for him. Tall, handsome, with an athletic build, he was a respected elected official. As a liberal Democrat, he had championed minority rights as well as the interests of the constituents in his St. Albans district in the Queens section of New York City.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On June 5, 1987, Moore introduced the FBI's undercover agent to Senator Jenkins. In the first meeting, the agent, posing again as Dan Garth, told the senator that he had money he needed laundered. Jenkins mentioned several ways the money could be cleaned up. One of the ways, Jenkins said, would be through his bank, the Afro-American Development Bank in Kinshasa, Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a later discussion with Moore about the illegal nature of the funds Jenkins agreed to launder, the senator was taped as saying: &quot;As long as it looks like business, I don't have any obligation to see where the money is coming from.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also explained to Manicus, the undercover agent, that he smuggles money in and out of Zaire by diplomatic pouch, according to transcripts of the conversations filed in the senator's court case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agent Manicus agreed to pay Jenkins $ 150,000 in cash to get the operation going. Speaking into the agent's hidden microphone, the senator was recorded as saying that part of the money would go towards bribing high-level Zairean officials: &quot;The secretary of state gets $ 59,000. My partner gets $ 40,000. The secretary of state is the brother-in-law of the president of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenkins indicated that for the money-laundering to proceed, both the secretary of state and the president of Zaire would need to be paid off. Firms with legitimate interests in Zaire have confirmed that the president routinely requires a cut of any major business or fiscal operation. Similar charges against Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega resulted in a U.S. indictment, after he was deposed by U.S. forces in Panama.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenkins lost his senate seat in 1990 when he was convicted on two of the government's charges against him -- accepting a deposit without being registered as a U.S. bank and the use of a telephone in furtherance of a crime. His conviction was upheld on appeal, and the former senator, who maintains his innocence, has said through his attorney that he will appeal to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire officials have not commented on the testimony that Mobutu and his top aides were cooperating with international criminal activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, DC -- When President Mobutu Sese Seko's term in office formally expired on December 4th, Zaire watchers were braced for trouble. With opposition to his 26-year rule escalating, the U.S. government prepared a contingency response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After unpaid army troops mutinied in late September and joined civilians in a looting spree, fears of bloody civil strife in Zaire grew. At least 250 people are estimated to have died in the September rioting, with shortages of food and medicine threatening its 35 million people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November, CIA analysts warned the administration that the likelihood of renewed violence increases as remaining stocks of essential goods are exhausted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correctly anticipating that the Zaire leader would cling to power after his presidential term expired, the State Department had prepared press guidance for possible issuance in Washington and Kinshasa, the Zaire capital, noting that &quot;many Zaireans are questioning the constitutional legality&quot; of Mobutu extending his tenure. &quot;While we are aware of the various arguments, it is the Zaireans themselves who must render judgment on the matter,&quot; the guidance states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A tougher statement, declaring U.S. non-recognition of the term extension, was drafted but never cleared for release, according to two administration sources who asked not to be identified. The sources say private messages have been sent, urging Mobutu to allow an opposition-led government to assume control over all aspects of the country's administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 5th, with military forces on alert, Mobutu made his announcement that he would remain in office, pending an election in which he plans to be a candidate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that Zaire has remained relatively calm, despite fears to the contrary, has given the U.S. more time to decide how to respond. &quot;If there had been a lot of killing,&quot; one official said, &quot;we would have had to react.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Belgian and French governments, who after evacuating their citizens from the country have withdrawn and refused further dealings with Mobutu, have pressed for a firmer U.S. stance, diplomats say. In an interview published on October 28 in the Paris daily Liberation, Mobutu responded to a question about pressure from the U.S., Belgium and France, following a meeting of the three governments in Brussels, by claiming &quot;it was France and Belgium that were expressing that desire.&quot; The U.S. representative &quot;tapped his fingers on the table&quot; and &quot;was not in agreement with the other two,&quot; Mobutu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's perception of an enduring American lifeline is contributing to his refusal to relinquish power, in the view of critics of administration policy. &quot;Why does our government continue to support a man who pathologically clings to power for the benefit of his entourage and himself and to the detriment of his long-suffering people,&quot; says Dr. William Close, an American physician who served for 16 years as Mobutu's personal doctor. &quot;The longer Mobutu remains, the more brutality and repression and human misery will spread,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zaire leader has a long record of support for American policies, including providing a base for covert interventions in Angola and other African countries and strongly supporting the Gulf War. He has visited the White House on numerous occasions and has known President George Bush since 1972.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with the end of the Cold War and the sweep of democracy across Africa, the administration is facing new demands to cut the old ties. &quot;It is precisely because the U.S. has funded and tolerated this regime in the past that we now have an obligation, in my view, to stanch the chaos and internecine bloodshed,&quot; David Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who chairs the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a letter last month to Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser at the White House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Republican Senators -- Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Alan K. Simpson (R-WY) -- sent a similar appeal to Scowcroft, asking for a &quot;more active and more visible U.S. role,&quot; and Kassebaum has pressed senior officials make a break with Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat and chairman of the Senate Africa subcommittee, convened hearings, held consultations with top administration officials, and sent a letter to President George Bush decrying &quot;the apparent lack of a strong diplomatic effort to promote democracy&quot; in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House of Representatives in a November resolution urged administration action and called on Mobutu &quot;to step down and permit the transitional government to return the country to democratic rule.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the army mutiny in September, William Close has been peppering officials in Washington with phone calls and letters, urging swift action to avoid greater suffering and civil war. He has had a letter to the editor published in the Washington Post and an op-ed piece in the New York Times, both making the case that the administration needs to cut ties with Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Warlick, who spent 16 of the last 26 years in Zaire as a Presbyterian missionary, is devoting most of her time and energy to lobbying for a change in U.S. policy. After being evacuated with her husband, son, and about 3,000 other Americans in September, she testified before Senator Simon's subcommittee, organized a petition from other missionaries and a letter from her denomination, and called Congressional and administration offices pressing for action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warlick and Close reject administration assertions that Mobutu's potential successors might not be up to the task of running the strategically placed nation, which is rich in natural resources. &quot;In the first place, I don't think that is true,&quot; Warlick said. &quot;But what business is it of ours -- it's up to the Zaire people to choose their leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Close says the opposition coalition known as Union Sacre (Sacred Union) has behaved responsibly during the current crisis. The day after Mobutu announced his intention to remain in office, Union Sacre called a stay-home strike, rather than sending people into the streets where clashes with Mobutu's well-armed troops could have resulted in a massacre. &quot;I am afraid that the upper levels of our government are not going to react until some terrible crisis erupts,&quot; Close says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nancy Warlick says she was commissioned by the people she left behind in Zaire to plead their case. &quot;So many friends said to me as we left, Tyou go back and tell the people in Washington to let us proceed with the democratic process,'&quot; she says. &quot;So that's why I'm here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days before the expiration of Mobutu's term, Warlick heard from White House staffers that what she understood was to be a tough statement on Mobutu would be issued. &quot;They said it would be the one I had been asking for -- cutting ties with Mobutu publicly and immediately,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the White State failed to make any pronouncement at all, Warlick renewed her lobbying campaign. &quot;Let's make the statement that we have disassociated ourselves from Mobutu,&quot; she wrote in a December 17 appeal to Secretary of State James Baker III. &quot;God help the people of Zaire if we do not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of Africa's most corrupt and durable dictators maneuvered to stay in power during 1991, as he saw his control slipping. President Mobutu Sese Seko's third seven-year presidential term ended December 4, but he refused to step down, despite widespread unrest and the opposition's move to form a rival government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, who came to power with CIA backing in 1965, has said he will remain in office until elections can be scheduled, but has given no date for the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democracy protests led to a national conference in August, but it collapsed amid opposition claims that Mobutu had rigged the proceedings to ensure his survival. In September, disgruntled army units revolted and looted cities, leaving 250 people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following month, Mobutu reluctantly installed Etienne Tshisekedi, the opposition coalition's choice -- but sacked him 48 hours later in a clash over who would wield the real power, including control over finance and the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu then named Nguza Karl-I-Bond as prime minister, over opposition objections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nguza, a former Mobutu aide who once was on death row for treason -- before being pardoned by the president -- has been trying to win sufficient domestic and international backing to form a credible government. Meanwhile, the national conference resumed deliberations and on December 12 chose as its president Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, who won 65% of the votes in defeating Mobutu's candidate.</SPAN></P>

Polisario launched its fight against Spain in 1972, but found itself battling Morocco's attempt to annex the territory when Spain pulled out the following year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace plan projected internationally-supervised elections in January, but disagreements over procedures have stalled the process. Morocco remains in control of the territory and strictly limits access to it. Although a limited number of UN personnel arrived in the territory before the year's end, none of the parties to the agreement would speculate on when the next steps towards elections might be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A British newspaper, the Independent, reported in November that Morocco has moved tens of thousands of people into the territory, in violation of the peace agreement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early December, troops loyal to the president made their third effort in three months to unseat Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the attack, during which Koffigoh was briefly abducted, the prime minister has been trying to broker a deal between Eyadema and opposition trade unions and political groups that will enable a transitional government to rule until elections planned for next June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koffigoh was selected in August by a national conference that removed most of Eyadema's authority. The conference resulted from months of pro-democracy protests led by a coalition of human rights and political groups demanding an end to the president's 24-year authoritarian rule.</SPAN></P>

Nyerere, who stepped down voluntarily in 1985 from the presidency and last year from the chairmanship of the ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi party, said in a November interview with Radio Tanzania that additional parties should be allowed, although not as many as 30 as has happened in other African countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, who succeeded Nyerere and won relection last year in an uncontested poll, has allowed discussion on multiparty democracy and appointed a presidential commission to solicit public opinion on pluralism.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition accused Diouf of winning the 1988 elections through fraud.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, the president has promised a reformed voter registration plan, proportional representation in the legislature and free access to the media.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The slightly right-of-center National Republican Convention won 16 governships to the 13 won by the moderately left-leaning Social Democratic Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vote in the 1991 contests was much larger than in the December 1989 local elections, when many Nigerians stayed home. One part of the preparation process was a national census in November, the first for Africa's most populous nation since 1973.The vote comes after two months of controversial primaries which saw both parties engage in widespread electoral fraud. Nigeria has known only two brief periods of civilian rule since independence from Britain 30 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Ibrahim Babangida, who came to power in 1985, has said he wants to be Nigeria's last military ruler. The country is trying to implement a two-party system -- both parties were created by the government -- and presidential elections are to be held in late 1992. Babangida lifted the five-year ban on political activity in May 1989. After the gubernatorial elections, the government removed the prohibition against participation in elections by former politicians.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DEMOCRACY, VARIOUSLY DEFINED, IS THE WORD OF THE DECADE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">542 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;An election doesn't automatically create a democracy,&quot; said one African activist when asked about the status of reforms in his country. &quot;There are elected leaders without accountability. And true democracy is not just political. It is also economic.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any attempt to classify countries as democratic or undemocratic, free or not free is tricky, although the exercise can be useful. The African Governance Program at the Carter Center of Emory University divides countries into democratic and authoritarian camps. It further designates some countries as &quot;regimes in transition&quot; with a strong, weak or ambiguous commitment to democracy and others as practicing &quot;directed democracy&quot; or exhibiting &quot;contested sovereignty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent issue of the program's newsletter, editor Richard Joseph replied to a letter from political scientist Catherine Scott, who criticized the categories as simplistic for &quot;equating elections with democracy in a formalistic way&quot; and for ignoring the common exclusion of &quot;women, the poor and other disenfranchised groups&quot; from political life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We recognize the need to reflect deeper, and often contradictory, dynamics,&quot; said Joseph, promising to present a more complex methodology as it is developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following brief look at Africa's 54 nations does not attempt to classify countries according to their systems of governance. Nor does it probe the definitions of democracy. It is, rather, a news round-up, meant to convey the variety and the pervasiveness of on-going political changes throughout the continent and its off-shore islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as an arrangement of ink on paper, this summary cannot convey the drama of the African democracy movement. Behind every national conference, every new prime minister appointed, every election, there are real people who have flooded the streets in demonstrations too numerous to mention -- or stayed at home, leaving the streets empty, in observance of pro-democracy strikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the leaders that have been deposed or had their power curtailed called themselves Marxist. Others embraced free enterprise. In the ways that were important to their citizens, however, most were indistinguishable. They shared a tendency towards authoritarian rule that enriched a small elite at the expense of the majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their response to pressures for change, however, their paths have diverged. P. Anyang' Nyong'o, who heads the Nairobi-based African Association of Political Science, observes that among the most reluctant to democratize have been former British colonies, while &quot;Afro-Marxist&quot; regimes, including former Portuguese and French colonies, have shown more readiness to respond to popular demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of African countries is as uncertain as that of the former Soviet republics or the fledgling democracies of eastern Europe. Radical transformations sow the seeds of possible disaster as well as of progress. And Africa begins its climb towards political inclusiveness from the bottom rung of the economic ladder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the nations profiled here share a vast potential wealth and an infectious energy that is seeping across borders, however well guarded. No leader, anywhere on the continent, can expect to be exempt from the results.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington D.C. -- Africa's rapid moves towards democratization could be undermined by a continuing shortage of financial resources, according to leading experts on the continent's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who are denouncing dictators and crying out for democratic rule, often at considerable risk, expect to see a change in their own living conditions in a reasonable period,&quot; says Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank and a prominent economic spokesman. &quot;As in Eastern Europe,&quot; Ndiaye says, &quot;if these experiments in democracy are not to fail, it is necessary to inject sufficient resources into places where change is taking place.&quot; The bank president visited Washington and New York in November to raise awareness of Africa's needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nicephore Soglo of Benin, one of the first of the new generation of African leaders, agrees. &quot;It is essential to support the democratization process if it is to become really rooted in our countries,&quot; he said during a conference on democracy, sponsored by the African-American Institute (AAI) in New York last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, with about a tenth of the world's population, receives about 30 percent of the development assistance dispensed by the wealthy industrial nations and the high-income oil-producing countries. But it remains the poorest continent by far, and its leaders are pressing their case for outside help to help surmount long-standing impediments to recovery and growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have two months arrears in salaries,&quot; says Congolese Prime Minister Andre Milongo, who visited Washington in early December seeking assistance for the transitional administration he has headed since July.  Milongo says economic constraints threaten the country's progress towards full democracy. &quot;We lack the resources to conduct our elections,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa faces the most difficult economic challenge in the world right now,&quot; says Edward V. K. Jaycox, vice president for Africa at the World Bank.  &quot;That is why Africa is at the top of our agenda.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank estimates that sub-Saharan Africa needs $ 19 billion in aid, loans and investment annually for the rest of this decade in order to reverse the decline in living standards that took place across the continent over the past decade. Average growth rates of five percent are the minimum needed to initiate significant increases in per capita income, according to Bank estimates. In addition, the bank says that $ 9 billion in debt relief will be required to offset the impact of the continent's crippling indebtedness. Even taking into account years of repayments and a number of recent debt forgiveness packages by creditors, high interest rates and loan reschedulings mean that Africa still owes more to donors than the amounts it has borrowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a decade of declining living standards, the first glimmers of a turnaround appeared this year with the news that per capita incomes rose by about one percent in 1990, according to the African Development Bank. But the World Bank's annual report on the world debt situation, issued in December, says the progress many African countries have been making economically could be threatened &quot;unless extraordinary action is taken to reduce the debt burden.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main challenge facing Africa is to make democratic institutions more sound and durable,&quot; says Ugandan Vice President Paul Ssemogerere, who also spoke at the AAI democracy conference. Although the &quot;primary responsibility&quot; for ensuring the success of the changes rests with Africans themselves, he said, &quot;support for these democracies in their efforts to improve the well-being of their people is critical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Africa can expect or truly benefit from outside aid, says the African Development Bank's Ndiaye, African governments must launch the first difficult steps -- and many already have done so. Paralleling the political transformations, most countries are engaged in painful economic reforms designed to reverse their economic downturn. These &quot;structural adjustment programs,&quot; as they are known -- usually adopted under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank with the objective of reducing mismanagement and waste and restoring international confidence -- generally entail massive budget cuts that reduce the provision of social services to the populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reforms are harsh, Ndiaye concedes. &quot;With structural adjustment, it is difficult for everyone right now, especially for those in the lowest incomes brackets,&quot; he says. &quot;But these are necessary steps to take, and most people now recognize it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank says the 20 &quot;core countries&quot; engaged in economic reform programs over the past several years experienced growth rates of four percent on average between 1988 and 1990, up from one percent from 1980 - 84 and twice that of &quot;non-reforming countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Critics argue that structural adjustment programs, as currently designed, are worsening -- not bettering -- Africa's economic position. &quot;There has yet to be one instance where these measures have improved the quality of life for local populations,&quot; the Development Group for Alternative Policies, a Washington, D.C.-based non-profit organization, argues in a recent analysis of structural adjustment in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A position paper issued by a coalition of African non-government organizations earlier this year concludes: &quot;The emphasis on export-led growth strategies, rationalization of public expenditures, and liberalization of prices and markets as prescribed by these programs have brought Africa closer to the brink of non-viability and chaos. As aid flows and other forms of external resource transfers dry up or come with heightened conditionality, Africa is sure to face an even greater crisis of resources in the upcoming decade.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndiaye concedes that despite the &quot;first positive signs&quot; of recovery in 1990 and the recent good harvests in many parts of the continent, the economic picture will probably not show an improvement this year. &quot;There has been such a preoccupation with political change that economic activities have slowed in many places,&quot; he says. But he argues that after these changes are in place, &quot;the prospects for vigorous growth will be there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During contacts with American and European business leaders, Ndiaye has been soliciting private investment for Africa. He believes that better government economic policies will attract foreign capital and encourage local citizens &quot;to bring their savings from the countryside into the banking system and to return the money that is now hiding in foreign bank accounts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it has been argued that democracies will have a harder time introducing the tough measures needed to eliminate waste and overspending, most experts see accountable government as a necessary precursor to economic growth. &quot;It is evident from the history of the past thirty years that authoritarianism has stifled development,&quot; said P. Anyang' Nyong'o, secretary general of the African Association of Political Science, in a study of the democratization process in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The existence of popular-based institutions is essential for sustaining democracy and for sustaining development,&quot; says Adebayo Adedeji, former executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa and the architect of the African alternative to structural adjustment, which advocates a more &quot;humanized&quot; approach to economic reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After years of working closely with African governments -- including notoriously corrupt regimes and ruthless dictatorships -- the World Bank is being nudged by public demands within Africa, as well as growing international pressure, to give the issue of governance more weight in its decision making.  Last month's meeting of donors to Kenya, chaired by the World Bank -- which ended with a decision to withhold new commitments of assistance pending implementation of political reforms and a crackdown on corruption -- was an example of how political pressures for change are now intertwined with economic assistance decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bank also has adopted a newly fortified position on debt relief.  &quot;The debt relief policies in place are not adequate,&quot; says Ishrat Husain, chief economist of the African region at the Bank. The most far-ranging proposals adopted by the major donor nations are the &quot;Trinidad Terms,&quot; proposed by British Prime Minister John Major in late 1990, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer, calling for a write-off of about two-thirds of developing nations' debts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's indebtedness rose above $ 270 billion in 1990, including $174 billion for sub-Saharan Africa. The combined debt of the region's countries exceeds the annual Gross National Product by $ 18 billion. In contrast, Latin American external debt is equivalent to about 40% of its GNP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If fully implemented, the &quot;Trinidad terms&quot; would provide sub-Saharan African countries with a maximum of $ 4 billion in reduced debt burden annually for the next several years. However, the U.S. has resisted some aspects of the relief proposal, which in any case falls short of Africa's urgent requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without $ 9 billion in debt relief, the World Bank says, Africa's recovery could suffer serious setbacks. The delay in resolving the debt crisis is diverting the energies of African policymakers &quot;from the urgent task of reviving economic growth&quot; and is discouraging domestic and foreign investors, Husain said in a press briefing this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's entire debt needs to be forgiven, for the sake of children, James P. Grant, executive director of the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) said in releasing the Unicef annual State of the World's Children report for 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is spending more money on the small portion of interest its manages to pay, which is about one-third of what is due, than on health and education, he said.  n</SPAN></P>

Namibia's independence in March 1990 marked the explosion of a continent-wide democracy movement that is spreading -- in the words of former Nigerian head of state Olesegun Obasanjo -- &quot;with a virulence that will be unstoppable.&quot; Almost every country has experienced some form of citizens' pressure for broader public participation in political and economic decision-making. Nearly two dozen authoritarian leaders have been overthrown or forced to share power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is experiencing a revolution as profound as the wave of independence that began to sweep the continent three decades ago.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scholars have begun to write about the protest movement as a quest for a &quot;second independence,&quot; where African aspirations can be pursued with renewed vigor. Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja of Zaire, a Howard University political scientist, says that the people have been ahead of the pundits. &quot;The concept of Tsecond independence' was developed, not by social scientists,&quot; he says, &quot;but by ordinary people.&quot; For them, he says, &quot;independence was meaningless without a better standard of living, greater civil liberties, and the promise of a better life for their children.&quot; Discontent over the corruption and violence of post-colonial rulers, Nzongola says, has inspired movements to achieve &quot;a new and genuine independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent to which news from Africa is ignored by the U.S. press corps is as stunning as the events themselves. There has been scant attention or no mention at all in the major media of such dramatic developments as the daily pro-democracy demonstrations in Madagascar that brought hundreds of thousands of people into the streets; the arrival of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Western Sahara to supervise elections ending 16 years of war; or the military rebellion in Mali, where troops revolted against the killing of over 200 demonstrators and threw out the dictator who had ordered the crackdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Belgium, press reports about a Zaire government massacre of dissident university students in 1990 forced the Belgian government to cut aid to its former colony. The Bush administration, on the other hand, faces little public pressure to adapt its policies to the changing African scene. Although the U.S. has pressed for democratic reforms in a number of African countries, it has failed to satisfy critics that it has done enough to encourage authoritarian rulers with longstanding U.S. ties to step aside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. officials argue that the American government is doing as much as is appropriate. &quot;We have got to move away from this paternalism that we wear in the West that our system is best,&quot; says Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Leonard Robinson, when questioned about the U.S. role in Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves that has been devastated by civil war. &quot;Liberians,&quot; he says, &quot;should take the responsibility for solving their own problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem with that stance, say the critics, is that the U.S. is widely seen as blocking change, when it fails to give the nudge to despots it has kept in power. In countries like Zaire or Morocco or Liberia, the critics say, the U.S. has lost much of the esteem it once enjoyed. &quot;The Liberian people marched in Liberia and asked (former president Samuel) Doe to step down, placing themselves at severe risk,&quot; says Joyce Mends-Cole, a Liberian who works on women's issues for the United Nations. &quot;Where were Doe's arms coming from?  Most of the huge military arsenal came from the U.S. or was bought with U.S.  aid.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some Africans say the price of aid is too high and have pulled back from the process of seeking international support. The Six S Association, a rural peasant group based in Burkina Faso, is one of the fastest-growing organizations on the continent. With over 5,000 affiliate groups in Burkina Faso alone -- 60% of them headed by women -- Six S has spread to five nearby countries, taking along its message of self-reliance and grassroots democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever their approach, Africans face daunting challenges. Togolese lawyer Diyanama Ywassa welcomes the democratic changes in her country, but worries that public expectations have outpaced possibilities. &quot;I fear that many people think democracy is a magic word, that with democracy everything is going to change,&quot; she says. &quot;The long march to democracy is punctuated with difficulties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Few would disagree. But whatever the pitfalls along the road, there is no doubt that the journey is underway.  n</SPAN></P>
