<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (PANA) - The Angolan government and the former rebel group, UNITA, have agreed to establish a government of national unity and reconciliation on April 11, the UN announced Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN spokesman, Fred Eckhard, told correspondents that Secretary-General Kofi Annan had communicated the agreement to the Security Council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The formation of the government is a crucial aspect of the Lusaka Protocol, the peace accord signed in the Zambian capital in 1994 by UNITA and the Angolan government to end two decades of civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several attempts to establish the government in the past have failed due to UNITA's failure to send all its designated representatives in the proposed government to Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eckhard quoted the secretary-general, who recently visited Angola, as saying that the decision to establish the unity government was a boost for the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secretary-general feels that while there are still significant aspects of the peace agreement to implement...the peace process is back on track,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan convinced the UNITA leader, Jonas Savimbi, to send the representatives to Luanda when he visited Angola from March 22-24 as part of his African trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Security Council has welcomed the decision to form the government on April 11, and voted to renew the mandate of the more than 6,000 UN peacekeepers in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The short renewal is to enable the council to closely monitor the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - At least 200 African policy makers, university rectors and researchers began in Dakar on Tuesday a regional consultation aimed at shaping the continent's higher education agenda in the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting, attended by ministers from virtually all sub-saharan African states, is to be officially opened on Tuesday afternoon by the Senegalese president, Abdou Diouf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Federico Mayor, the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), which is funding the meeting, will make a keynote address during the consultation's official opening.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting is part of Africa's preparations for the September 1998 World Conference on Higher Education in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his intervention during the meeting's first general discussion, Zambia's minister of higher education, Syamukayumbo Siamujaye, criticized international donors, saying they denied funds to higher education so as to make African states perpetually dependent on Western aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the structural adjustment programmes had aggravated the situation of higher education in most of the African states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siamujaye appealed to UNESCO to take action to redress the situation which he termed as a &quot;conspiracy&quot; by international donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Cameroonian minister of higher education, Peter Agbo Tabi, suggested that the Dakar meeting would have been worthwhile if finance ministers were also invited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that African states will not achieve the scientific and technological progress for the 21st century if policy makers continued to deny funds to the higher education sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another speaker, Prof. Eshiwani George of Kenyatta University in Kenya called for a re-orientation of the continent's education system towards mathematics and science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the neglect of these subjects risked to marginalize the continent even further in the next century's scientific and technological progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penda Mbow, from the University of Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, decried the marginalization of women academicians, especially in Francophone African universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She appealed to UNESCO to redress the situation so that women can also participate fully in the decision making process of academic institutions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Zimbabwe Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ZIMACE) has expressed optimism about the possibility of another successful marketing season this year despite the cloud of uncertainty that currently shrouds crop estimates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZIMACE administrator Ian Goggin said on Tuesday, while there was still uncertainty in the market, particularly in the case of maize, indications were that trading would be heavy this year, buoyed by firming commodity prices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for maize, Goggin said most prices were expected to remain bullish, continuing last year's trend which saw prices performing above expectation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All things being equal, we expect a large crop this year, especially for soybeans and wheat, and we are more than ready to handle what comes our way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outbreak of grey leaf spot and frog eye diseases, which hit most parts of Zimbabwe, is expected to have a considerable negative impact on maize forcing farmers to revise their estimates downwards by about 25 percent of total output for the crop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, crop forecasts indicated that Zimbabwe's maize production in 1996/97 would surpass the 2.6 million tons produced last year and come close to the three-million ton mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soybean is projected to reach 120,000 tons, up from last year's 53,000 tons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, statistics released last week show that commercial farmers are expecting another bumper harvest this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, 258,000 tons of seed cotton were expected from both large and small scale farmers, coffee production is forecast at 12,000 tons while milk production was estimated to exceed 195 million liters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The World Bank and International Monetary Fund need to be more flexible if Africa is to benefit from their initiative for debt relief, a senior U.N. official has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, Kingsley Amoako, was speaking Monday at the opening of the Conference of African Finance Ministers, organized by the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amoako, the organization's executive-secretary, said if the debt relief effort was implemented without flexibility, &quot;it would end up like the mountain that gave birth to a mouse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's total debt was estimated at 340 billion U.S. dollars as at the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative to reduce this significantly was launched in September 1996.  It concerns relief for the highly indebted poor countries. Amoako said the World Bank and the IMF had done well in &quot;moving ahead&quot; with the initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said assuming the effort achieved its objective, &quot;a final concern would be how to make sure Africa does not find herself in the same situation in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the decision of the ministerial conference on the initiative would form the basis for further interaction between African countries, the donor community and multilateral financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference documents say that nine of the 42 sub-Sahara African countries are relatively free of external debt. They state that 32 countries are moderately indebted and the remaining 11 highly indebted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 33 countries expected to benefit from the initiative, 16 are potentially eligible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian troops on peace-keeping operations in Liberia have been barred from marring Liberian women, Nigeria's semi-official newspaper, Daily Times, reported Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You get married to a Liberian, you discharge from the army and leave the barracks a freeman,&quot; Maj. Gen. Victor Malu said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing Malu, the force commander of West African troops Peace Monitoring Force in Liberia, it said he was speaking with Nigerian journalists on a conducted tour of operations carried out by the force, known as Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a correspondent of News Agency of Nigeria, who was among the entourage, said the warning was an existing army regulation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HWANGE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Emerging from near extinction, Zimbabwe's black rhino population is now increasing by at least 10 percent annually, due to an improved habitat and increased security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporting this Monday, the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency quoted the warden for Sinamatella Intensive Protection Zone Camp in the Hwange National Park, Norman English, as saying that extensive security measures had resulted in zero poaching activities in the area for the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can assure that the problem of poaching is under control because of increased patrols,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe Defence Forces are helping in controlling the poaching under a programme code named &quot;Operation heritage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Parks Department and its associates is effectively monitoring poaching activities using helicopters and foot patrols,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the country's black rhino are located in the camp. Citing security reasons, English would not give the current figure of rhinos at the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The total number of rhinos in the park is classified information,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all of Zimbabwe, there is an estimated 300 rhinos out of a population of 2,000 just a few years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Matabeleland North Provincial Warden Donald Mutape said the dehorning of the black rhino had been stopped as a policy issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is need to research on the full impact of the dehorning exercise before it is continued,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dehorning was used as a means of discouraging poachers which sought the horns. Now, Mutape said, only the rhino collaring exercise is being applied to ensure detection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutape said five white and one black rhinos remained in the rest of Hwange National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although poaching is under control, five elephants were killed in 1997.  Mutape said elephant poaching was minimal because of the risks involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bearing in mind the huge national parks area under our jurisdiction, the problem of poaching is well under control,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - The first official trip to Africa by Kofi Annan, as United Nations secretary-general, since assuming office in January, was a big success his spokesman, Fred Eckhard, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eckhard told PANA in New York that the breakthroughs in the Angolan peace process and the crisis in the Great Lakes region marked the highlights of the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For those two reasons, it was substantively a successful trip,&quot; Eckhard said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan returned to New York on Friday, after an 11-day trip that took him to South Africa, Namibia, Angola and Lome, where he attended a summit of the Organisation of African Unity's central organ for conflict resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, he met with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi and convinced him to end the stalemate in establishing a government of national unity. He also persuaded Savimbi to reconcile with the Luanda authorities by sending UNITA representatives to join the proposed government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With UNITA representatives now in the Angolan capital, the U.N. announced Monday that the government would be established April 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formation of the government would mark the high-point of the implementation of the Lusaka protocol, the peace agreement signed by the parties in 1994 to end two decades of civil war in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The secretary-general feels that while there are still significant aspects of the peace agreement to implement, the peace process is back on track,&quot; Eckhard said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the Lome summit, the Zairian government and the rebel forces, who have been fighting since October agreed, to meet this weekend for talks in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eckhard described this deal as the &quot;second gratifying aspect of the secretary-general's trip.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will be presided over by Mohammed Sahnoun, the Algerian diplomat who is the joint representative of the Organization of African Unity and the U.N., within the framework of the U.N. peace plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five-point plan includes an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of all external forces from the region, protection of refugees and displaced people, respect of Zaire's sovereignty and the convening of an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - 1. PETITION AGAINST PRESIDENT CHILUBA REKINDLES POLITICAL DEBATE: The resumption of the petition by some opposition parties against President Chiluba's identity has renewed political debate in the country over presidential qualifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The petitioners contend that President Chiluba is not a born Zambian and should therefore have been disqualified from contesting the republican presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witness have started testifying in the case, including Luka Kafupi, a man claiming to be Chiluba's biological father. However, along with the case come many conflicting statements from the hordes of witnesses, the latest being a one who stated that President Chiluba's father was actually a Mozambican.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. ZDC COMES BACK TO LIFE: After four months of self-imposed 'hibernation' following a devastating election defeat, the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has began to show signs of coming back to life. The party which had hoped to win or at least get a respectable number of parliamentary seats after last November's elections, has began holding provincial party elections which will lead to national elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Party president Dean Mung'omba said that the ZDC still had the potential to be in government and that now was the time to begin serious preparations for the 2001 presidential and parliamentary elections. He also said that if the last elections had not been rigged, as has been alleged, the ZDC would have been in power today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. STAGE SET FOR THREE-SEAT PARLIAMENTAY BY-ELECTIONS: The MMD's popularity will be subjected to another test next month when three parliamentary by- elections will be held to fill seats that fell vacant after the deaths of the incumbents - all of whom were MMD members of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The test will, however, be somewhat eased for the MMD because the major party, UNIP, has resolved not to take part in any election because they contend the 1991 elections were rigged.  Other parties like the National Party, which has five seats in parliament, has said it would take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD is unlikely to have any difficulty in reclaiming the Petauke seat in the Eastern Province and the Mwembeshi seat in Central Province. But the contest for the Zambezi East seat in the North Western Province is expected to be tough particularly because the NP is fairly strong in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. ZAIRE CONFLICT CONTINUES TO WORRY ZAMBIANS: The escalated war in Zaire, Zambia's northern neighbour, has heightened concern in the country because of the fear that Zambia would not be able to cope with an anticipated influx of refugees and fleeing solders. Government has already made preparations to evacuate Zambians at the Embassy in Kinshasa and at the consulate in Lumumbashi, Zaire's second largest city which is under serious threat of being captured by rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The greatest fear, however, is that the fleeing Zairean soldiers could easily come into Zambia with their arms and increase the already high crime rate in the Copperbelt Province, which borders Zaire's Shaba Province, the new focal point of the rebel advances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. THE BLIND REFUSE TO BE REPATRIATED: Blind people with no jobs but who earn their living through begging on the streets in towns and cities of the country, have refused to be repatriated to their home villages where they could live more decent lives. A spokesman for an association that looks into the interests of the blind, says that very few, if any of the blind men and women would agree to go back to their respective home villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seek Peace Association chairman, Joseph Sakala, says even if the blind would want to go back to their homes, there was no guarantee that their lives would change for the better because many of their relatives were ignoring them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, several attempts have been made to repatriate the blind, but many of them have returned to the cities where there has been an extensive campaign discouraging people from giving alms to beggars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. NEW EXPORT/IMPORT ROUTE CHEERS TRADERS: Zambian traders have been cheered by the reopening of the railway route from Zambia, eastwards through Malawi to the Mozambican port city of Beira. The traders hope the re-opening of the route will provide a relatively cheaper alternative export and import route for goods to and from Asia, the Middle East and the Far East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, the main routes have been the northwards railway to the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam and the road southwards to South African ports. The traders also hope that the Zambian government will quickly rehabilitate the road from Lusaka to Chipata, the Eastern Province capital which links the Beira railway line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. RIVER WEED SPREADS AS SOLUTION FOR ERADICATION ELUDES EXPERTS: A notorious weed that is choking several parts of Zambia's third largest River, the Kafue, is still a menace. It is now believed to have spread to the largest river, the Zambezi. A new chemical has just been applied to a portion of the weeds on an experimental basis but there is not definite whether this latest of many experiments will solve the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The weed has been seen in some parts of the Zambezi River, and particularly near the Kariba Dam which generates most of Zambia's electricity needs. It is feared that if the weed is not controlled quickly near the dam, it could adversely affect electricity supply to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. ZAMBIANS FEAR FOR NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM TO PLAY IN ZAIRE: Many Zambians, including officials of the Football Association of Zambia, fear for the safety of the national soccer team which is scheduled to play a World Cup qualifying match in war-torn Zaire on April 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Football Association had been hoping that FIFA, the world soccer governing body, would shift the venue of the match from the Zairean capital Kinshasa to another country, but FIFA has insisted that the match be played in Zaire. The concern now is that some key Zambian players, especially those based abroad, would refuse to travel for the match. Already the captain of the side, Kalusha Bwalya, has indicated that he might not be available for the match.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - A woman raped and then strangled, a house broken into and all the occupants shot dead, a grandmother and her three grandchildren found murdered with some of their organs missing, and a jilted woman pours boiling cooking oil on her lover to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An increase in such grisly crimes has Zambians split in their opinions as to the abolishment of the death penalty. Whenever the subject is discussed, no conclusive resolution is reached with often the only agreement being to agree to disagree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation when the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) came into power in 1991, there has been pressure on the government to abolish the 'un-Christian' death penalty. This 'Christian voice' however, was not loud enough when the Constitution Review Commission sat to receive submissions reviewing the republican constitution in 1992-94. The death penalty was retained for those convicted of treason, murder or aggravated robbery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years were to pass, however, before President Chiluba would assent to the first executions. In January this year, along with the release of some 600 prisoners in a presidential amnesty to mark the opening of parliament, the announcement was made of the execution of eight convicts. The Zambia charter of Amnesty International condemned the executions, as did some other local human rights organisations, saying the age of capital punishment was long gone and Zambia too should do away with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today the debate is becoming more tense. The Christian community is pressuring for the abolition of the &quot;inhuman and barbaric&quot; practice while pressure from the opposing view seems too strong to be ignored by the government. Father Peter Henroit of the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection said: &quot;the resumption of capital executions is unnecessary and is not in agreement with basic Christian values nor with the justice and peace of the Gospel of Jesus.&quot; He said the death penalty cannot serve as a deterrent to criminal activity because &quot;there is no proven connection between executing criminals and restraining or preventing future criminal activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said that the agony of the innocent subjected to violent crime is not lessened by &quot;violently killing other persons&quot;. Executions in Zambia are by hanging. Father Henroit contends that &quot;official killings&quot; are an affront against the human dignity of both those on whom this is inflicted and those in whose name it is employed. He also argues that capital punishment is sometimes effected on innocent people and, seemingly, especially the poorer members of society who cannot afford competent legal defence in court proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says that the death penalty has no place in modern standards of governance and that Zambia should take a leaf from South Africa which abolished the death penalty with the fall of apartheid. &quot;Executions occur today only in dictatorial states such as Nigeria, fundamentalist states such as Saudi Arabia and violent states such as the USA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points out that as a Christian state, Zambia should adhere to Bible principles and teachings which include compassion, forgiveness of sinners, forgiveness of enemies, being non-vengeful, non-condemning and non-violent.  He notes: &quot;Surely in a country like Zambia that claims to be a Christian nation, the execution by the death penalty has no place whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A renowned psychiatrist agrees that the death penalty must be abolished.  Not so much because Zambia is Christian nation, but because, he believes, a majority of persons convicted commit the crimes when they are not in the right frame of mind. Professor Haworth, who has dealt with the cases of over 250 death row convicts, notes that from the time a person commits a crime to the time that he or she is hanged, there is a notable difference in character.  This, he contends, reflects that the person being sent to the gallows is not necessarily the same person (mentally), who committed the crime. Among the death-row convicts who have gone through his therapy is Edward Shamwana who was convicted for treason but pardoned by then president, Kenneth Kaunda, in 1991. Shamwana is now chairman of one of Zambia major opposition political parties, the National Party, and a renowned lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A representative of the Law Development Commission says that Zambians should not be driven by the motive of revenge but should reflect on the consequences of such a punishment. Dr Kabange Sipula argues that capital punishment &quot;is the ultimate organised crime by the state&quot; and should be done away with. He agrees with Father Henriot that &quot;democracy is about a gentle society&quot;.  He adds that &quot;judges are not mortal gods who know what is best for human life&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those in support of the death penalty are just as vehement. A Lusaka lawyer, John Kasaila, argues that the only solution to the control of murder is by killing those who commit the crimes because for now there was no other way out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lawyer, Lee Habasonda, agrees and adds that Zambia is not ready for the abolition of capital punishment. He says: &quot;We are a poor country. We cannot maintain a prison on the expense of innocent people.&quot; He argues that a person who has no respect for another person's life does not deserve to live.  He adds: &quot;Until such a time when Zambia attains a level of (financial) stability, we cannot import the concept (of abolishing capital punishment).  Executions are not a new or strange thing, but a form of cleansing of unnecessary characters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior member of the ruling MMD also argues for the maintaining of the death penalty. Paul Tembo, the MMD national vice-secretary and a former deputy finance minister, says there is no proof that prisons in Zambia serve as reformatories. He says that prison in Zambia is meant to punish convicts and so saw no reason why someone sentenced to death should be kept in prison for long. Tembo, a Christian, also points out that it was also important to consider what effect the keeping alive of a convict would be on a society that knows this person as a serial killer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another lawyer, Richard Mukelabai, who was a commissioner of the Constitution Review Commission, is even more angry with those who contend that executions should be abolished. He says: &quot;These criminals are lucky I don't have a gun. Every Zambian must be armed to protect himself otherwise Zambia will operate by the law of the jungle.&quot; But Professor Haworth argues that the best way of reducing crime in the country is not by arming its citizens, but by having a well-managed and well-equipped police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ordinary Zambian has, however, taken the issue in his own hands as has been witnessed recently when the death penalty was effected without having to take culprits to court. Robbery suspects, if caught, are usually beaten or burnt to death if the police do not arrive on the scene on time to save them.  Although cases of mob justice, especially that of burning suspects, is somewhat on the wane, many people still believe in beating up thieves, or killing them if possible, because of the dissatisfaction with some court sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While government is concerned about the evident rise in murder cases, it is also hearing the cry to abolish the death penalty. And this especially with Zambia being a signatory to the international covenant on civil and political rights which supports the right to life and in consequence the abolition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1991 and 1995, 3,488 persons were murdered and of these only 167 were female victims. During the same period, those killed by firearms was 1, 915 and aggravated robberies recorded totalled 14,621.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry of Home Affairs permanent secretary, Kalambo Mwansa, notes that since Zambia is a signatory to the covenant, &quot;it is under obligation to progressively bring about the abolition of the death penalty, but this should be done by also ensuring that measures to satisfactorily protect and compensate victims of crime and abuse of power are progressively implemented as required by international law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The progress in which this law is implemented, however, remains to be seen.  Although the MMD government has an overwhelming majority in parliament, a position which would normally pave the way for an easy enactment of a law to abolish the death penalty, the circumstances over the issue are not, per se, political. There are bound to be deep divisions, and arguments, for or against, would be across political allegiances. Against this background, it may still be some time before Zambia finally abolishes the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - Thirty-three people accused of alleged involvement in the murder and brutal physical damage of many persons here in Woreda 25 of the capital were tried yesterday at the Federal High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged culprits include Ato Muluneh Mengistu, then chairman of the woreda revolutionary guard and member of the campaign coordination committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first bench of the Federal High Court levelled 15 different types of charges against the alleged culprits whom it accused of totally or partially murdering members of a certain political circle by organising campaign coordination committee authority in the woreda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the charge document of the Special Prosecutor, the defendants had prepared investigation and torturing centres in all kebeles in the woreda, organised search and death squads and thereby accused internal and external bodily harms to persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the defendants are two women who, the Special Prosecutor believes, had allegedly caused severe bodily harm to persons by slashing them tying hand-to-leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court, based on the demand of defendants for government-sponsored defence lawyers, has ordered the Prison Administration to prove whether the persons are financially capable to hire lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Special Prosecutor said only 22 of the accused were present at yesterday's court proceeding, urging that arrest warrants be issued to police to bring the remaining ones to a court of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court has accepted the appeal on the issuance of arrest warrants and adjourned the trial to May 30.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of the Truth And Reconciliation Commission, on the launch of the TRC's designated statement-taking programme in Durban, April 1, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission today announces a major drive to ensure that every South African who was a victim of a gross violations of human rights during the apartheid era has an opportunity to relate his or her story to the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is using R2,4 million in donor funding to enter into partnerships with Non-Governmental Organisations around the country so that we can launch an extensive campaign to gather statements from people in communities throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between now and the end of June, up to 300 &quot;Designated Statement-Takers&quot; from NGOs will join the TRC's statement-takers in reaching out to thousands of South Africans. Until now, most of the approximately 9,000 statements which have been given to the Commission have been collected by our own statement-takers. Individuals will also be able to fill out statement forms on their own.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The campaign will help the Commission to fulfil the mandate laid down by Parliament in the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act. This law, which established the Commission, requires us to --</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Establish &quot;as complete a picture as possible of the causes, nature and extent of gross violation of human rights&quot; during the apartheid era, and to Facilitate &quot;the gathering of information and the receiving of evidence from any person, including persons claiming to be victims of such violations...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While most people know the Commission through the widely-publicised hearings in which victims relate their experiences, in fact the public hearings make up only one part of the work of the Human Rights Violations Committee. For every one person who gives testimony, there are five others who have given us statements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every statement given to the Commission enjoys the same status, whether or not the person who has made it appears at a hearing. Most important in the long term, it is the making of an accurate statement to the Commission -- and not an appearance at a public hearing -- which qualifies a victim to be taken into account for the reparations and rehabilitation measures which Parliament will decide upon after the Commission finishes its work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DST programme will be co-ordinated by a Community Liaison Officer in each of the Commission's four regional offices. It is being made possible by funding provided by the Ministry of the Flemish Community of Belgium, and we thank the Belgian Government -- and its Ambassador in South Africa -- warmly for their support. We are particularly grateful for their concern that everyone making a statement should be able to do so in their mother tongue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on the experience of our own statement-takers, the Designated Statement Takers from NGOs will be trained to receive the stories of people's experiences. These DSTs will be based in the offices of the relevant local organisations and will therefore be more accessible to members of the public.  People will be able to recount their experiences in their preferred language, and the DSTs will record them in English in the necessary format for the date- processing requirements of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are deeply grateful for the willingness of NGOs to enter into agreements with us to carry out this campaign. It is an indication of the premium we place on our relationship with NGOs -- and of our belief in their central role in civil society -- that we are relying largely on them for the implementation of this crucial project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The TRC is approaching the final stages of its term of operation. It is now more important than ever that every person, institution and organisation which may have information about gross violations of human rights furnishes it to us without delay. If we are to present as complete a picture as possible about gross violations of human rights, then individuals, NGOs, political parties and community organisations must make information at their disposal available to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission has deliberately chosen KwaZulu-Natal for the launch of this project, because it is here in particular that we have found that people have been slow to come forward to make statements, either because they are fearful or because of the remoteness of some areas from urban centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have made some important progress in persuading the Inkatha Freedom Party to assist by presenting their viewpoints to us: the leader of the IFP made an extensive presentation to us last year; IFP members, albeit in limited numbers, have made statements about the violations they have suffered; and recently we had a breakthrough when IFP members on the East Rand came forward to give us their perspectives on that conflict. In addition, the IFP will encourage its members to come forward to be considered for reparation and rehabilitation measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, we have also had setbacks: we have had to cancel a special hearing devoted to atrocities carried out by ANC supporters in KwaZulu-Natal because of lack of co-operation from within IFP structures. This hearing, scheduled for this month, was to have been the first devoted solely to violations committed by supporters of one party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission does not belong to the Commissioners, or to any group, or even to the parties which constituted the Government of National Unity when the Commission was established. It belongs to the nation, and it is the nation's instrument for building national unity and reconciliation. We cannot present a balanced picture of the past if we receive information only from a limited range of sources or organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We make a special appeal to those who have not yet done so: come and make your statement to the Commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency for International Development, Bureau For Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) , ZAIRE - Complex Emergency, Fact Sheet 7, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 April 1, 1997. Note: The last fact sheet was dated March 27, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background: In mid-October, 1996 fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance gaining territory on all fronts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance now controls the eastern fifth of Zaire. On March 15, the Alliance captured Kisangani, an important commercial and strategic military center and forces are advancing towards Lubumbashi. Both President Mobutu Sese Seko and Kabila sent representatives to an OAU summit on Zaire which began on March 26 in Lome, Togo. Both sides agreed in principle to a ceasefire and negotiations, subject to consultations with authorities in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected: The initial fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 890,000 Rwandans to return to Rwanda, 64,000 Burundians to repatriate and hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. There are 39,000 registered internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kisangani. Missionary sources report that 4,000 IDPs have left Kisangani to return home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent estimates of the scattered refugee concentrations include: 6,000 - 8, 000 in Punia; up to 3,000 in Lodja, 250 km west of Kindu; 274 in Tingi Tingi camp; and another 1,700 in Amisi. Refugees are clustered at three main points along the 125 km rail line west of the Zaire river: approximately 26,000 are gathered at Lula, seven km south of Kisangani; some 25,000 are clustered at the village of Kisesa, near km 25; and another 30,000, including several thousand unaccompanied children, are at the Village of Bar, near km 41. Local villagers report that less than 100 refugees remain between km 52 and km 82.  Press sources reported on March 31 that approximately 30,000 Rwandan refugees appeared 50 km west of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Humanitarian Situation: The refugees at Lula are in relatively good condition and have received food and water. However, Alliance military authorities insist that the refugees must be moved further south for security reasons. At km 25, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are developing water sources and providing medical services to refugees. Many of the refugees at km 41 appear severely malnourished and are unable to walk any farther.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very few refugees there have cooking posts, plastic sheeting, and other personal items. The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) provided dry food rations to the refugees at km 41 on March 30 via the local Red Cross. At km 52, two small family units are receiving WFP rations, water, and other assistance from local church groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On March 31, a medical team was sent to retrieve refugees south of km 52, who are reportedly in serious condition. According to refugees, the former Rwandan army (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe militia members have separated from the refugees gathered along the rail line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP reports sufficient food stocks, including a barge which is traveling up the Zaire river toward Kisangani, with 260 metric tons (MT) of food. The foraging of the refugees, ex-FAR, and Interahamwe affected villages between Ubundu and km 52. WFP plans to provide food for work distributions to affected populations, in exchange for help in improving the road parallel to the railway line. The U.N. Coordinator for eastern Zaire, Filippo Grandi, is seeking Kabila's approval to repatriate refugees by air and road through Kisangani. The Government of Rwanda has requested a tripartite agreement with the Alliance and UNHCR governing the repatriation of refugees. In the meantime, UNHCR is planning the repatriation logistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Assistance: On March 14, USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) arrived in the region to help advance relief efforts in eastern Zaire. USAID/DART has recently installed an information officer in Nairobi and a field officer in Goma. On March 30, USAID/DART visited major refugee concentrations along the railway line south of Kisangani, accompanied by WFP and Alliance officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BHR/OFDA and the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM) have provided funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist internally displaced Zairians and repatriating Rwandan refugees. State/PRM has also approved a $3 million contribution to UNHCR for repatriating refugees. Between December and February, BHR's Office of Food for Peace provided roughly 1600 MT of food to eastern Zaire from the Rwanda Regional Program.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Leading African finance policy makers, including ministers of finance and central bank governors, grappled today with top policy makers from the World Bank, IMF and the African Development Bank (ADB) over the African debt problem at the Headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The centre-piece of discussion was the debt initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs), launched by the World Bank and IMF in September 1996 in agreement with major bilateral creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Initiative targets 41 of the world's most highly indebted countries, 33 of which are in Africa, but is by no means the first instrument to address the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the high-level panel of participants agreed that HIPCs showed a high degree of commitment compared to past efforts aimed at solving the African debt problem, they expressed deep concern at:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- restrictive eligibility conditions at the entry and decision points;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- macroeconomic and financial programme targets, conditionality and performance criteria;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- treatment of market and non-market exogenous factors in policy performance evaluation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- failure to mainstream the government budget constraint and domestic debt in the policy simulation, debt sustainability studies;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- length of the work-out - six years;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- commitment, adequacy and timing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank and the IMF, in a bid to clarify misperceptions surrounding the Initiative, stressed that -- contrary to what they might have heard in the past -- there is to date no list drawn up of eligible countries. All that exists is a set of criteria for eligibility which is open to review and amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, there was no intention on the part of the multilateral institutions to treat African countries as a herd. Well aware of the peculiarities of each, the two would lean backwards to accommodate as many countries as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue here was the Ministers' concern that the ranges of debt-to-export (200-250 per cent) and debt-service-to-export (20-25 per cent) precluded some deserving African countries from qualifying for the Initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two multilateral institutions responded that the ranges suggested were not written on stone tablets and were amenable to review taking into consideration the macroeconomic situation of countries including the availability of adequate bilateral financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers were particularly vocal on the question of debt-to-export ratios, arguing that their commodity exports were dominated by multinationals to whom accrued a large proportion of export earnings. The World Bank and IMF should therefore desist from considering the market value of exports in their calculations, said the ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The response here was that the World Bank and IMF would consider the following factors:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- fiscal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- export concentration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- fragility of exports, etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the burning question of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA), Ministers were reasonably mollified when the two Bretton Woods representatives disclosed that this was subject to efficacy of multilateral mechanisms that included recipient governments along with the World Bank and IMF. And it was a given, they added, that all creditors should be fully involved in the consultative process. Above all, the two multilateral institutions insisted, in the final analysis the Initiative belonged to governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of financing the two institutions disclosed that to date the World Bank has earmarked US$500 million for the Initiative, and bilateral donors US$ 543 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The genesis of the Initiative was the World Bank and Fund's belief that traditional debt relief mechanisms had proved inadequate. Among them:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Baker Plan of 1985 which envisaged new lending by commercial banks of US$7 billion annually during the plan period (1986-88) basically to refinance interest;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Brady Initiative of 1989 calling for official support for countries to finance the restructuring of commercial bank debt;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Brady Plan of 1990 involving just 2.2 per cent, of Sub-Saharan African total outstanding debt of US$280.5 billion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Toronto and Houston Terms (1988-91) offering partial write-offs of up to 33 per cent in present value terms, longer maturities of 25 years, longer grace periods of up to 14 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective was to reduce the net present value of rescheduled debt by up to one third;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- London Terms (Enhanced Toronto - 1991-1994) which incorporated enhanced concessions in rescheduling for low income countries, most of them in Africa: 50 per cent reduction in net present value terms through outright cancellation of 50 per cent of the consolidated non-Official Development Assistance (ODA) claims, or debt service reduction on the consolidated debt among other concessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Naples of 1995 and Lyons Terms of 1996 in which terms were revised to increase the percentage reduction for eligible non-ODA debt to 67 per cent in net present value terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- Multilateral creditors have participated in the international effort to alleviate debt through technical support and in the form of collateral funds to accelerate market-based restructuring transaction such as the ODA Debt Reduction Facility, accelerated concessional financing of poor, debt- burdened countries in the form of SAF, ESAF facilities of the IMC and IDA supplemental credits under the Fifth Dimension Facility (FDF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministers, aware that scarce foreign exchange resources have to be allocated to service external debt, considered the potential of debt conversions. The region has received only 5 per cent of the 114 billion disbursed between 1985 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussions crystallized in the perception that debt conversions were flexible and adaptable management tools that could target specific areas and encourage private investment, support export diversification and galvanize international assistance while facilitating research in key areas of interest to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those taking part in today's panel discussions on HIPCs included: UN ECA Executive Secretary K.Y. Amoako (who is hosting the conference); Uganda's Finance and Economic Planning minister J. Mayanja-Nkangi; World Bank vice- president (Africa region) Jean-Louis Sarbib; ADB vice-president Ferhat Lounes; and IMF Deputy Director (Africa region) A. Basu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another panel session deliberated on Emerging Capital Markets in Africa - Challenges and Opportunities (see Press Release No. 7).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference ends tomorrow, with a wrap-up of panel discussions, presentation of the rapporteurs' reports, adoption of the report of the meeting of intergovernmental group of experts, and adoption of the conference resolutions and declaration on Africa's Debt, Emerging Capital Markets, Financial Sector Reforms and Growth and Development Finance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - African Ministers of Finance, central bank governors and finance experts today conducted their first ever debate on capital markets developments at the Headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sixth Session of the Conference of African Ministers of Finance, in its second day, has had the benefit of interaction between some of the top policy makers from the World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank (ADB), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and leaders from major stock markets in the USA, Europe and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date Africa has 16 stock exchanges. Most are less than 10 years old. Sub- Saharan markets are more recent, 8 of them having been established in the last 8 years.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference noted that new markets were likely to emerge in such countries as Uganda, Angola, Madagascar and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African markets have made significant progress. Improvements have been recorded in such indicators as market capitalization and trading value -- which grew by 73.5% and 152.7% respectively in the 5 years ending 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, a number of African markets have continued to make impressive price advances, falling within the top 10 best performing markets in US Dollar terms. In 1995, Cote d'Ivoire was the best performing global market.  Six of the best ten performing markets led by Kenya were African.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Interest in African markets is clearly rising as several investment funds with focus on Africa have been established in the last few years. Among them the African Investment Fund, Alliance Capital (an American investment company) , Robert Fleming (a British merchant bank), and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That interest has been basically driven by reforms, growth in some countries and the economic prospect of the region&quot;, said Mr. Akamiokhor, Director-General of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conference is well aware that these positive developments notwithstanding, African markets are relatively small, illiquid, indeed at the rudimentary stage of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total number of listings in African markets -- at under 2,000 -- is barely 10 per cent and less than 5 percent of emerging markets and world listings respectively. Egypt and South Africa control 60% of listings and, with Nigeria, account for about 75% of total listings on the continent. India, with its 6,000 listed companies is three times the size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These figures illustrate the fact that the limited number of listings and the small size of the companies simply do not provide enough choice for investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A contributory factor is the tendency for African businesses to remain within families. The problem is worsened by the trend of envisaged privatization of state-owned enterprises -- particularly public utilities -- as well as the education of local entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts agreed that measures that governments could take to hasten the maturity of African stock exchange markets include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">- strengthening the legal and regulatory framework - establishing a proper institutional framework (the existence of certain financial institutions is vital for the functioning of a capital market and the financial market as a whole - training of markets intermediaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Creating the enabling environment for investment, both domestic and foreign is very crucial for the development of African economies.  This last must also include an efficient capital markets in which investors are protected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants in the session included: Chasteau de Baylon, vice minister of Finance, Mauritius; Dr Lemma W. Senbet, University of Maryland; Leon Naka, Chairman, Abidjan Stock Exchange; Eric Postel of Pangaea Partners, U.S.A.; Arnold Ekpe, Chief Executive Officer, ECO Bank, Togo; George Akamiokhor, Director-General, Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria; and Stephen Starnes, Managing Director, Van Eck Global, Prudential Securities Incorporated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another panel session deliberated on: Challenges of the African Debt Problem (see Press Release No. 6).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference ends tomorrow, with a wrap-up of panel discussions, presentation of the rapporteurs' reports, adoption of the report of the meeting of intergovernmental group of experts, and adoption of the conference resolutions and declaration on Africa's Debt, Emerging Capital Markets, Financial Sector Reforms and Growth and Development Finance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - This article reports on an outbreak of O'nyong-nyong (ONN) fever that was first noted in June 1996, in the Rakai District in south-central Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early February 1997, a new focus of suspected fever cases in west- central Uganda was reported and by late February, similar unconfirmed reports were received from western Kenya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ONN virus is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that, during 1959-1962, caused a central African pandemic which began in northern Uganda and ultimately involved an estimated 2 million persons in an area extending from Mozambique to Senegal. Geographical extension of the epidemic is thought to have been largely due to the movement of viremic humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although mortality due to ONN fever was never documented, short-term morbidity was significant. The primary epidemic mosquito vectors were shown to be the region's major malaria vectors, _Anopheles gambiae_ and _An.  funestus_. The natural reservoir hosts of ONN virus are unknown.</SPAN></P>

Some 10,000 mt provided by the Government and WFP is preparing an emergency operation for 11,000 mt; additional funding is needed to purchase, deliver and monitor the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) Two of the largest Sudanese refugee camps in northern Uganda virtually empty as an estimated 60,000 refugees leave to return to southern Sudan. b) Joint WFP, Government and donor mission to visit areas in the northern and eastern parts of the country, following a Government request for food assistance to drought-affected populations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 WFP and Operation Lifeline Sudan, which groups UN and NGO agencies in southern Sudan, began an emergency assessment mission to Yei district in southern Sudan on 24 March to assess food requirements for displaced Sudanese in the areas of Yei, Morobo and Kaya, in Eastern Equatoria region. Displaced have been trying to return to their homes following the recapture of these towns by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) over the past weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Meanwhile, as many as 60,000 refugees are thought to be returning to Sudan from Uganda, where the two largest refugee camps, Koboko (population 26, 516) and Ikafe (population 55,162), have virtually emptied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The SPLA's relief arm, the SRRA, reports that 40,000 returnees from Uganda and Zaire have been registered around Yei so far. A further 20,000-40, 000 refugees could be on their way back to Yei district, according to humanitarian reports. In addition to returning refugees, the SRRA report that 11,800 displaced civilians are in Yei town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 WFP has dispatched a total of 40 metric tons of maize to Yei, which is expected to arrive by truck on 27 March. Additional food will follow over the next few days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 Aid agencies working under Operation Lifeline Sudan are looking into providing seeds and tools to take advantage of southern Sudan's current planting season. Cultivation has just started and will continue through April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 WFP food stocks for displaced populations in southern Sudan and refugees in northern Uganda are at critically low levels and expected to be depleted by the end of the month. WFP is currently in discussions with donors in an effort to secure emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 Update as of 27 March: OLS reports up to 20,000 people in Yei urgently need food and medicine because of fighting when rebels seized the town on March 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE - most information as of 25 March</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Refugees in Ubundu have started to trek to Kisangani and a first group of some 10,000 people was detected just a few kilometres away from the city.  Reportedly, the refugees will not be allowed to enter the town. Humanitarian agencies had not been to Ubundu since the fall of Kisangani and the refugees, deprived of aid, began to move towards Kisangani. A joint WFP/UNHCR/DHA/OXFAM team and the Zairean Red Cross was granted authorisation to visit Ubundu on March 25. On the east bank of the Zaire River the mission found only some 100 unaccompanied children and 40 sick persons. The mission over-flew the west bank of the river and spotted tens of thousands of refugees at km 95 and km 82 (from Kisangani). Train operations from Kisangani to Ubundu were resumed on March 27; WFP had loaded 120 metric tons of food on the train, for distribution by Zairean Red Cross volunteers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP continues to provide assistance to refugees in Tingi Tingi and Amisi. Following a recommendation from medical workers, a wet feeding programme is to be implemented in all camps. Therefore, in addition to the high-protein biscuits, the food basket will now include pulses, vegetable oil, maize meal and salt. The caseload as of 22 March was 1,755 for Amisi and 319 for Tingi Tingi. Refugees in Tingi Tingi and newcomers continue to be directed to Amisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The air repatriation of unaccompanied children and vulnerable refugees from Tingi Tingi, Amisi and Kindu continues. After a brief stopover in Goma, the refugees are taken to Rwanda. So far 555 returnees have been repatriated and registered in Gisenyi. Displaced Zaireans who fled from eastern areas to Kisangani are also being transported by air to Goma. WFP is studying possibilities of using the Ilyushin 76 to transport refugees from Kisangani to Goma. The aircraft could carry 100 persons in each trip, which would facilitate and accelerate this programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 The WFP air shuttle from Mwanza in Tanzania to Kisangani continues to operate but the aircraft is not always accomplishing the planned two rotations per day. Between 19 -24 March a total 280 metric tons of food and one vehicle were delivered. There is a stock of 694 metric tons of food in Mwanza, sufficient for another 20 rotations. Commodity priorities as defined by WFP Kisangani are for high-protein biscuits, salt, cooking oil and corn soya blend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 On 21 March a UNHCR team carried out an assessment on the Amisi/Walikale road. The team evaluated road and security conditions. The road was found to be in good condition and passable during the rainy season, even along the poorer stretches. Security was reported by the team as satisfactory but local populations informed the team about the presence of armed groups of the former Rwandan army in the forests. No refugees were spotted along the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 In preparation for the reception of refugees, the number of way stations on the Kingulube road has been increased to five. The aim is to reinforce the presence of humanitarian agencies and set up assistance points every 20-40 km. WFP is releasing high-protein biscuits to CARE, IRC and MSF-H for distribution along the Kingulube axis. Between 17-23 March, 1,084 returnees received high-protein biscuits distributed by the Zairean Red Cross and the UNHCR repatriation team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) accepted an invitation to participate in the Lome OAU summit to discuss the crisis in eastern Zaire. The invitation to participate in the meeting came from the Togolese president and was delivered by the UN/OAU Special Representative for the Great Lakes Region, Mohamed Sahnoun, during his visit to Kisangani on 22 March. This is the first time that Zairean rebels have participated in an international forum to discuss the situation in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Preliminary findings from the Household Food Economy Analysis carried out by SCF in Byumba prefecture show that poor households are 20% to 30% worse off now than before the war, whether they are returnees or not. The report recommends continued food assistance. Meanwhile, market prices throughout the country continue to rise due to increased demand as a result of the mass repatriation from Zaire and Tanzania, combined with poor harvests in both Rwanda and southern Uganda, and trade embargoes with Burundi. Prices of staple food commodities have increased by 30% as compared to last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 Returnee figures for the period 15 to 21 March total 2,183 persons.  Despite the current insecurity in Eastern Zaire, repatriation figures have remained stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 FAO Rwanda reported that all prefectures have received 100% of the required bean seed, with the exception of Kibungo, where bean seed requirements have been met by only 54%. Distribution of sorghum seed and sweet potato cuttings has fallen short of requirements, with only 26% of sorghum and 10% of sweet potato needs met. FAO is concerned that this could seriously aggravate household food security as sweet potatoes are a staple food in the country, constituting a significant portion of the household food basket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Overnight attacks in regroupement camps in Buganda, Cibitoke province, left 135 people dead and many others injured. The attacks were allegedly carried out by Hutu rebels, and most of the victims were returnees who had repatriated from Zaire. These attacks are seen as an indication that the regroupement policy being implemented does not guarantee security to returnees and displaced populations in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 A joint WFP/FAO mission visited the provinces of Karuzi and Gitega. The situation prevailing in some of the camps for displaced and regrouped populations is described as appalling in terms of food, water and sanitation, particularly in Karuzi. Immediate assistance is required for these camps and a joint UN, NGO and donor meeting will be held on March 26 to discuss the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 African leaders will meet in Arusha, Tanzania on April 8, to analyse the situation in Burundi and evaluate the impact of the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi, following the July 1996 military coup d'etat. The meeting will analyse the measures so far taken by Burundi towards the establishment of a democratic environment, peace and reconciliation, as imposed by regional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA - DROUGHT SITUATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Some 3.9 million people in eleven regions of Tanzania are affected by drought. Based on the findings of the five WFP assessment teams who recently visited twelve regions, WFP estimates that of the total affected, relief food assistance is needed immediately by some 670,800 persons for a period of 120 days. Needs may increase, based on assessments being carried out in the remaining eight regions. Those people identified as in need of assistance are considered the poorest in the villages, with no access to food stocks, income or livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 Excessive sales of the 1996 harvest, failure of the short rains and the delayed onset of the long rains are the factors cited as responsible for the critical food shortages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Lack of water, rising cereal prices (when food is available), loss of livestock, dramatic decrease in livestock prices, migration and sale of household and personal belongings were witnessed by the assessment teams in most regions. Those interviewed said the drought was the worst in living memory, or, for the older people, comparable to 1974, when massive Government imports of food were required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 WFP has advised donors that some 33,000 mt of food are needed for immediate delivery to those people identified as the very poorest of the region's populations. Some 10,000 mt has been provided by the Government from the strategic grain reserve. WFP is currently preparing an emergency operation for 11,000 mt. Additional funding is needed to purchase, deliver and monitor the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.5 Arusha and Lindi regions reported to be the most critical, although food deliveries are now needed to all regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">E. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 As reported above, two of the largest Sudanese refugee camps in northern Uganda are now almost empty, and an estimated 60,000 refugees have left Uganda to return to border areas in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 A joint WFP, Government and donors mission will visit drought-affected areas in the northern and eastern parts of the country to evaluate the impact of poor rains and assess emergency food requirements for the area. This mission follows a Government request for food assistance to drought-affected populations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga premier, Mathews Phosa, lashed out at National Party (NP) politicians in the provincial legislature on Wednesday, accusing them of attempting to &quot;seduce me into political immaturity and conflict&quot; after they criticised his admin-istration's record over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning that if they continued to use &quot;vicious and unfounded half-truths&quot; to &quot;trick&quot; him into reacting, Phosa threatened to allow the ANC to expose the previous performance of NP members of the provincial legislature while they were office bearers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm warning you, unless we tango together, I will use fire to extinguish fire. I will not be seduced into betraying President Mandela's programmes of reconciliation and nation-building,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa was reacting to NP provincial whip, Chris MacPherson, who earlier criticised his 1997 policy speech by saying &quot;never before has anyone said so much which meant so little&quot;. Quoting from various of Phosa's speeches where the premier speaks strongly against corruption, MacPherson asked why none of the high profile officials and politicians who had defrauded the provincial government over the past two years had yet been prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the recent decision of the Mpumalanga Development Corporation (MDC) to abandon disciplinary action against its former CEO, Patrick Mogorosi, as an example, MacPherson said that the government was sending a clear message to citizens that it was either unable or unwilling to control corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The independent investigation into Mogorosi, which proved beyond a doubt that he was responsible for maladministration, cost the State at least R780 000 and now instead of prosecuting, the province allows him to resign and actually rewards him by giving him a package,&quot; said MacPherson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three previous CEOs, against who no charges or allegations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were ever brought, were simply dismissed without any form of compensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacPherson also questioned why the provincial government had ignored central government directives and the Steyn Commission on the Remuneration of Traditional Leaders by paying members of the House of Traditional Leaders higher salaries than any other region in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP also asked why the government was confusing investors and delaying the construction of the province's first international airport by giving support to two different and completing foreign schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite accusing MacPherson of gutter politics immediately after the allegations and of the warnings of severe ANC reaction on Wednesday, Phosa did not address the issues raised by MacPherson. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Despite striking similarities between a new ethnocentric tabloid planned for Durban and equally controversial plans by the Dolphin Group to launch two Indian market publications in the province, senior officials from both companies deny any links or cross funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mystery man behind the proposed 'The Asian' tabloid, Rahj Ramrachisingh, however conceded after an Mail &amp; Guardian investigation this week that there are at least social links between the him and Dolphin president, Ketan Somaia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia and Dolphin hit the headlines six months ago when M&amp;G reported on their multi-billion rand plans to buy commercial control of various Mpumalanga game reserves for 50-years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After admitting to knowing Somaia &quot;closely&quot;, Ramrachisingh, repeatedly refused to be named or too give any background on himself until M&amp;G revealed that it already knew his surname.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After grudgingly agreeing to a one-hour 'on-the-record' telephonic interview, he then insisted that his name should not appear in print.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirming that he was the only person authorised to speak to the press about The Asian, Ramrachisingh was unable to say why his name should not be printed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also refuted another senior staff member, identified only as &quot;small Rahj&quot; , who initially confirmed a link between the paper and Dolphin. The moment &quot; small Rahj&quot; confirmed the link, he was abruptly interrupted and told to transfer M&amp;G's call to &quot;big Rahj&quot; Ramrachisingh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he told you that we were connected to Dolphin, then he was mistaken.  Look, I do know Dolphin Group president Ketan Somaia very well - he is a very very close friend - but there is no financial relationship between us on this project,&quot; insisted Ramrachisingh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to say whether he was Somaia's business partner in any other ventures or why both his and Somaia's media plans in KwaZulu Natal were so similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia told M&amp;G two weeks ago that Dolphin intended launching a local edition of it's Indian focus daily newspaper, Asian Age, in South Africa within two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining that Asian Age already had international daily sales of 340 000 copies in Britain, the Middle East and India, Somaia said that the South African edition would at first only be a weekly and would be distributed nationwide after being printed in Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia described the paper as a &quot;hard-hitting, hard news publication&quot; which aimed at creating a voice for Indian communities in the countries it served, while also providing these communities with news from &quot;back home&quot; in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh described the The Asian as a &quot;hard-hitting tabloid with lots of investigative news designed for the Indian communities in South Africa&quot;.  His paper would also, he said, carry significant news from India but would focus primarily on southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Dolphin, The Asian will also print in Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town on a weekly basis at first, but would move towards becoming a daily as the market allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Dolphin and Ramrachisingh also plan to launch Indian market niche magazines within six months of launching their newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin's magazine is intended to be a South African version of their Cineblitz Indian movie magazine, described by Somaia as an &quot;incredibly popular 'Bollywood' glossy&quot;, concentrating on India's massive movie industry and the hundreds of stars and films it produces every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cineblitz, he said, has monthly sales of roughly 300 000 copies in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SA edition would include looks at local independent films and Somaia didn't dismiss the possibility of bringing India movies to South Africa via Dolphin's movie distribution subsidiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the launch and distribution strategies for Ramrachisingh's magazine are strikingly similar to Cineblitz's, its target market and name, Asian Business, are completely different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, we're just very good friends and we don't know each other's business plans. If there is any similarity, then it is just a coincidence and that's all,&quot; Ramrachisingh insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia was consistently unavailable for comment this week and Dolphin officials in South Africa said they had not yet been briefed on any publishing ventures, as these projects were run directly from Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh repeatedly stressed that the The Asian was being launched with &quot;clean&quot; South African money and management, but refused to say how much had been committed to the venture or who the investors were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also at first refused to say whether he was a South Africa citizen or not, despite his marked Francophone accent. Ramrachisingh later conceded that he was a Mauritius based import/ export businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin has significant interests in Mauritius, including a banking group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner of Asian News (Pty) Ltd is Sharmin Ramrachisingh, a South African lawyer. There are other investors but they are all also South African, &quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh refused to comment on whether he was directly related to Sharmin or whether the newspaper was a family venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing staff concerns that they were launching the paper without sufficient technical support or expertise, Ramrachisingh told M&amp;G that The Asian already had 17 permanent staff and all the necessary electronic production equipment to produce their first edition on April 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff and other sources, however, insist that there are only three to four permanent staff at the moment, including an editor and one layout artist.  Sources add that although R150 000 worth of computers had been promised, none had yet been delivered and an office had yet to be established for the newspaper's editorial section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, why is everyone getting so excited about this newspaper? The staff I've hired to date are perhaps not known to the industry, because I have deliberately not employed people already working on other newspapers - we want fresh, new staff,&quot; Ramrachisingh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial offices would be opened on Monday, he said, and the paper's first edition would go to print by April 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the telephonic interview, Ramrachisingh told M&amp;G that &quot;this had better not be a controversial story or you will be in trouble. I don't want any controversial stories and don't want to see my name there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh refused to say whether his attitude was a reflection of the proposed newspaper's editorial policy. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga premier, Mathews Phosa, lashed out at National Party (NP) politicians in the provincial legislature on Wednesday, accusing them of attempting to &quot;seduce me into political immaturity and conflict&quot; after they criticised his admin-istration's record over the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning that if they continued to use &quot;vicious and unfounded half-truths&quot; to &quot;trick&quot; him into reacting, Phosa threatened to allow the ANC to expose the previous performance of NP members of the provincial legislature while they were office bearers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm warning you, unless we tango together, I will use fire to extinguish fire. I will not be seduced into betraying President Mandela's programmes of reconciliation and nation-building,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa was reacting to NP provincial whip, Chris MacPherson, who earlier criticised his 1997 policy speech by saying &quot;never before has anyone said so much which meant so little&quot;. Quoting from various of Phosa's speeches where the premier speaks strongly against corruption, MacPherson asked why none of the high profile officials and politicians who had defrauded the provincial government over the past two years had yet been prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the recent decision of the Mpumalanga Development Corporation (MDC) to abandon disciplinary action against its former CEO, Patrick Mogorosi, as an example, MacPherson said that the government was sending a clear message to citizens that it was either unable or unwilling to control corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The independent investigation into Mogorosi, which proved beyond a doubt that he was responsible for maladministration, cost the State at least R780 000 and now instead of prosecuting, the province allows him to resign and actually rewards him by giving him a package,&quot; said MacPherson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three previous CEOs, against who no charges or allegations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were ever brought, were simply dismissed without any form of compensation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacPherson also questioned why the provincial government had ignored central government directives and the Steyn Commission on the Remuneration of Traditional Leaders by paying members of the House of Traditional Leaders higher salaries than any other region in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP also asked why the government was confusing investors and delaying the construction of the province's first international airport by giving support to two different and completing foreign schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite accusing MacPherson of gutter politics immediately after the allegations and of the warnings of severe ANC reaction on Wednesday, Phosa did not address the issues raised by MacPherson. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also refuted another senior staff member, identified only as &quot;small Rahj&quot; , who initially confirmed a link between the paper and Dolphin. The moment &quot; small Rahj&quot; confirmed the link, he was abruptly interrupted and told to transfer M&amp;G's call to &quot;big Rahj&quot; Ramrachisingh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If he told you that we were connected to Dolphin, then he was mistaken.  Look, I do know Dolphin Group president Ketan Somaia very well - he is a very very close friend - but there is no financial relationship between us on this project,&quot; insisted Ramrachisingh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to say whether he was Somaia's business partner in any other ventures or why both his and Somaia's media plans in KwaZulu Natal were so similar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia told M&amp;G two weeks ago that Dolphin intended launching a local edition of it's Indian focus daily newspaper, Asian Age, in South Africa within two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining that Asian Age already had international daily sales of 340 000 copies in Britain, the Middle East and India, Somaia said that the South African edition would at first only be a weekly and would be distributed nationwide after being printed in Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia described the paper as a &quot;hard-hitting, hard news publication&quot; which aimed at creating a voice for Indian communities in the countries it served, while also providing these communities with news from &quot;back home&quot; in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh described the The Asian as a &quot;hard-hitting tabloid with lots of investigative news designed for the Indian communities in South Africa&quot;.  His paper would also, he said, carry significant news from India but would focus primarily on southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Dolphin, The Asian will also print in Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town on a weekly basis at first, but would move towards becoming a daily as the market allowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Dolphin and Ramrachisingh also plan to launch Indian market niche magazines within six months of launching their newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin's magazine is intended to be a South African version of their Cineblitz Indian movie magazine, described by Somaia as an &quot;incredibly popular 'Bollywood' glossy&quot;, concentrating on India's massive movie industry and the hundreds of stars and films it produces every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cineblitz, he said, has monthly sales of roughly 300 000 copies in India.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SA edition would include looks at local independent films and Somaia didn't dismiss the possibility of bringing India movies to South Africa via Dolphin's movie distribution subsidiaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the launch and distribution strategies for Ramrachisingh's magazine are strikingly similar to Cineblitz's, its target market and name, Asian Business, are completely different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, we're just very good friends and we don't know each other's business plans. If there is any similarity, then it is just a coincidence and that's all,&quot; Ramrachisingh insisted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia was consistently unavailable for comment this week and Dolphin officials in South Africa said they had not yet been briefed on any publishing ventures, as these projects were run directly from Dubai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh repeatedly stressed that the The Asian was being launched with &quot;clean&quot; South African money and management, but refused to say how much had been committed to the venture or who the investors were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also at first refused to say whether he was a South Africa citizen or not, despite his marked Francophone accent. Ramrachisingh later conceded that he was a Mauritius based import/ export businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolphin has significant interests in Mauritius, including a banking group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The owner of Asian News (Pty) Ltd is Sharmin Ramrachisingh, a South African lawyer. There are other investors but they are all also South African, &quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh refused to comment on whether he was directly related to Sharmin or whether the newspaper was a family venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing staff concerns that they were launching the paper without sufficient technical support or expertise, Ramrachisingh told M&amp;G that The Asian already had 17 permanent staff and all the necessary electronic production equipment to produce their first edition on April 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff and other sources, however, insist that there are only three to four permanent staff at the moment, including an editor and one layout artist.  Sources add that although R150 000 worth of computers had been promised, none had yet been delivered and an office had yet to be established for the newspaper's editorial section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, why is everyone getting so excited about this newspaper? The staff I've hired to date are perhaps not known to the industry, because I have deliberately not employed people already working on other newspapers - we want fresh, new staff,&quot; Ramrachisingh said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The editorial offices would be opened on Monday, he said, and the paper's first edition would go to print by April 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the telephonic interview, Ramrachisingh told M&amp;G that &quot;this had better not be a controversial story or you will be in trouble. I don't want any controversial stories and don't want to see my name there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramrachisingh refused to say whether his attitude was a reflection of the proposed newspaper's editorial policy. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's investment drive is set to get a major boost in July when one of America's most influential clergymen, Reverend Leon Howard Sullivan, brings over a 1,000-strong broad-based delegation for an African African American summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day summit seeks to create consistency within the United States in assisting African countries with various forms of aid.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be the fourth summit held in Africa following three others in Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon and Senegal in 1991, 1993 and 1995 respectively, and makes Zimbabwe the first Anglophone country to host such a summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sullivan told journalists after a meeting with president Robert Mugabe on Wednesday that this year's summit was bound to be the best so far, describing it as the largest event since the Slave Trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect thousands of African Americans from business people, doctors, politicians, educationists and other contingents from the Caribbean and Europe,&quot; said Sullivan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the summit will be held in Zimbabwe, all southern African countries were expected to benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not only Zimbabwe which is to benefit, but we are also targeting other smaller countries that have been shut off before...we will also deal with democracy, (and) peace and hope to have up to 25 African leaders,&quot; Sullivan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African African American summit has renowned politicians and human rights activists such as Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young and wife of the late Martin Luther King, Correta King, as permanent delegates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - African countries were urged here Wednesday to continue with their economic and financial reforms in order to attain economic integration among themselves as well as into the world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were also called upon to seek solutions to their estimated 340 billion dollars debt in collaboration with the international community and the multilateral institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are contained in two resolutions adopted at the end of the three-day conference of the African ministers of finance, hosted by the UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) based in Addis Ababa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was also attended by some African central bank governors and top-level management of the world's leading financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution on &quot;Growth and Development Finance in Africa and Financial Sector Reforms&quot; urged African countries to adopt internationally accepted practices &quot;with regard to management, prudential supervision and regulation of their banks and non-bank financial institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They should also implement appropriate measures to gradually reduce their heavy dependence on external financing, &quot;and to improve mobilisation of domestic savings and non-debt creating flows, and to explore the potentials for privatisation as a way of promoting the development of capital markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution welcomed the steps taken by a number of African countries &quot; to improve the efficiency and transparency in the management of their money and capital markets and create new ones where they do not exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution on &quot;The Debt Problem and its Impact on Africa's Development Process&quot; urged the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral institutions to exercise more flexibility in conditions for debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is in particular with respect &quot;to the stringency of the ratio of total debt in net present value terms to exports and the need for a longer period of seven years or more to average out export earnings in eligibility conditions for access to the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative in order to allow as many reforming African countries as possible access to the facility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resolution also appeals to the multilateral financial institutions and the international community to continue supporting African countries with concessional financing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such funds should include grants necessary for them to accelerate the pace of economic and social development and rehabilitate their social sectors, especially education and health, as well as improve their infrastructures.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - Mauritius could serve as a model in conflict management in Africa because of its long history of stability, peace and harmony despite its multi-racial, multi-ethnic and multi-cultural setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This suggestion is contained in a document circulated here at the ongoing Regional Consultation on Higher Education in Africa, organised by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Education (UNESCO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In that paper, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mauritius, Prof.  Goolam Mohamedbhai, said his island nation's example and that of the Caribbean region deserved scrutiny to see whether the underlying causes of stability &quot;can be transposed to areas with similar set-up but which are conflict ridden.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his paper, on &quot;the role of higher education in developing a culture of peace in Africa &quot;,Mohamedbhai deplored the fact that all African regions are rocked by either economic, social, environment or political and religious crises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The result is that Africa alone accounted for 6 million of the world's 13 million refugees in 1996,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;more than any other continent in the world, establishing a culture of peace has become a priority for Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He challenged African universities and other educational institutions to play &quot;a meaningful role in developing a culture of peace, and redressing the present situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In so doing, Mohamedbhai, said, &quot;they can assist politicians/community leaders and international organisations such as the United Nations system in achieving the same goal.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the importance of training teachers &quot;to inculcate the values and attitudes that foster tolerance, create respect for cultural, ethnic and religious diversity as well as human rights and encourage peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The academician called for the introduction of peace-related modules in all university courses, including those in science and engineering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended several African universities which had already introduced peace studies, forced migration, refugee and humanitarian studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamedbhai called for a students' exchange programme among the continent's different geographical zones to make them &quot;understand the interdependence of countries in the region from a political, social, cultural and ecological standpoint.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He stressed the need to give priority to the enrolment of women on university courses because &quot;the mother is the primary agent for inculcating in the child the values and attitudes that foster tolerance, understanding and respect for others.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - A Zimbabwean consultant paediatrician, Rose Kambarami, said on Wednesday here that only five percent of all babies born in the country are at risk of acquiring HIV through breastfeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on &quot;HIV and breastfeeding&quot; at a Harare general hospital breastfeeding commemoration week, Kambarami said about 120,000 babies out of the the 400,000 babies delivered every year in Zimbabwe were at risk of contracting the deadly HIV, while 30 percent of the mothers were HIV positive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just because a mother is carrying HIV does not mean that the baby will definitely get the virus. There is a 50-50 (percent) chance that the baby will contract the virus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only 60,000 out of the 400,000 babies born every year will eventually get the infection,&quot; said Kambarami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said a third of the 60,000 mothers would infect their babies during delivery, while another third infected them during pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambarami said another third of the women would transmit HIV to their babies through breastfeeding, adding that there was much less chance of transmission if mothers exclusively breastfed their babies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some 20,000 infants will be infected with HIV through breast milk given the worst scenario. But what does that mean for the baby friendly hospital initiative? Only five percent of all babies born are at risk of acquiring HIV through breastfeeding,&quot; said Kambarami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said Zimbabwe could not abandon the whole initiative of baby friendly clinics because of the five percent given the enormous benefits of breastfeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The baby friendly hospital initiative and breast feeding has got to go ahead,&quot; she emphasised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Breast milk provides all the nutrition for a good healthy start to life.  It contains antibodies to build resistance and fight infections during the first few months of a new, fragile life. Breastfeeding also increases bonding between mother and baby,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Answering a question from some mothers, Kambarami said normally hiv babies did not survive beyond eight years although many had health problems in their first year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambarami said breast milk has always had germs and other viruses such as flu, hepatitis b, typhoid and tubercolosis (TB) and that there should not be any more serious worries about HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many other things that prevent the HIV infection getting to the baby such as other agents such as haemoglobin, anti-viral agents and anti- ferrons within the breast milk,&quot; said Kambarami.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambarami said if women did not exclusively breastfeed the baby, there was greater risk of infection by HIV through bottle feeding, which she said caused damage to the lining of the intestines resulting in bleeding and need to give the baby iron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you go on to give the baby formula, there is even greater risk. We have no data at the moment which says exclusive breastfeeding gives risk to HIV.  Unfortunately most mothers today do not like to breastfeed exclusively, which sort of damages the intestines and raises the risk of hiv of the child,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kambarami said Zimbabwe should advocate and channel all its efforts towards exclusive breastfeeding at least for the first six months, even if the child has HIV.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We should be trying to prevent a woman from getting infected in the first instance. More energies should be spent on the prevention rather than on finding remedies,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what has become the norm for the past two months, the heavy weights, led by financial counters, Barclays and Zimbabwe Financial Holdings (FINHOLD), were again lower forcing the key industrial to lose a further 36 points to end the day pegged at 10,070.62 points.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The index has so far lost 99 points since the beginning of the week following Tuesday's drop of nearly 63 points.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trend continued in minings where, although trading was relatively active, the index lost nearly 18 points to close at 969.89 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strong performance was mainly confined in gold counters, Falgold, up 5 cents at 70, and Ashanti which put on 100 cents to 9 500.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GABORONE, Botswana (PANA) - Botswana has experienced a surging imports growth at a rate of between 23.9 percent and 7.8 percent in the last 15 years, according to external trade statistics, to be released this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government central statistics office said imports have been growing sharply at an annual rate of 16.5 percent between 1980 and 1995, with the greatest growth recorded between 1983 and 1990 when imports grew at an annual rate of 23.9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It further states that imports shot-up by 20.4 percent in 1995. The increase is attributed to the continuation of the government large projects, like the north-south water carrier and the trans Kalahari road, linking Botswana and the Namibian sea-ports.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major imports included food, beverages and tobacco, fuel, chemical rubber products, wood and wood products. Others were textiles and footwear, metal and metal product, machinery and electrical equipment, vehicles and transport equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over years, Botswana's imports have been dominated by machinery and electrical goods. These accounted for an average of 18.0 percent between 1985 and 1995 and ranged from 15.7 percent to 23.1 percent. Imports of machinery and electrical goods grew at an annual rate of 16.1 percent between 1985 and 1995, from P 186 million to P 832 million,&quot; the report says. (2.7 pula = one U.S.dollar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds that almost all Botswana's imports originate from the Southern African Customs Union, mostly South Africa. &quot;From 1985 to 1988, South Africa was the major source of Botswana's imports, with a share ranging from 70 and 80 percent. This share rose to between 80 and 85 percent between 1989 and 1993.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the heavy trade dependence on South Africa is said to have dropped from 77.8 percent in 1994 to 73.7 in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, which is one of the Botswana's sources of imports, has lost the share value which has been hovering between 4.6 and 7.5 percent. And it has slummed down at an annual rate of 5.2 percent between 1990 and 1995.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Induced abortions have become a threat in Tanzania, a Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences researcher, Edmund Kayombo, has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a study conducted in Dar es Salaam recently, he said that despite existing laws, which make abortion illegal, 69 percent of single women aged between 14 and 39 have had an induced abortion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study also shows that 43 percent of gainfully employed women also go for abortion, while 17 percent of house wives have had an induced abortion at the Muhimbili Medical Centre, the country's largest referral hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records for the past three years at the centre showed that 10 percent of all the admission cases at the centre were abortion related.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On reasons for induced abortions, the survey shows that at least 43 percent aborted because they had undesired first pregnancies. Others do it in order to save their marriages from collapse, when the pregnancy originates outside the wedlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another study conducted in the southern-highland regions of Mbeya and Iringa, it was found that 21 percent of the 95 maternal deaths recorded were caused by induced abortions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A new satellite police charge office that opened with the aim of curbing crime in Cape Town's rowdy nightclub zone has closed after only a month because the club and bar owners who sponsored it have withdrawn their support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owners blame unco-operative colleagues for not sharing the costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nighclub and bar bosses around Waterkant, Bree and Riebeeck streets, where a concentration of nightspots attract thousands of people, pressed for the satellite police station in the neighbourhood, which has become notorious for muggings and unruly patrons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been shootings between rival nightclub bouncers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several businesspeople were to club together to meet the rent of a Waterkant Street shop to house the police station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as support from the once-enthusiastic businesses dwindled, the rent remained unpaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rent arrears prompted the landlord to put pressure on central Cape Town police commissioner Raymond Dowd, who investigated and found that club owners felt they were unfairly subsidising those who benefited without paying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some club and bar owners told the Cape Argus the satellite police office had not reduced crime, and that they had madetheir own security arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Dowd was asked to meet the rent arrears but decided instead to vacate the shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said his foot patrols would remain in the area &quot;like always&quot;, but added that there was no money in police coffers to pay the rent for the shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a good gesture by the business community to show their commitment to fight crime, but at the end of the day I was asked to pay the rent,&quot; he said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pub owner Barry Gilinsky, who spearheaded the campaign to establish a satellite station, said many businessmen had bent over backwards to get it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Each business had to pay only R100 a month, but there were some who were not prepared to do even that after pledging their support at a public meeting, &quot; said Mr Gilinsky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would have been a step in the right direction to get rid of crime and give the streets back to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But now it's every business for itself, thanks to a few unco-operative people who did not want to recognise the long-term benefits of the business fraternity uniting against crime.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The birth of the new school curriculum has sounded the death knell of the old apartheid education system which shaped minds for more than 40 years. Education Reporter SABATA NGCAI takes a look at the curriculum to see what is new about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After months of hard work at the drawing board, South African stakeholders have come up with a product that will make its mark on education for the next century and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the new curriculum, school as pupils know it today will soon be out of fashion. For a start, pupils will be called &quot;learners&quot; and exams will be a thing of the past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the education ministry unveiled &quot;Curriculum 2005&quot; which aims to create &quot;thinking, competent future citizens&quot; via a &quot;lifelong system which is people-centred&quot;. It is a radical break with the education system most South Africans know which:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Featured passive learners;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Was exam driven;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Promoted rote learning;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Had a syllabus which was content-based and broken down into subjects;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Was textbook/worksheet-bound and teacher centred;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Had a rigid and non-negotiable syllabus;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Made teachers responsible for learning and motivation dependant on the personality of the teacher;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Emphasised what the teacher hoped to achieve;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Placed content into rigid time-frames; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Denied public comment on the curriculum development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the new curriculum intends to produce:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Active learners;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Critical thinking, reasoning, reflection and action;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An integration of knowledge; learning that is relevant and connected to real life situations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Learner-centred schooling where the teacher is a facilitator who constantly uses groupwork and teamwork to consolidate the new approach;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Learning programmes that are guides allowing teachers to be innovative and creative in designing programmes;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Learners who take responsibility for their learning and are motivated by constant feedback and affirmation of their worth;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Emphasis on outcomes - what the learner becomes and understands,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Flexible time-frames allowing learners to work at their own pace; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Encouragement of comment and input from the wider community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the new curriculum, pupils will no longer be expected to regurgitate what the teacher tells them, as was the case in the past. They will learn from one another by asking questions, debating and coming up with solutions and understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The introduction of the new curriculum will be done in phases, starting with grades 1 and 7 (Standard 5) next year. grades 2 and 8 (Standard 6) in 1999, grades 3 (Standard 1) and 9 (Standard 7) in 2001, grades 4 (Standard 2) and 10 (Standard 8) in 2000, grades 5 (Standard 3) and 11 (Standard 9) in 2002 and grades 6 (Standard 4) and 12 (Standard 10) in 2003.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 2004 and 2005 there will be fundamental reviews of the new curriculum with a view to improving and refining goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even terms used in education are to change; pupils and students will be called &quot;learners&quot;, teachers will be &quot;educators&quot; and subjects will be replaced by &quot;eight learning areas&quot;, each run by a committee of teachers, students, workers and specialists, as well as education officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The learning areas are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Communication, literacy and language learning: people interact with the world and one another through language and the new curriculum aims to improve communication and create a South Africa free of intolerance, misunderstanding and prejudice, the focus of this learning area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Numeracy and mathematics: maths encourages logical thinking and problem - solving and teaches people analytical skills that will allow them to make critical decisions. This is expected to equip the learners to cope with a rapidly changing technological environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Human and social sciences: South Africa needs responsible citizens who are able to operate in a culturally diverse, democratic society. People will learn how to interact with one another and with their environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Natural sciences: to manage the resources of the world effectively, people need to understand the universe. This learning area is intended to equip learners to understand natural resources and manage them effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Arts and culture: through developing creativity and exploring diverse cultures, spiritual, intellectual and emotional aspects will be promoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Economic and management sciences: this area develops all people into economically active citizens able to take part in the economic development of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Life orientation: to cope with the challenges of a changing society, learners need to develop life skills. Life orientation includes the building of self-esteem, survival skills and a healthy lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Technology: without access to technology learners will be unable to compete internationally. This learning area will promote all aspects of technology - planning, design and manufacturing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each learner is expected to demonstrate general skills, abilities and values, knowledge, attitudes and understanding that should be displayed in a particular context. These are called learning area outcomes and specific outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The learners' progress will be measured against these outcomes rather than against their performance. There will be no passing or failing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learners who do not meet the criteria for attaining a standard can apply for reassessment. Learners can decide when they are ready for assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers will assess learners continuously through strategies like peer- and self-assessment, initiating projects and assisting in putting together portfolios.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only at the end of grades 9 and 12 will there be comprehensive external assessment. Some external assessment will also be done at the end of grades 3 and 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcomes-based system enables the learners and teachers to determine whether or not learners are achieving the agreed outcomes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the curriculum &quot;a variety of assessment methods will be available to ensure the methods are suited to the performance being assessed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Methods will not disadvantage individuals or groups by hindering or limiting them in ways unrelated to the evidence sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Evidence collection for use in assessment will be ongoing, linked with the normal course of learning or working and not from one-off assessment occasions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The methods used will be straightforward, pre-arranged and will not interfere unduly with learning. Learners will understand the assessment process and the criteria to be applied and can contribute to the planning and accumulation of evidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the medium of instruction, a learner in a public school &quot;shall have the right to instruction in the language of his or her choice where this is reasonably practicable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governing body of a public school may determine the language policy of the school subject to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The national policy determined by the Education Minister in terms of the National Education Policy Act; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The provincial policy, provided that no form of racial discrimination is practised in exercising this policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schools shall provide for more than one language of teaching where there is a need.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The curriculum requires that:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All schools offer at least one approved language as a subject in Grade 1 and Grade 2;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All schools offer at least two approved languages, of which at least one shall be an official language, from Grade 3 onwards; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All language subjects must get equal time allocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pupils will be promoted to the next class according to the following requirements:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* In grades1 to 4, promotion is based on performance in one language and mathematics, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* From Grade 5 upwards, one language must be passed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial education departments will determine other levels of achievement required for promotion against the background of national norms and standards determined by the minister of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The classroom environment is also expected to change once the new curriculum is implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes are expected to enable learners:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To have greater self-esteem because they will be allowed to develop at their own pace;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To learn to value teamwork and how to take responsibility for their own learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Learners will become analytical and creative thinkers, problem solvers and effective communicators. They will know how to gather and organise information and conduct research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be more aware of their responsibilities to the environment and the people around them;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* To understand why they are learning. Constant feedback will keep them motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parents also have a role to play. They are required to share with the state the responsibility for the education of their children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are encouraged to further their own education and use any knowledge gained to build and develop their communities and country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first step is for parents to understand the new curriculum and get involved in the governing bodies of schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the teachers and trainers, the curriculum requires them to focus on the outcomes of education rather than &quot;merely teaching information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It encourages teachers and trainers to translate the learning programmes into something achievable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There will be a shift away from content-based programmes where teachers aim to cover the curriculum in a predetermined amount of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Teachers and trainers are encouraged to find ways of providing conditions of success in the classroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A positive learning environment is seen as essential to educator and learner-motivation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The curriculum requires teachers and trainers to become facilitators rather than &quot;transmitters of knowledge&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will use a variety of methods of instruction to help each learner to learn. Teachers are encouraged to broaden their perspectives, to be proactive, interactive and share their ideas with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They might even be able to teach jointly with others in some learning areas.  The teacher would probably teach the whole class for some sessions and place the learners in groups in other sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In-depth teacher training will be conducted for teachers in grades 1 and 7 during the course of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Facilitators are expected to be trained in each province and they will be responsible for conveying information to teachers.</SPAN></P>

It is a history of the Black River area of Rondebosch, which lay across Rondebosch Common, from Klipfontein Road to Park Road Estate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well over a thousand coloured and Indian residents were moved from there in the late 1960s as a result of a Group Areas proclamation, and some made way for the Kromboom freeway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Durban, Uma, who has a PhD from the University of Natal, moved to Cape Town when her husband landed a lectureship in linguistics at the University of Cape Town. She was later appointed as a researcher in UCT's Department of Sociology's Group Areas project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archival material she found as she delved into the historical side of Group Areas formed the basis of her book but it was her personal experience that drove her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We wanted to live in Rondebosch to be near UCT, but the estate agents couldn't break the law and we had to rent a one-room holiday apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I spent my first year in Cape Town being very angry about the Group Areas Act. Being forced, as Indians, to move to sandy, arid Rylands added to my anger. I clearly see myself as a victim of Group Areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now her garden is growing, she's unearthing the area's rich history and the Minister of Justice, Dullah Omar, is just three streets away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was also a victim of Group Areas and he's chosen to remain in the community and the community admires him for that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other victims of forced removals are nearby.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm five minutes from Manenberg, Hanover Park, Athlone and next door to Crawford. We're well positioned, so I'm happy to be here in the end.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, needing to present a paper at a conference, she found a small file on the forced removals of Fraserdale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was a little paper that changed my focus, and became the basis of the book I am now researching.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraserdale was the Black River area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the file were records, written by Group Area Board officials, listing 270 families in the area, people who were simply statistics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to tell the story of Black River, you have to look for the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uma found the man who had been the secretary of the Black River Ratepayers' Association, a group of coloured and Indian people who tried to prevent the area from being declared. They wanted it left as it was, while some whites asked that it be declared white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through this man, Abou Desai, and his precious collection of private papers, Uma found and interviewed 40 people who had been part of that close-knit Black River community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were teachers, domestic workers who felt themselves part of the white families they worked for, artisans, hawkers, manual labourers, home-owners and tenants living in sturdy homes and derelict houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many said they knew they lived in Rondebosch, but they preferred to see themselves as Black River people. It meant more to them than being a citizen of Rondebosch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When that area was proclaimed in 1966 there was a 100-year-old church at the bottom of Park Road Estate and Strathallen Road. A modest church with a congregation of 200, with a school attached to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;St James was a school with poor facilities - one big hall, curtained off for classrooms. Many of the residents had been to St James, so the school and church played a very important role in binding the community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The church building and the school were eventually demolished to make way for the Kromboom freeway, though neither was used once the community had moved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Families tell me to stand in that part of Rondebosch and to look at the Kromboom Parkway and in the middle of the traffic island is a palm tree.  Below that palm tree used to be the home of a Black River resident who said to me, 'Thank God they didn't destroy the palm tree'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty years on, the Black River people put their treasured mementoes into Uma's hands. A shopkeeper's receipt shows the loaves of bread he took for his last day; a glass bottle from the shop used to hold sweets for sticky, star- fish fingers; in pride of place in a sitting room is a framed photograph of another resident's father's shop on the old Klipfontein Road; Pirates Cricket Club members proudly produced a valued badge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've also collected about 120 photographs, one from a white woman of herself walking on Rondebosch Common, another from a Black River resident walking her dog on the Common, and another shows the Black River cricket team sitting on the Common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These three photographs tell me that Rondebosch Common was for everybody.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the Black River community are now claiming compensation through the Land Claims Commission, even those who are now settled and getting on with their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's an amazing resilience of the human spirit,&quot; Uma says. &quot;A woman who's now a psychiatrist is the daughter of a Black River woman who was a domestic worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When one talks about Group Areas in Cape Town, the major focus is on District Six. But all over Cape Town were little communities and I'm sure they ask themselves why nobody remembers them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Black River community is small and unpretentious, it's not about famous people, it's a story about ordinary people and I think it needs to be told.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The pitiful state of the SA Navy is graphically illustrated by the armada of modern warships currently in Simon's town for the navy's 75th anniversary celebrations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of warships from a dozen foreign nations for the SA Navy's 75th anniversary celebrations this week has once again highlighted the depths to which our once proud maritime service has sunk. When it comes to equipment, that is.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the world's great maritime powers such as the United States, Britain, France and Russia will be represented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the southern hemisphere, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay are among those who will take part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All these nations have provided modern frigates or corvettes for the international fleet review in Table Bay on April 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, by contrast, can muster only its ageing strike craft and a variety of service vessels. President Mandela, foreign navy chiefs and other dignitaries will view the flotilla of ships from SAS Protea, a hydrographic survey vessel. Quite clearly, South Africa will be Cinderella at its own ball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Navy needs new equipment urgently and it is not merely a matter of appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This country has a vast coastline to patrol, harbours and priceless resources to protect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the navy remains in its present moribund state, foreign nations are free to plunder our fishing resources with impunity, ships transporting cargo such as dangerous nuclear waste can defy international territorial limits and we are pressed beyond limits to fulfil our international obligations in respect of sea rescues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 75 years of proud tradition behind it, the SA Navy is the logical service to undertake all these duties. But it must get modern equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If not, this week's celebrations could well translate into a wake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Unit trust investors will be paying more for their investment from this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since yesterday, the cost of buying unit trusts has risen following the Government's decision to impose Value Added Tax (VAT) on initial charges levied by unit trust management companies, bringing the amount to a maximum of 5,462 percent from 5 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VAT will be imposed on two thirds of the initial charge levied.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Association of Unit Trusts executive director Colin Woodin told the Cape Argus that the increase in initial charges would not affect investors severely because the marketable securities tax on share transactions had also been reduced at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effect of the imposition of VAT on investors was smaller than the cuts in marketable securities tax, which had been reduced from 1,5 percent to 0,25 percent over the past few years, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The marketable securities tax is the amount investors pay when they purchase shares, and the initial charge &quot;is that part of the selling price that the investor pays for his units which covers the costs to the management company of marketing the trust,&quot; Mr Woodin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is going to cost the investor that little bit more to buy units,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Woodin said the investor who spent R100 a month on unit trusts would now pay R5,46 to cover the management company's marketing costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investors who made big investments could negotiate lower rates, Mr Woodin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He explained that the calculation of VAT on initial charges was the result of long negotiations between the Association of Unit Trusts and the revenue authorities and recognised the work done by the unit trust management companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government is insisting that VAT is applied to anything where work is done or value added to something,&quot; Mr Woodin said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Despite the repeated promises of the Chadian government, 1996 and the first months of this year have been marked by an increase in human rights violations, Amnesty International said today in its new report entitled, Chad: Hope betrayed, made public following the recommendation of the working group of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to keep the examination of the human rights situation in Chad in the confidential procedure for another year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its report, the organization points out the institutionalization of the practice of extrajudicial executions. In November 1996, a written instruction by the Commander of the Specialized Units of the gendarmerie ordered the security forces to &quot;eliminate any suspected thief&quot;. This instruction received on several occasions the support of the state's highest authorities. Scores of people have been extrajudicially executed over the course of the last few months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only after the adoption of a resolution by the European Parliament condemning extrajudicial executions in Chad did the Chadian Prime Minister, Koibla Djimasta, announce on Radio France International(RFI), that the measure was no longer in force. However, despite this, the practice of these illegal acts has not stopped. Information received by Amnesty International confirms that extrajudicial executions are continuing, in secret, after dark.  At the beginning of March 1997 several bodies were found in the river Chari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For many years, hundreds of men and women, including Bichara Digui, a political opponent, have been killed and not one perpetrator of these violations has been brought to justice,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phenomenon of &quot;disappearances&quot; has continued. The organization has received no news of four people, including Ibrahim Souleymane, who &quot; disappeared&quot; in August 1996 after being handed over to the Chadian authorities by the Sudanese authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People continue to be held without trial, despite several protests by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations. Several people, including Job Mbanboungue, a Gendarmerie warrant officer, and Abel Djimon, a clerk in the public prosecutor's department, have been held without charge since November 1996; they are suspected of having distributed the written instruction of the Commander of the Gendarmerie to physically eliminate those accused of theft. Amnesty International considers these detainees to be prisoners of conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of people have been detained without charge or trial at Faya Largeau since 1995. During its April 1996 mission, Amnesty International again raised its concerns in relation to these arbitrary arrests followed by torture and ill-treatment. Despite the assurances of the Minister of Justice that he would investigate the circumstances of the arrests and that the detainees would be released if no charges were being brought against them, these people are still detained without charge or trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of human rights defenders, including members of the movement, Tchad Non Violence, Chad Non Violence and the Ligue tchadienne des droits de l'homme (LTDH), Chadian Human Rights League, continue to be harassed by the security forces. Some, including Abdallah Issa Idriss, president of the regional branch of the LTDH at Faya Largeau have received death threats, Lazare Tikri Serge, General Secretary of Tchad Non Violence was attacked by members of the Agence nationale de securite (ANS), National Security Agency.  He was accused by the ANS of being a spy after he refused to go with them to the Gendarmerie. In February in Moundou, Firmin Nengomnang, a member of the LTDH, was beaten with rifle butts and threatened with execution by members of Chadian security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International has received many new testimonies of routine recourse to torture and ill-treatment, including rape. This practice has increased since the order given to the security forces to kill suspected thieves. In Moundou, in Logone Occidental, at least three young women were raped by members of the security forces between September and December 1996. Three prisoners who escaped from prison at Faya Largeau told Amnesty International that during the first three months of their detention they were tied &quot;with chains and were not allowed outside&quot;. Several victims of extrajudicial execution bore signs of torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inhuman conditions of detention and ill-treatment after arrest are often the cause of death of detainees. In November 1996, Mahamat Ahmat Hanat was tortured to death at the Fourth District police station in N'Djamena. When the security forces realized that the prisoner had died of his injuries, they left him without explanation at the central hospital mortuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International also condemns human rights abuses committed by armed opposition groups. The Forces armees pour la Republique federale (FARF), Armed Forces for a Federal Republic, are accused of having tortured and killed several civilians, including two women, in the two Logone regions over the last six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October 1996, the organization published a document on Chad entitled, Chad: A country under the arbitrary rule of the security forces with the tacit consent of other countries, which criticized other governments, including those of China, France, Sudan and the USA, with regard to security and police transfers that have contributed to human rights violations in Chad.  In December, the French authorities informed Amnesty International in a letter that France had ceased to supply weapons and ammunition to the Chadian army years ago and that the human rights situation had considerably improved in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;French security equipment -- such as handcuffs, vehicles, telecommunications systems -- are constantly used in Chad and contributes to human rights violations,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New testimonies received by the organisation show prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, being forced to do work for the French military aid mission at Faya Largeau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization calls on the Chadian authorities to take all necessary steps to build a state of law and to release all prisoners of conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Commission for Human Rights at its next meeting in April should examine the human rights situation of Chad through the public procedure,&quot; Amnesty International said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The sixth session of the African Ministers of Finance came to an end here at the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) after three days of exhausting deliberations whose implications have the potential for bringing about a sea-change in the way Africa does business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial reforms and the debt overhang provided the framework for Ministers' debate. They were joined by the World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank (ADB) and leaders of capital markets and banks from around the world. Among them: Stanley Morgan, Lehman Brothers, the International Bank of Settlements (BIS) and the Nordic Investment Bank (NIB).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visible as in no other conference in the history of ECA, managers of emerging African stock exchanges brushed shoulders with governors of central African banks and academicians. The Conference adopted two resolutions and a declaration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resolution 1: Growth and development finance in Africa and financial sector reforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conference of African Ministers of Finance,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aware of the importance of the financial sector in Africa, its fragile nature in most African countries, and the need to enhance its role both in the mobilization of domestic and external resources,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognizing the importance of continuing with the implementation of and deepening financial sector reforms in many of our countries, the need for enhanced autonomy of central banks and the importance for coordination between monetary and fiscal policy,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting the important role capital markets are playing in other regions of the world in the mobilization of domestic and external resources needed to support the development process and in attracting foreign investment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conscious of the fact that a reformed, efficient and buoyant financial sector can substantially contribute to the development of a country and its integration into international financial markets,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aware of the importance of micro-financing to the alleviation of poverty in the region,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling resolution annex II on the &quot;Problematique of financing the development process in Africa&quot; adopted by the fifth session of the Conference of African Ministers of Finance in March 1994 in Libreville, Gabon which called upon African countries to intensify efforts to improve the institutional framework needed for effective intermediation in African countries and resolution 2(IV) on &quot;The role of indigenous banking and financial institutions in the mobilization of financial resources for development&quot; adopted by the fourth session of the Conference in December 1991 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having reviewed the state of development finance in Africa and noted the decline in traditional sources of foreign assistance to the continent and the need to find substitute sources of funding for their development process,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the dependency of the majority of African countries on external assistance and that official development assistance to African countries has in recent years either declined or stagnated in real terms,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Urges African countries to continue with their economic and financial reforms, with a view to achieving sustainable development for their economies and for their effective integration in the world economy and among themselves;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Calls upon African countries to implement appropriate measures to reduce gradually their heavy dependency on external financing and to improve mobilization of domestic savings and non-debt creating flows and to explore the potentials for privatization as a way of promoting the development of capital markets;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Urges African countries to adopt internationally accepted best practices with regard to management, prudential supervision and regulation of their banks and non-bank financial institutions;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Welcomes the steps taken by a number of African countries to improve the efficiency and transparency in the management of their money and capital markets and to create new ones where they do not exist;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Further calls upon African countries to intensify their efforts in deepening and broadening and strengthening the process of financial intermediation in their countries;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Encourages African countries to establish regional stock markets, particularly where individual countries lack the capacity to establish their own;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Appeals to the international community to step up significantly their financial support to African countries in the implementation of their economic and financial reforms ;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Urges the Economic Commission for Africa, the Organization of African Unity and the African Development Bank to continue to assist African countries, in collaboration with other agencies including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in their mobilization of domestic and external resources needed to support development, financial sector reforms and in the development of their money and capital markets;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resolution 2: The debt problem and its impact on Africa's development process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Conference of African Ministers of Finance,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerned that despite notable efforts made by African countries to reform their economies and the support of the international community, the debt problem continues to be a major constraint on the economic and social development of many African countries,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the amount of resources devoted by African countries to servicing their external debts which could be used for the development of their social sectors and improvement of their infrastructures,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aware of the impact of the debt overhang on the continent's capabilities to attract non-debt creating flows, and in particular foreign direct investment,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Noting that official development assistance to African countries has either declined or stagnated in real terms,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recalling resolution I(IV) on the &quot;African debt problem&quot; adopted by the fourth session of the Conference of African Ministers of Finance in December 1991 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and resolution annex I on the &quot;Treatment of the debt of African countries&quot; adopted by the fifth session of the Conference in March 1994 in Libreville, Gabon as well as the declaration on &quot;Africa's external debt&quot; adopted by the ECA Conference of Ministers in May 1995 all of which urged African countries and their development partners to find a lasting solution to the problem within the framework of promoting sustainable development in Africa,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further recalling the various resolutions of African Heads of State and Government and the United Nations General Assembly on the same issue,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appreciative of the efforts of the multilateral institutions and the international community to assist in finding a lasting solution to this problem as partially reflected in the Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) launched in 1996 by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering that a lasting solution to the African debt problem can be achieved in the context of a broad framework of budgetary discipline and prudence, proper recording and development of debt management capacity, donor assistance and resetting national priorities and for providing significant resources to these countries which will assist them to achieve sustainable growth and development and thereby enable them to move out of the debt and poverty trap,</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Commit ourselves to continue with economic and financial reforms, enhance our debt and macroeconomic management capacities and the exchange of information on debt management, in order to contribute to the achievement of debt sustainability in our countries;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Urges the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the African Development Bank and other multilateral institutions to exercise more flexibility in particular with respect to the stringency of the ratio of total debt in net present value terms to exports in eligibility conditions for access to the HIPC Initiative in order to allow as many reforming African countries as possible access to the facility;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Stresses the importance of advancing the completion point for countries with a demonstrated record of a strong performance record over a prolonger period;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Appeals to the non-Paris Club bilateral creditors to take effective measures to reduce the stock of debt of African countries owed to them;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Further appeals to the multilateral financial institutions and international community to continue to support African countries with concessional financing including grants necessary for them to accelerate the pace of economic and social development and rehabilitate their social sectors, especially education and health, and improve their infrastructures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA DECLARATION OF THE AFRICAN MINISTERS OF FINANCE ON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT FINANCE IN AFRICA AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS AND THE AFRICAN DEBT PROBLEM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We, the African Ministers of Finance gathered at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from 31 March to 2 April 1997, for the sixth session of the Conference of African Ministers of Finance, have reviewed the state of development finance, financial sector reforms and the African debt problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within this context, we have undertaken a constructive dialogue with our development partners on a number of developmental issues of importance to our continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, we have reaffirmed our commitment to economic and financial sector reforms, and in collaboration with our development partners, to finding a lasting solution to the African debt problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important issues discussed included the role of multilateral financial institutions and bilateral creditors in Africa's development; financial sector reforms and the development of capital markets, within the framework of mobilization of resources needed to support Africa's development; and the continuing debt problems of African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We acknowledge that in view of the weakening of traditional sources of development support and mechanisms for channelling financial aid, the conspicuous challenge that will face many of our countries will be finding substitute financing needed to spur growth and to reduce poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are aware that the challenging task of mobilizing domestic resources and attracting foreign investment will have to be intensified for gross domestic savings rates to be raised to higher levels needed to support a higher level of investment and growth. The need for reforming our financial sectors and developing viable money and capital markets has therefore to be perceived in the context of both raising domestic savings ratios and attracting foreign investment. Accordingly, the deepening and broadening of Africa's financial sector and development of efficiently functioning capital markets will need to be a major priority as Africa moves to the twenty-first century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We acknowledge the role multilateral financial institutions have played in assisting Africa to mobilize resources required to support development and in undertaking economic and financial reforms. We urge them to continue to provide a greater proportion of the concessional finance and grants needed to support our infrastructural development and delivery of social services. We also call on them to assist Africa to build the appropriate capacities required for the continent to be able to attract non-debt creating resource flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have also reviewed the African debt situation and noted with concern that despite notable efforts by African countries and the international community to reduce the burden of debt service for African countries, the stock of debt (in net present value terms) to exports ratio continues to increase. The stock of debt is estimated at US$340.5 billion at the end of 1996 and total debt service payments amounted to US$24.0 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is in this context, that African countries have welcomed the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) Initiative launched by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in September 1996; more also that the Initiative for the first time has provided for relief on multilateral debt. This Initiative is a partial reflection of the commitment of the international community to finding a lasting solution to the African debt problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the eligibility conditions and debt sustainability analysis for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) should be more flexible.  The HIPC has targeted only 41 countries of which 33 are in Africa and is possible that about half may benefit from the facility. With only 9 African countries from which data is available classified by the World Bank as relatively free of external debt problems and 32 classified as &quot;severely debt distressed&quot;, the African debt problem will continue to stifle Africa's development and poverty eradication efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We continue to be concerned that the magnitudes of the debt are obviously unsustainable. African countries continue to devote a large proportion of their resources to servicing their external debts, when their social sectors and infrastructures are in dire need of rehabilitation and reconstruction. We call on our development partners to assist the region in finding practical and lasting solutions to the twin debt and poverty problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We acknowledge that in the medium to long term, Africa's development will need to be enhanced by intensifying domestic savings mobilization and local investments efforts complemented by non-debt creating flows, including foreign investment. It is in this respect, that many of our countries have put significant efforts to attract foreign investment, including comprehensive revisions of our investment codes. Liberalized macro economic policies and political reforms currently being implemented are also intended to provide the necessary environment conducive to both local and foreign investment. We commit ourselves to continuing with these reforms and call on the donor community to support our efforts to attract foreign investment as well as opening up their markets to Africa's exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The challenges of globalization and liberalization of the world economy as well as financial markets dictate that our countries adapt rapidly to these developments if our continent is to become an effective partner in the international economy. We are committed to the process of ensuring that Africa moves in that direction and call on the international community to supplement our efforts with significant resources and appropriate support.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The military administration in Lagos has set up 29 tribunals to enforce government-approved rents as part of an effort to protect embattled tenants from greedy landlords in this city, Nigeria's economic hub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos state Military Administrator Mohammed Marwa administered the oath of office on the tribunal chairmen on Wednesday, after unveiling the Rent Control and Recovery of Premises Edict 1997. It came into effect March 21.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the edict as &quot;citizen-friendly,&quot; with provisions that could improve the often strained tenant-landlord relationship. He said it would also improve the demand/supply situation of housing delivery in this city of some six million people with acute accommodation problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marwa said the law was not targeted at landlords or the tenants but would benefit everyone. If everyone cooperated, he added, the tribunals would not have cause to apply the sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penalties range from a fine of 20,000 naira to two years in jail for offenders (85 naira = 1 U.S. dollar).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the law, it is illegal for a landlord or his agent to demand or receive advance rent in excess of six months from an in-coming tenant, in respect of a one-room and a room and parlour apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A maximum one-year advance rent is stipulated for all other categories of apartment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now, there was no ceiling on advance rent. The result was that some Lagos landlords demand up to five years' advance payment from new tenants.  Cases of unlawful eviction of tenants were also rampant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new edict prescribes a 20,000-naira fine or three years in prison for any landlord found guilty of using &quot;tactics of demolishing or modifying a building with a view to ejecting a tenant.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A landlord who presents a &quot;fake tenant&quot; to obtain a court judgment for the ejection of a bona fide tenant can, on conviction, be jailed for two years.  The law is silent on any option of fine for this offence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A landlord who declines rent from a tenant for no justifiable reason would be made to receive the money through the rent tribunal but less a 10-percent penalty surcharge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The law, which categorizes buildings in Lagos into zones and different rates, applies to accommodation with a yearly rental value not exceeding 250, 000 naira as at 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fixed rents range between 55 and 60 naira a room in rural areas to 650 naira in metro Lagos. The rents for a three-room apartment range from 1,500 to 10,600 naira a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although many Lagos tenants have welcomed the government move, they warn that implementation could be a problem. They cite previous failed official attempts to peg rents in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the problem with rent edicts in the past was that some desperate tenants even connived with landlords to pay amounts higher than what the law stipulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While, the Marwa administration has given an assurance that this would not be the case now, observers say a lasting solution to the perennial accommodation crisis in Lagos would be a deliberate policy, involving both the government and the private sector to make housing more available and at affordable prices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabweans have joined the continent's academics, jurists and human rights activists in advocating changes in the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, which they say is fraught with contradictions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They note that it is vague and serves the interests of political leaders rather than protect the ordinary citizen for whom it was drafted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The heads of state had no other human but themselves in mind when they drafted the charter,&quot; said Nicholas Ngwabi, a local activist, at a recent human rights workshop in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter, which was analyzed by activists at the workshop, contains provisions which accord certain fundamental rights to individuals and societies to be adhered to by the 41 OAU member states which have ratified it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The document has never been used and looking at it, its easy to see that it is inaccessible to the ordinary man,&quot; said Cousin Zilala, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association education officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He points out the case of Nigerian writer and Ogoni activist ken Saro-Wiwa and nine others who were executed by the military regime in 1995 for their activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 7 of the charter states that &quot;every individual shall have a right to have his cause heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a general feeling that Saro-Wiwa's case was not adequately attended to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zilala said the charter's major weakness is that it contains provisions for compiling reports to a commission made up of 11 members who are appointed by heads of state and endorsed by the entire OAU summit to implement and monitor the charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The members are of the highest reputation, morality, competence, integrity and impartiality,&quot; says the charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, critics say because the commission is appointed by heads of state it owes its allegiance to the leadership. They also argue that the requirement that complainants indicate their names, age, profession and address makes them vulnerable to intimidation when the commission's chairman consults the state concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter places restriction on continental arbitration in that domestic remedies have to be exhausted before cases of human rights violations are brought before the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commission can only deal with a matter submitted to it after making sure that all local remedies, if they exist, have been exhausted unless it is obvious to the commission that the procedure of achieving these remedies would be unduly prolonged,&quot; says the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues of complaint should also not be those already dealt with by member states, leaving no room for those who feel unjustly treated to seek audience with a higher court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before each session, the secretary of the commission compiles a list of complaints and transmits them to members of the commission who select the cases to be dealt with. A complaint is only considered if a majority of the commission's members so decide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is no clear criteria for the selection process on the cases that are considered, the reports should be compatible with the charter, and information should be sourced from personal knowledge not the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter has no provision for enforcement of the commission's adjudication and plans of an African court have proved not feasible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts say while there is room for states to submit complaints of human rights violations by other states, the mechanism has never been utilized because of the commission's strong links and loyalty to heads of states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It seems at the outset to contain absolute rights but then towards the end places limitations and circumstances for derogation,&quot; Zilala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While article 9 accords individuals the freedom to receive information, express and disseminate their opinions, this should be done &quot;within the law&quot; of the respective country. Article 10 allows freedom of association, but with a proviso that this should be in accordance with the country's law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charter gives all people a right to existence and self-determination although it has failed to protect the cause of minority groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zilala said some people have tried to use it as a charter on human and people's rights, but the commission asked them to define what a &quot;people&quot; are, adding that the definition of people can be altered depending on the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They liken the charter to the seven commandments in George Orwell's novel, Animal Farm, which eventually justified wrongdoing by the leadership through provisional clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activists feel the charter, which was drafted in an attempt to uphold human rights within an African context, has failed to fulfill its purpose and it is a shallow echo to the United Nations declaration of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The African charter is a non-starter and is totally unrealistic and impractical,&quot; said Clemence Moyo, Zimrights Matabeleland regional chairman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) has urged its member-states to propose suitable solutions that will replace the financial assistance to be reviewed by the European Union (EU) by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizations acting secretary-general, Erastus Mwencha, said in Lusaka Thursday that it was quite clear from the European Union's green paper that the preferences which COMESA member-states have enjoyed will come to an end in the year 2000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the opening of the three-day COMESA inter-governmental committee meeting, he said the restructuring of the relationship between the Union and the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States was important and requires thorough deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In September 1998, the 15-member EU is expected to begin formal negotiations on the future relations with its 70 ACP states. Since 1975, the relationship between them has been governed by the Lome Convention which is to cease in year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwencha appealed to the meeting to also study the recommendations by COMESA governors of central banks on the introduction of the COMESA dollar as a new unit of account to replace the PTA (UAPTA) which was phased out in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting will be followed by the third COMESA council of ministers meetings which will culminate into the summit of heads of state and government scheduled for April 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the issues to be discussed at the summit are the notices of Lesotho and Mozambique to withdraw from the organisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - East African Postal Administrations would jointly introduce a Speed Cash Interstate Service, effective from this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public relations manager of Tanzania Posts Corporation, Wilfred Miigo, said the service would initially be operated in Dar es Salaam, Nairobi and Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miigo said the services would involve cash remittance of an amount not exceeding an equivalent of 300,000 Tanzania shillings (about 500 U.S. dollars) per single order.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that the customer could remit up to two orders per day amounting to 600,000 shillings (1,000 dollars) only using local currencies of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda in the transaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining the procedures, Miigo said a customer in one country would remit cash to another country by using his country's local currency. Payment will be made in local currency of the destination country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount to be paid would be based on the conversion rates issued daily by the respective central banks of each country on the payment day. Cash remitted between the capital cities of East Africa will be paid within 48 hours only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miigo said the Tanzania Posts Corporation finalized the formalities of introducing the service, which would initially commence at the Dar Es Salaam General Post Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the service would be extended to the department branch offices outside Dar Es Salaam and to regional posts offices after performance evaluation of the service to be undertaken in July 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miigo also said that the decision to introduce the speed cash interstate service at the three capitals of East Africa was made during the 6th tripartite meeting held in Nairobi, Kenya, March 4 to March 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the meeting was attended by all Chief Executives of the postal and telecommunications administrations of East Africa with the Tanzania team being led by Postmaster General Suleiman Msofe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania Communications Commission, as the regulator of such service in Tanzania, was represented by E.N. Madeje and F.B. Mdachi, a director of Postal Affairs and senior legal officer respectively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITED NATIONS, New York (PANA) - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has commended African leaders for their efforts to end the five-month war in Zaire, where anti-government forces are trying to overthrow President Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to applaud Africa leaders for having come together to try and solve the crisis in Zaire,&quot; Annan said in reference to the recent summit of the Organisation of African Unity on conflict resolution in Lome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a major test for the continent and I applaud their efforts,&quot; he said in a live radio programme with broadcasters on five continents, Wednesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the broadcast, which originated from the studios of U.N. Radio in New York, Annan fielded questions from correspondents of radio stations in Australia, Germany, India, Japan, Kenya, Netherlands, South Africa and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan, who attended the Lome summit, said he was encouraged by the result, and that based on the agreement signed between the Zairian government and the rebels, he expected the parties to agree on a cease-fire and commencement of talks soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. announced Tuesday that the parties had agreed to begin talks in South Africa this weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the alleged involvement of the government of Angola and the former rebel group Unita in the Zairian crisis, Annan said he had warned both President Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi to stay away from the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have indicated to them how dangerous it would be if they and other governments in the region were to get involved in the conflicts in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They both indicated to me that they were not involved and that they were equally concerned about the developments in Zaire,&quot; said Annan, who recently visited Angola as part of his African trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the proposed deployment of U.N. observers to Sierra Leone to help implement the country's peace agreement, Annan said that the deployment would be made as soon as the U.N. was able to secure the consent of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lack of consent from the rebel group, which signed a peace agreement in 1996 with the Sierra Leonean government, to end five years of civil war, has delayed the deployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am aware of the change in the leadership of RUF and my special representative in Sierra Leone is in touch with the new leadership,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have indicated that when the new leadership is established our military experts will brief them on our operational concept and the plans we had in mind for the implementation of the peace process and we will move ahead with the deployment,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) has re-affirmed that the island of Goree, west of the Senegalese capital, Dakar, is a landmark of the 18th century European slave trade in Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unesco Director-General Federico Mayor told journalists Wednesday in Dakar that nothing could reverse the historical importance of the island from where thousands of Africans were shipped into servitude across the Atlantic Ocean, by European slave dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor, a Spaniard, was commenting on the recent controversy generated by a section of the French media, which claimed that the importance of Goree in the slave trade had been exaggerated by Senegalese authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goree is one of Unesco's World Heritage sites. Mayor likened the island to Hiroshima, in Japan, where thousands of people were killed by United States atomic bombs in the Second World War.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor announced that Unesco had provided 160,000 U.S. dollars for the construction of the Goree-Almadies memorial. This monument is to serve as a permanent symbol of the abominable trade of Africans, now in the diaspora.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to Unesco's &quot;Culture of Peace&quot; projects which have been introduced in several conflict-ridden African countries, Mayor brushed aside arguments that these could not succeed without self sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are arguments of self-seeking dictatorial elites whose intention is to perpetuate themselves into power,&quot; Mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The peace project got a boost when the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke of it in his first address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This shows that the entire U.N. system is behind the peace culture project, &quot; Mayor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project also enjoys the backing of African states, including Senegal and Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe will become the current chairman of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to assess the Culture of Peace Project in Burundi, where there are still reports of ethnic killings, Mayor said although Unesco condemned such actions, it was not discouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Through our House of Peace in Bujumbura, we shall continue to promote dialogue between the various Burundian ethnic groups and encourage free expression for all,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor denounced the suffering innocent Burundian civilians were going through because of the regional sanctions which were imposed in July after Maj. Pierre Buyoya grabbed power in a military coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are innocent. Humanitarian assistance must be independent from political considerations,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his expectations of the ongoing African regional consultation on higher education, Mayor said he expected a consensus on certain principles which will be incorporated into the documents of the 1998 World Conference on Higher Education in Paris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the funding of higher education, Mayor said there was need for major African industrialists and other businessmen to join in funding of university research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While donors were willing to fund university research projects, he said, there was a limit to external aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, he said, international donors will find it unacceptable to finance research in countries where governments invested heavily in &quot;weapons of destruction&quot; instead of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mayor was in Dakar for the four-day African Regional Consultation on Higher Education. This meeting is preparing a continental position for next years world conference on the subject, scheduled for September 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC - A two-year study to determine whether vaginal contraceptive film containing spermicide used with condoms prevents the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has concluded that the spermicidal film is safe to use but does not confer any additional protection to women from HIV, gonorrhea or chlamydia infection beyond the protection provided by condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family Health International (FHI), a nonprofit research organization that specializes in reproductive health, collaborated with the Cameroon Ministry of Public Health to conduct the study in the African country. The research, designed to assess a spermicidal film containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9), did not address whether N-9 film used alone offers STD protection. Ronald E. Roddy, MPH, an FHI epidemiologist, and Leopold Zekeng, PhD, a Cameroon ministry HIV specialist, were the principal investigators.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latex condoms offer the best STD protection for people at risk, but many women are unable to persuade their partners to use them. FHI believes protective measures that are used and controlled by women are urgently needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately, the news is not good for women, since we had hoped N-9 might increase their available options for HIV protection,&quot; said Willard Cates Jr., MD, MPH, FHI's senior vice president for biomedical affairs. &quot;We must accelerate research dedicated to finding new methods for women at risk of HIV and other STDs.&quot; HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">N-9 is available worldwide in many formulations, including foams, gels, suppositories and creams. Women who use diaphragms, for example, typically apply N-9 cream or jelly to the diaphragm, and some latex condom lubricants include N-9. None of these other products were examined in the study. Also, the study only examined women and did not consider whether N-9 film protects men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study was supported by a $1.6 million grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). &quot;We believe this is the most thorough examination to date involving an N-9 spermicide and the role spermicides play in protecting women against STDs,&quot; said Dr. Cates. (MORE) &quot; This finding raises doubts about the additional benefit from using N-9 film as a prophylactic against STDs with condoms. It does not alter our advice to people who are at risk from infection with HIV or other STDs - they should use latex condoms correctly and consistently,&quot; he said. An alternative option for many women is to use the female condom, which may provide STD protection if used consistently and correctly. Abstinence or a mutually monogamous relationship between uninfected partners are the most reliable ways of preventing STD infection, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, smaller N-9 studies had suggested that N-9 may reduce the risk of bacterial STD infections, but were inconclusive about whether N-9 prevents HIV infections. The new study involved 1,292 sex workers in Cameroon who volunteered at clinics to take part in the study between March 1995 and December 1996. To be eligible, the women could not be infected with HIV at the time they entered the study. Of the eligible volunteers, 478 completed the study who were provided a contraceptive film containing N-9 and 463 completed the study who were provided a placebo film that did not contain a spermicide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each woman who asked about participating in the study received counseling to discourage her from continuing as a sex worker (prostitution), an activity that places one at great risk of acquiring HIV or other STD infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Volunteer participants who remained at risk were given condoms and urged to use them with every act of intercourse. They received a new supply of condoms frequently, and were examined monthly and treated for infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Cameroonian study staff strongly urged volunteers to practice safer sex,&quot; Dr. Cates said. Volunteers from the cities of Yaounde and Douala received thorough counseling and were asked to return monthly for medical attention, which FHI believes significantly reduced the risks they otherwise would have faced. &quot;Study participants were helped to adopt protected behaviors, which reduced their rate of infection by more than 50 percent,&quot; Dr.  Cates said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the women completing the study, 147,996 acts of sexual intercourse in the group using N-9 film and condoms were compared with 146,942 acts in the group provided with the placebo film and condoms. The rate of HIV transmission was nearly the same for both groups. For 100 women using N-9 film and condoms for one year (100 woman-years), 6.7 became infected with HIV, compared with 6.6 HIV infections using the placebo film and condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comparable rates for gonorrhea infections were 33.3 infections for N-9 and condoms to 31.1 for placebo film and condoms per 100 woman-years.  Infection rates for chlamydia were 20.6 for N-9 and condoms and 22.2 for placebo film and condoms per 100 woman-years. (MORE) A theoretical concern has been whether frequent use of N-9 may increase the risk of STD infections, since frequent use of the chemical may cause sores that could enhance transmission. Women in the study reported using the film more frequently than do most women who use N-9. This study did not show any increased risk of HIV or other STD infections from using N-9 film, although genital lesions (sores) did occur slightly more often among women who used N-9. There were 42.2 lesions per 100 woman-years among women using N-9 and condoms, compared with 33.5 lesions among women using the placebo film and condoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study has certain limitations. Because of the paramount concern for the safety of participants, they were counseled to use condoms every time they had sex, the only proven method of protection. Since few women reported using film without condoms, the study cannot conclusively address whether N-9 film alone offers any protection from HIV or other STDs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worldwide, about two thirds of all HIV-infected people live in the sub- Saharan region of Africa. One benefit of the study, Dr. Cates said, is that it demonstrates that HIV prevention research among people at high risk of infection can be done according to the highest ethical standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based in North Carolina, FHI is a research and technical assistance organization dedicated to improving reproductive health worldwide, with an emphasis on developing countries. The film used in the study is made by Apothecus Pharmaceutical Corp., Oyster Bay, NY and is available under the brand name of VCF Vaginal Contraceptive Film.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmos hosted Eleven Men in Flight from Swaziland in this game and according to Shube, Sono collected R 54 354 from the gate takings - the association was due to receive R 5 435 which Sono is allegeded to have refused to pay.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shube told City Press that Sono told them that Mpumalanga's MEC for Sports( Arts and Culture, Lassy Chiwayo instructed Sono not to pay the association their 10% because his department played a major role in bringing Cosmos to play at the Kanyamazane stadium..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sono refused to pay the association stating that he got instructions from Chiwayo not to pay us - to me that is totally unfair because the association also played an important role in arraging the game and besides it is a normal procedure that the association receives a 10% share in any game at the stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So there is no way that we can give Sono a special treatment here,&quot; said Shube.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 13-year-old girl, who is a minor and may not be identified, told police earlier that the James Shabangu had raped her repeatedly on three consecutive days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girl alleged that every time she went to play with Shabangu's granddaughter, he would send his granddaughter out on errands and drag the 13- year-old into his bedroom to rape her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bedroom is only metres from her own house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During cross-examination, Shabangu asked the girl why, if he had raped her so near home, she had not cried out for help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also asked why, if he had raped her over three consecutive days, she had continued to come to his house of her own free will and had not informed her family sooner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girl could not answer and under further cross-examination admitted that she had made up the charges at the prompting of her older sister, Zodwa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She failed to give the court an explanation or motive for making the charges up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate Albertus le Roux admonished the girl for wasting the courts time but did not press perjury charges against her. Le Roux ordered that all charges against Shabangu be dropped immediately.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . ZAIRE - Complex Emergency, Fact Sheet 8, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, April 3, 1997. Note: The last fact sheet was dated April 1, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background: In mid-October, 1996 fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance gaining territory on all fronts. The Alliance now controls the eastern fifth of Zaire. On March 15, the Alliance captured Kisangani. As the Alliance advances towards its next stated goal of Lubumbashi, it has already seized Kamina, a strategic rail junction located to the northwest of Lubumbashi, and Kasenga, 200 km northeast of Lubumbashi. Talks between Alliance and Zairian government authorities are expected to begin in South Africa on April 5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected: The initial fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 890,000 Rwandans to return to Rwanda, 64,000 Burundians to repatriate and hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. There were 39,000 registered internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kisangani and missionary sources report that 4,000 IDPs have left Kisangani to return home. Recent estimates of the scattered refugee concentrations include: 6,000 - 8,000 in Punia; up to 3,000 in Lodja, 250 km west of Kindu; and 1,300 in Mbuji-Mayi, Kasai- Oriental province, with another 8,000 more reportedly en route. At least 80, 000 refugees are clustered in several groups along the 125 km rail line west of the Zaire river between km 19 and 52 south of Kisangani. According to refugees, the former Rwandan army (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe militia members have separated from the refugees gathered along the rail line. On March 31, the United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that 20,000 - 30,000 fairly healthy refugees emerged at the village of Karuba, 13 km west of Sake. Another 2,500 emerged at Tongo, west of the former camps of Katale and Kahindo, north of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Humanitarian Situation: On March 31, the Alliance ordered refugees at Lula, seven km from Kisangani, to join refugees located at km 25. Only 700 of the most vulnerable refugees remain at Lula. At km 19 and 25, relief workers set up systems to chlorinate and filtrate water from tributaries of the Zaire river. Many of the refugees at km 41 appear severely malnourished and are unable to walk any farther. Very few refugees there have cooking pots, plastic sheeting, and other personal items. On April 1, a WFP train carried 120 metric tons (MT) of food for refugees concentrated along the rail line.  WFP reports sufficient food stocks, including a barge which is traveling up the Zaire river toward Kisangani, with 260 MT of food. UNHCR submitted a plan to the Alliance and to the Government of Rwanda for repatriation of refugees along the rail line, but has not yet received a response. In the meantime, UNHCR has flown 2846 refugees from Tingi Tingi and Amisi to Goma, where they are repatriated and admitted to Gisenyi hospital in Rwanda. UNHCR began trucking the refugees in Karuba and Tongo directly to the Rwandan border on April 1, with 4750 transported on April 1 and 2. In March, 8627 Rwandan refugees repatriated from eastern Zaire. Zairians are also receiving assistance. Foraging by the refugees, ex-FAR, and Interahamwe affected villages between Ubundu and km 52. WFP plans to provide food-for-work distributions to affected Zairian populations, in exchange for help in improving the road parallel to the railway line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Assistance: On March 14, USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) arrived in the region to help advance relief efforts in eastern Zaire. USAID/DART installed an information officer in Nairobi and a field officer in Goma. On March 30, USAID/DART visited major refugee concentrations along the railway line south of Kisangani, accompanied by WFP and Alliance officials. Two doctors from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived on April 3 and will be seconded to UNICEF/Goma.  BHR/OFDA and the State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration (State/PRM) have provided funding to the International Committee of the Red Cross to assist internally displaced Zairians and repatriating Rwandan refugees. State/PRM has also approved a $3 million contribution to UNHCR for Rwandan refugees repatriating from eastern Zaire. Between December and February, BHR's Office of Food for Peace provided roughly 2,500 MT of food to eastern Zaire from the Rwanda Regional Program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Western Cape has defiantly produced its first deficit budget ever, putting it on course for a collision with central government</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape budget delivered by Finance MEC Mr Kobus Meiring yesterday was, inevitably, bound to say as much about politics in the province as about its fiscus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event Meiring took the unprecedented step of budgeting for a deficit - of R247 million - in a blunt signal that the National Party-dominated provincial government feels it has been unfairly treated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At issue is the equity formula for allocation of money to the provinces, being applied for the first time this year. Central government argues, in essence, that the formula will address historic imbalances.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meiring says that rigid application of the five-year equity plan during a time of low economic growth will kill the proverbial goose that laid the golden egg. The Democratic Party hits out at central government's &quot; mechanistic approach&quot; to the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC in the Western Cape claims that the province's allocation of R2 197 a person this year is above the national average of R 1 755 a person anyway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the political arguments, there is little doubt that the ordinary person in the Western Cape will be hit by the budget. There will be fewer hospital beds for the ill, less equipment for schoolchildren (who will be in bigger classes) and an end to many construction projects and the jobs they provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can only hope that central government and the provincial authorities will bear these people in mind as they head for an inevitable clash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria can help by ensuring that plans for provincial revenue generation are brought to rapid fruition. And the NP in the Western Cape would do well to reflect on the fact that the province's voters are looking to it to find solutions, not scapegoats.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Black empowerment groups are to take a bigger share in fast- growing LA Retail Stores following the clothing chain'sR116-million takeover of Skye Products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA Stores managing director AK Peer said told the Cape Argus yesterday that several empowerment groups, including Cape-based Brimstone Investments, the National Empowerment Corporation and the trade-union controlled Community Growth Fund had taken &quot;a nice chunk&quot; of the group's capital through a share issue to fund the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R115,6-million purchase of Skye will be financed by the issue of 4 million shares at R4,25 each to Skye's controlling shareholder Brian Zylstra and Skye management, and the issue of 24,6 million non-voting shares at R4 each to institutional investors and empowerment groups.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peer said all the major institutions had taken a stake. He would not give details of the shareholdings but market sources said though the deal would dilute the Peer family's stake slightly, AK and Fuzzy Peer would still hold a majority interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like LA Stores, Skye is not a manufacturer but a distributor of branded clothing and also of footwear, supplying more than 3 000 retailers as well as national chains such as Edgars, Total Sports and Sales House. Brands distributed include Mille, Jump, Brentwood, Saucony and Dickie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the clothing and 25 percent of the footwear is made in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal includes a guarantee of Skye making profits of R22 million before tax in its current year which ends in February. In its last financial year, the group delivered profits of R17,5 million before tax, on turnover of R110 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peer said 85 percent of Skye's products were aimed at the mass market and a partnership with a black company &quot;made good business sense&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, we have similar management styles,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The businesses would keep their separate identities and management teams.  Each would continue to design, develop and market its own products, Mr Peer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA Stores' Samson brand of workwear would move into Skye's branding division. The Samson brand was inherited from clothing company Ensign when LA Stores listed through the Ensign cash shell on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA Stores' shares were trading yesterday at R5,90, more than double October's listing price of R2,76.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Banned former refugee educationist, Allie Fataar, who was forced to flee South Africa to avoid being sent to Robben Island, was honoured with a belated hero's welcome and life membership of the New Unity Movement (NUM) while celebrating his 80th birthday at Easter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allie's eyes beamed with pride while tributes poured in, recalling the dark days of the apartheid era when he and his wife, Ursula, fled into exile 29 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tributes were heaped on him by a panel of political comrades, theologians, educationists and civil rights leaders at a special birthday celebration in the Athlone Civic Centre on Good Friday to commemorate his role in helping to liberate South Africa from apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allie vividly recalls the price he had to pay for becoming the secretary of the anti-apartheid teacher fraternity association, the Teachers' League of South Africa, and for entering the extra-parliamentary political arena as a founder member of the Non-European Unity Movement, later renamed the New Unity Movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview in his flat in Wynberg, Allie, a former English master and senior assistant to the principal at Livingstone High School in Claremont, told how his persecution began when he was banned in 1961 under the Suppression of Communism Act and how this was followed by years of persistent security police harassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was ironic that I had to leave the country on the same day that I was to be inducted as the deputy principal of Livingstone High,&quot; he said. &quot;I had to flee into exile in 1964 when I was told that members of the Special Branch would be there to arrest me for allegedly violating my banning order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allie's flight from South Africa led to great financial hardship and eventually to an upheaval which scattered his family to three continents.  With the benefit of hindsight, however, he says he has few regrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes it did lead to new opportunities in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe which would not have been available to him in South Africa - where key posts were reserved for whites in terms of the of job reservation system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beyond South Africa's borders, Allie advanced progressively to key administrative posts such as a senior inspector of schools, curriculum developer responsible for developing an English syllabus for pupils from Grade 1 to Cambridge O-level (school leaving certificate) and a technical educational controller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;I would never, never have had these opportunities in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It broadened my educational horizons from being teacher to an educational administrator. I can truly say I am a teacher of southern Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things were not always that rosy. As a refugee, Allie initially had to work in a shop in Lobatsi, Botswana, until word spread that he was a qualified teacher. After being appointed to his first teaching post, he never looked back and went on to other posts of advancement in Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Allie has many nostalgic memories of his pupils, he believes his best class was in 1967 at the SerUwe Swaneng School in Botswana in 1967, where pupils came from a seriously deprived environment. His policy was to teach pupils and to push them up the educational ladder to top levels in a variety of academic fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Adversity was the finest master and the strong desire of my pupils to be diligent pupils and to do well was absolutely overwhelming,&quot; Allie said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His finest memories, however, are of his 27 years in Cape Town while he was teaching at Livingstone, the high school he attended as pupil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us at Livingstone there was liberation with education unlike almost every other black school in the country which had succumbed to the ideas liberation first and education later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of my ex-students are scattered around the world. Years after teaching them I have heard from them in a variety of key posts in Africa, Europe, Australia, Canada and even on Christmas Island!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With enthusiasm, Allie says he is looking with renewed hope to the upliftment of South Africa and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from his achievements, Allie is a devoted father to his five sons.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - As Cape Town gets into the swing of winning the hearts and minds of visiting International Olympic Committee members, one of the toughest challenges it faces is countering the perception that its shortlist ranking was merely a &quot;concession&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This perception, especially prevalent in Europe, has been reinforced by the influential German sports newsletter Sport Intern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Editor and publisher of the newsletter Karl-Heinz Huba is rather condescending about Cape Town's inclusion in the shortlist. This, he concludes, &quot;was a concession which was met with a great deal of sympathy&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He goes on: &quot;That the gesture will be sufficient to qualify Cape Town as the venue for the 2004 Games is, however, extremely questionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reservations do not only result from the question of what will happen in South Africa after Mandela', but also the question raised within the evaluation commission as to how a possibly luxurious Olympic Village could exist alongside the slums of Cape Town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huba rates Rome as the best of the five and comments favourably on the other three Athens, Buenos Aires and Stockholm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Europeans are no doubt as pleased as punch at Sport Intern's assessment but there is an argument that Cape Town could benefit from being discounted by its European rivals on the grounds that it is unlikely that Africa is able to mount a competitive bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company is, in fact, mounting a fiercely competitive bid and is going all out to convince individual IOC members to vote for a unique proposal which will reinvigorate Olympic ideals and offer a fresh vision for the Olympic Movement in the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By all accounts, Europe is not expecting a sophisticated lobbying exercise and there is at least a chance they will be taken by surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this sense, the perception that Cape Town's inclusion in the race is merely a concession is being strongly countered in this final lobbying stage among the people who really matter the voting members of the IO</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A strong risk existed that the wine industry could lose out on business opportunities if KWV's conversion from a co-operative to a company was delayed, KWV counsel Philip Ginsburg told the Cape High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was arguing yesterday against an application by Agriculture and Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom for an order effectively delaying the conversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Co-operative Wine Growers' Association of South Africa and the KWV Group Co-operative are asking the court to sanction a change in KWV's legal status from a co-operative to a company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In December, 83,8 percent of wine farmers representing KWV voted for the change. The co-op also asked the court to approve its application for the Wine and Spirits Control Act to be amended to allow KWV to become a private company and for confirmation of a reduction of share capital in terms of the Co-Operatives Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister is asking that KWV's application be postponed until affidavits are produced that could affect the court's decision to sanction the conversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ginsburg said the proposed scheme of arrangement had been properly approved by special resolutions passed at meetings held by KWV, as set out in an earlier court order. He said new business opportunities beneficial to the wine industry and South Africa as a whole could be lost if the conversion process was delayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theo Beckerling, SC, for the Minister argued that if KWV was converted to a public company it would no longer be qualified to carry out the powers and duties vested in it by the Wine and Spirit Control Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its assets are intended to serve the interests of the industry as a whole, and are not intended for the sole use and interest of KWV's members,&quot; he said.  The hearing continues today. Mr Justice W J Louw is on the Bench.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Western Cape government has slashed education, health and housing spending in its budget tabled in the provincial legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The budget, unveiled yesterday by provincial Finance Minister Kobus Meiring, makes provision for a R247-million deficit. A request for more money was turned down by national Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The education budget is cut by R347-million, the health budget by R250- million, the agriculture budget by R23-million and housing, local government and planning by R9,6-million. But the police budget was almost doubled from R3,7-million to R6,3-million and welfare spending has been increased by R80- million. The sport and recreation budget has been increased by R13-million to R20,9-million. Of this amount, R11-million is earmarked for the Olympic Bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transport and public works spending increases by R80-million to R750,9- million. Of this, R93-million will go to &quot;special&quot; Olympic projects, R50- million to transport projects and R43-million to sports priority projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring said the number of beds at Groote Schuur and Tygerberg hospitals would be cut to 1 000 and 1 200 respectively. School class sizes would increase to save money and payments to old-age homes would be pegged at 1996/7 levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other cost-cutting measures included the scrapping of all new construction projects and capital expenditure other than for computers and medical equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a very sad day for the Western Cape and a very difficult year, perhaps the most difficult year in our history,&quot; Mr Meiring said. &quot;On one hand our block grant is cut while on the other we are not yet allowed to augment our own income.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring did not rule out the possibility of taking Constitutional Court action to secure more money for the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province budgeted for total spending of R9,525-billion. The bulk is for health (26 percent), education (35 percent), social services (23 percent) and transport and public works (eight percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central government will fund 91,93 percent of this, while provincial income, mainly from hospital fees and car licences, makes up 5,28 percent.  The balance is set off against the deficit (2,59 percent) and provincial revenue account income (0,2 percent).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Manuel has said the overall allocation to the province increased in nominal terms from R8 378-million in 1996/97 to R8 757-million for the 1997/98 financial year. The Western Cape allocation of R2 197 for every person was much higher than the national average of R1 755 a person, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring said that if non-discretionary allocations of R1 183-million - which included R971-million for improvements of conditions of service and R120-million to improve social pensions - were taken into account, the province was allocated R780,5-million less than last year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The conflict between Cape Flats gangsters and Pagad seems to be intensifying in the number of attacks and counter-attacks and in the weapons being used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff Reporter JOSEPH ARANES spoke to the two parties and the police to establish whether an all-out war could be averted</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just after midnight on Wednesday last week, Aaron Mapeko, an alleged Mitchell's Plain drug dealer, and his family were in bed about to go to sleep when all hell broke loose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unknown attackers lobbed a petrol bomb and a handgrenade at their house and raked it with gunfire. Fortunately, nobody was injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other side of the Peninsula, People against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) leader Abdus-Salaam Ebrahim had just switched his Lansdowne house lights off and gone to bed when he and his family were woken by two explosions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, unknown attackers had tossed two M26 grenades at the bedrooms of the house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the explosion shattered the windows and damaged the house, Mr Ebrahim and his family were not hurt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past seven months the number of attacks has increased dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initially most were directed at the homes of alleged drug dealers and gangsters, creating the perception that there were people who wanted the gangsters to retaliate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Pagad and the Community Outreach Forum (Core), the organisation representing gangsters - who say they have reformed - allege a &quot;third force&quot; is responsible for the attacks, a claim the police are investigating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guns, grenades and home-made bombs were used in the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A worrying factor is that homemade explosive devices have become more lethal and powerful and it is more luck than anything else that many have failed to ignite, thus not causing injuries or deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the banner of Core, most of the attacks were condemned, but no retaliatory action was taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Core continued spreading their gospel of peace and claimed that a &quot;third force&quot; was responsible for the attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past weeks, more and more Pagad supporters have become targets of gunmen who sometimes carried petrol bombs and grenades too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad has condemned the attacks and vowed to continue with its anti-drugs campaign in spite of the intimidation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ebrahim said his organisation believed there were forces intent on undermining the Government and who were using the gangsters as tools to achieve that objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Core is small fry in this equation, this fight is bigger than many people think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are agencies who want to destabilise the Government and throw the country into civil war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said agencies of the previous government were still intent on getting back political control and were trying to use Pagad's campaign to create disillusionment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ebrahim alleged there were people in Parliament who were involved in the drug trade and that several economic giants were guilty of committing atrocities against people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These people needed to appear before the Truth Commission so their illegal activities could be exposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These crimes are worse than the apartheid crimes as people are still being drugged and oppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pagad is not anti-government, but we are out to save the country from destruction and stop the intelligence agencies, local and international, from destabilising the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they had a simple message for the Government - get rid of drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government must also get rid of corrupt criminal justice officials and use the necessary force to deal with the problem as 'third force' elements are trying to undermine them,&quot; said Mr Ebrahim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Core does not agree with Pagad's strategy of marches and threats, it believes, too, that there are other forces with devious motives using the conflict to cause mayhem and strife on the Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Core spokesman Ernie &quot;Lapepa&quot; Peters said that while they agreed with Pagad that drugs were unacceptable, marches would not rid society of this evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pagad should be promoting peace and educating people about the evils of drug abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As drug dealers we have stated on numerous occasions that we are prepared to stop dealing if we are given a chance to find an alternative income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are prepared to sit around the table with Pagad and the government to discuss their concerns and come up with solutions to this crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the continuous threats and attacks on homes of merchants are testing our resolve, as an organisation committed to peace, to the limits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peters said if the attacks continued it would become more difficult for Core to control their members, many of whom were intent on retaliating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The gangs are looking to Core for leadership and we are calling for peace, but all these attacks and public threats to the lives of our members and the fact that the police have not arrested anyone for the bombings are placing us in a very difficult position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said information from their sources within the police indicated that police got orders from their top structure not to arrest or act against Pagad members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Both the National Party and African National Congress are using this tension between Pagad and Core as a political football and don't want to find ways of resolving it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NP controls the provincial government and the ANC rules nationally, but both have failed to come up with mechanisms to deal with the problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said both parties were sitting on the fence watching developments and would get involved only if they thought they could gain political mileage and votes from it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both had skeletons in their cupboards which they wanted to keep there and the only way of keeping them locked away was for them to do nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the police have come in for a lot of criticism from all sides for their handling of the situation, they say they are doing their best to keep the peace, arrest the offenders and prevent an all-out war between the groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of the violent crimes unit Leonard Knipe said the police were extremely concerned that the conflict could escalate and were putting as many resources and personnel as possible into the field to avoid that happening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it should be remembered that the police were dealing with highly sophisticated networks of drug smugglers and bombers which were difficult to police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we have made several arrests and confiscated numerous firearms, explosive devices and drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would appear the attacks are being carried out by different groups of people and allegations of 'third force' involvement are being taken seriously and investigated,&quot; said Director Knipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said homemade bombs being used were becoming bigger and more powerful and could be made by almost anyone with a little knowledge of chemicals as the substances could be bought at any good hardware store.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the police have appealed to people with information about bomb- makers to come forward, people were reluctant and genuinely scared as the danger of having their own houses blown up or shot at was very real.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Knipe said that in spite of this, police were conducting their work in a professional manner and were having phenomenal success in arresting people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are scared that open warfare could erupt between the groups and we are doing everything in our power to prevent this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have arrested several Pagad supporters for the illegal possession of firearms and gangsters are being arrested,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police statistics showed serious violent crimes were down, with 572 people arrested in connection with 256 cases last year, compared with 460 people arrested in 1995 in connection with 549 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several known gang leaders and alleged drug dealers were being investigated and several cases were pending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Director Knipe said not many of the other top gangsters and drug dealers had cases against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have taken out several middle men and while we don't believe the big guys have stopped their activities, we have just not linked them to cases yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And this is not because of a lack of trying on the part of the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can lock them away only if we catch them and we are endeavouring to do just that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Tourists and conservationists say the revamped Cape Point tourist complex is a fiasco, with visitors having to put up with traffic chaos, aggressive baboons, long queues and the stench of raw sewage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems at the new R13-million complex have drawn increasing complaints from visitors, especially foreigners. Cape Point, one of the Peninsula's premier tourist sites, had 750 000 visitors last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R3,5-million funicular which takes visitors to the viewing site at the point has carried 150 000 passengers since it opened in December but has been plagued by breakdowns.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other facilities, too, cannot cope. The sewerage system serving the new complex has broken down and the smell of raw sewage pervades the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a severe lack of parking and the restaurant and fast food shop appear unable to cope with demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In spite of the best efforts of a &quot;baboon chaser&quot;, increasing numbers of aggressive baboons are posing a threat to visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmentalists have warned it will cost millions to rectify all the problems without disturbing the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The developer, Concor, has acknowledged that facilities are inadequate in peak periods and says further development is needed to cope with increased demand. The Cape Metropolitan Council, the &quot;owner&quot; of the reserve, says the complex was never designed to handle the numbers now visiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservationists predicted many of the problems when the complex was being planned, but they were ignored by the developers. They fought to the bitter end to prevent the restaurant complex being built on its present site because the area was too small. Their worst fears are now being realised. Waste from the restaurant kitchen shares a soakaway sewer with the complex's toilets and the system is blocked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The narrow entrance road to Cape Point is often congested for kilometres with cars parked on both sides. The main parking area is too small to cope with cars and up to 20 tour buses at a time in a space designed to take eight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans for another parking area at Cape Point or at nearby Rooikrantz and a shuttle service have also been condemned by conservationists. Long queues form at the fast food shop and 200-seat restaurant, which battle to cope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peter Salter, chairman of the Simon's Town Flora Conservation Group, said the decision to move the restaurant from the Homestead to its present site was taken without public participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We warned what would happen when you concentrate all your facilities in one small area at the Point.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Simon's Town councillor Diane Salter said Cape Point could not possibly cope with the large numbers of visitors. &quot;We feel very sorry that these issues were not looked at more closely in the beginning, but what's done is done. We now have to focus on how the increasing numbers should be managed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concor director Leo Rohrig acknowledged there were problems with facilities which were inadequate during peak times. &quot;But you can't lay out a facility according to peak demand. It will be boring and empty for the rest of the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concor and the Cape Metropolitan Council could not have predicted the dramatic increase in visitors from 350 000 in 1994 to 750 000 last year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the sewage problem could be overcome technically at a cost of no more than R200 000. The sewers would be doubled to take care of future growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Rohrig confirmed that the funicular occasionally had technical problems which he blamed on its complicated alignment and the fact that it was locally made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there was no way parking could be increased because of physical constraints. He urged people to go by bus during peak hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The old Homestead restaurant in the centre of the nature reserve was never considered as the site for the new restaurant, but was now being looked at as a relief measure during peak periods, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Limits on the size of the restaurant were imposed by conservationists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact the development had been delayed a year and costs had increased by 30 to 40 percent as a result of having to implement conservationists' proposals,&quot; Mr Rohrig said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Metropolitan Cpuncil chief executive Stewart Fisher said the problem was caused by large numbers of visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Our mandate here is to assist visitors to experience the beauty of the place in a manner that has minimum impact on the environment rather than to establish a high acreage of fast food outlets for visitors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said despite warnings, visitors still fed baboons which had become demanding and perhaps appeared intimidating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One alternative that has been suggested is that the entire baboon population be eradicated. This is obviously unacceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Fisher added that all the problems could be rectified without having a major impact on the environment and the unspoilt nature of the reserve.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The sporting mood in Nigeria Friday was one of hyper-expectation as the country's highly-favored &quot;Super Eagles&quot; take on Guinea's &quot;Syli Nationale&quot; Saturday in a crucial World Cup African Group qualification match, which the Nigerians must win to keep their France '98 hope alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After an unimpressive 2-0 win against Burkina Faso and a disappointing 1-1 draw with Kenya, the 1994 Africa Nations Cup champions are literally walking a tight rope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They now trail two points, behind the Syli stars, who have the maximum six from two games played by each of the four countries that make up the group.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According soccer buffs, the pressure is certainly on the Nigerians, who must win all their games, including Saturday's match against Guinea, to qualify for France '98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Raheem Adejumo, president of the Nigeria Olympic Committee concedes that much in his goodwill message to the Eagles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Nigerians should be guided by the same spirit that gave the country's Under-23 squad Olympic soccer gold in Atlanta, United States, in August 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On paper, Nigeria, parading an array of foreign-based stars, such as Austin &quot;Jay Jay&quot; Okocha, Daniel Amokachi, Emmanuel Amunike, Finidi George, Tijani Babangida and team captain Uche Okechukwu, to name but a few, should overrun the Guineans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Nigerians are worried that on current form, the Syli stars &quot;are no push overs&quot; to have topped the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Eagles must approach this match with utmost caution else the World Cup ticket will just slip off our hands,&quot; one fan counselled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team selection could also pose a problem, with the 23 players invited to national camp jostling for the 11 shirts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part from the precautionary measures by Nigerian soccer administrators was the decision to camp the Eagles in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, away from Lagos distractions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Syli stars also worked with the same theory, training in Mali ahead of Saturday's encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both teams flew into Lagos Thursday for the make or mar soccer battle at Nigeria's national stadium in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Team captain Titi Camara, who stars for Nantes of France, was the toast of soccer fans as the Guineans breezed into the Nigerian commercial city late Thursday. His team, too, boasts a number of other foreign-based professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Camara believes his colleagues are not intimidated by Nigerian big names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The game is for 22 players,&quot; he said. &quot;We are determined to win here (Lagos), because that will make our qualification easier.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such is the magnitude of the herculean task facing the Eagles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The burden lies squarely on the shoulders of the Eagles' new French coach, Phillipe Troussier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Frenchman, also called the &quot;White Witchdoctor,&quot; after his exploits of African soccer, is barely one month on the 10,000-U.S.-dollar a month job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits the task would not be easy. &quot;When people say we (Nigeria) will win, I feel flattered,&quot; he said. &quot;But when they begin to talk about the (goal) margin, I become uncomfortable. Of course I know we will win, but it's going to be tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Nigerian fans, fired by patriotic feeling, have predicted a margin of 3-0 or 4-0 against Guinea, but analysts caution that football is not mathematics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Anything can happen, especially when the home team is playing under intense pressure,&quot; a sports commentator said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe has so far this year granted asylum to 10 refugees fleeing civil war in Zaire and anticipates more as Zairian rebels, who have already captured four towns, are advancing and have rejected United Nations pleas for a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwean commissioner for refugees, Samuel Mhiribidi, said the country, which until 1995, accommodated over 200,000 Mozambican refugees, had structures in place if there was need to provide a safe haven for more Zairians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We already have a few Zairian refugees who have been coming here even before the start of the present conflict and there are more still coming,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said not more than 10 Zairians had been granted asylum in Zimbabwe since the beginning of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, over 6,000 people fleeing fighting in Zaire have so far crossed into neighbouring Zambia since October last year, and Zambian authorities say around 500 Zairians are entering the country daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairian rebels started their armed onslaught in October accusing authorities of denying them citizenship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, fighting has intensified with the rebels capturing a number of towns making government forces and civilians to flee to safety in neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe has said it will only consider granting asylum to Zairian refugees who can prove that they have been denied refugee status in countries which share borders with conflict-torn Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mhiribidi said anyone who got to Zimbabwean border posts seeking refugee status had to be allowed in the the country and the apply for asylum from within.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The immigration people know what to do with people who come to them as refugees. We have had several seminars with them on the subject,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe is currently faced with a convoy of trucks belonging to Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's son Nzanga, who is stranded at the Zambian town of Livingstone seeking authority to enter the country in transit to South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Mazi (Mr) Samuel Gomsu Ikoku, a renowned Nigerian politician and member of the current military regime's Transition Implementation Committee is dead. He was aged 71 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian special duties minister, Laz Unaogu, confirmed that Ikoku died &quot;in active service&quot; Thursday. He said the politician was in eastern Nigeria, his home region, to monitor the local council by-elections, held in parts of the country Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikoku or &quot;S.G,&quot; as he was fondly called by admirers, was a graduate of the London School of Economics. He was considered to be one of the first Nigerians to earn a masters' degree in that field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He joined politics at the age of 18 years in 1946, and subsequently defeated his father in a national election in 1957.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was a member of the federal parliamentary opposition Action Group founded by the late Nigerian politician Obafemi Awolowo in the government of the First Republic (1960-1966).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Second Republic (1979-1983), Ikoku co-founded the socialist- oriented Peoples Redemption Party with the late Malam Aminu Kano. But he later broke ranks to join deposed president Shehu Shagari's erstwhile National Party of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A controversial politician and public affairs commentator, Ikoku had often made it clear his philosophy in life was anchored on two concepts -- &quot; nationalism&quot; and &quot;humanism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ran as a candidate for the Action Group in an election in 1957 and defeated his father Alvan Ikoku, one of Nigeria's renowned politician and educationist, then a member of the defunct National Council of Nigerian Citizens, founded by Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first Nigerian head of state, who died in May 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the Nigerian civil war (1967-70), when the eastern region of the country led by the dominant Igbo group tried to secede from the federation, Ikoku, an Igbo, was on the federal side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was Nigeria's representative in France, where he campaigned against Paris' recognition of defunct Biafra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ikoku was also in Addis Ababa, as a member of the Nigerian team during peace talks to end the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outspoken politician was detained briefly by the Muhammadu Buhari regime over his 1984 book, &quot;Nigeria: Fourth Coup d'Etat,&quot; in which Ikoku advocated diarchy (civilian-military government) as a system of government for the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Rector of the University of Brazzaville, Prof Matondo Hubert, has called for the regionalization of certain specialized courses such as computer science as a cost cutting measure in the sector of higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be self defeating for each of countries in one region, such as central Africa, to introduce similar courses. The best option should be joint centers for such specialized fields, &quot; he told PANA on Friday in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said specialized regional university centers would even reduce the urge by parents to send their children abroad for such studies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have the required competence in our respective countries. What we need is to pool our resources to set up good regional institutions so that our children don't have to go to foreign countries where xenophobia is increasing, &quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matondo was in Dakar for an African regional consultation on higher education, which was organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the financing of higher education, the Rector said governments should continue funding university education, although internal efforts should be made by the institutions to generate funds through consultancy and research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cautioned, however, that the search for self-financing should not be at the expense of the mission of university to offer education, research and service to the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke against the tendency of African governments to rely on international aid to finance higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On what problems Brazzaville university faced, he said what he feared most was the rising trade unionism among students, which has gained intensity under Congo's new democratic era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he understood the concern of students about unemployment. &quot;In the past you went to the university to get a job. Now this is not the case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Kenya's Nairobi University, Prof.  Florida Karani, said the regional consultation in Dakar had enabled academicians and decision makers to &quot;take stock of the state of the art&quot; in the high education sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The meeting helped in clarifying certain issues, including the financing of higher education, curriculum and science and technology, which our scientists need to identify and adapt whatever is relevant to our African needs,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the often repeated complaint that women academicians were disadvantaged, Karani said the consultation in Dakar had provided an opportunity for the evolving strategies to reverse that anomaly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She urged African states to introduce affirmative actions as an interim measure to bridge between women and men academicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Governments would be better off if they increased the participation of women in development. Ignoring women, who constitute 50 percent of human resources is elf-defeating,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Lydia Makhubu of the University of Swaziland said that students at the institution she heads were very active in the ongoing debate on democracy in the kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she said this has not disrupted the university. On the representation of women at higher levels of universities, Makhubu said the situation was improving in certain countries but not in others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There also several women rectors in South Africa and as you can see Kenya is doing well. Progress is slow but it is there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assessing the meeting in Dakar, Makhubu said that basing on what transpired during debates, &quot;we shall come out with well INL002 from SSS.072 (970404-16: 01) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG071G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) focused recommendations to guide us in future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The preparatory meeting for next year's World Conference on Higher Education ends on Friday evening after the adoption of the &quot;Dakar Declaration on Higher Education In Africa&quot; and a plan of action.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe Sun Public Relations Manager Ray Mawerera said Southern Sun were the franchise holders of the Intercontinental Brand and the agreement would enable Zimsun to use it in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agreement covers human resource and infrastructural development and puts us on the intercontinental map,&quot; Mawerera said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We realized that strategic alliances are the future since tourism is increasingly becoming competitive and that a well known brand like Intercontinental is easier to sell,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elephant Hills Hotel becomes the second hotel under Zimsun to assume a new brand name after the Monomatapa in Harare changed to Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza Monomotapa in 1996, following a franchise agreement with Holiday Inn worldwide.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe and South Africa on Thursday signed the eagerly awaited agreement on textiles and clothing in a move widely regarded as the turning point in trade relations between the two neighbors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest development follows a breakthrough in August 1996 on the ongoing bilateral trade talks when Zimbabwe's industry and commerce minister, Nathan Shamuyarira and his South African counterpart, Alec Erwin, signed a memorandum of understanding on the two commodities. in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum of understanding, among other things, signalled agreement in principle on the rules of origin in relation to clothing and textiles as well as preferential tariff and quota levels for Zimbabwean clothing and textile exports to South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum, which was scheduled to be implemented from September 1, 1996, had to be delayed due to some technical procedural matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These have now been resolved and the two ministers said in a joint statement released at the end of talks held in Harare on Thursday that tariff preferences would be reinstated with immediate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was, however, agreed that the implementation process would be monitored closely to ensure smooth operation and the ministers noted that the latest initiatives could go a long way in narrowing the trade imbalance that had threatened to put a dent on relations between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to agricultural products, agreement on trade quotas was reached on a number of items although there were still a number of outstanding matters on which announcement was expected when the ministers meet in South Africa in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, little progress was made on &quot;other products,&quot; with the two sides agreeing that the issues under this area should be addressed in the context of a memorandum of understanding which is expected to be signed at their next meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memorandum of understanding would include all areas that had already been agreed to and will also cover investment and technical co-operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade is heavily skewed in favour of South Africa which posted a net surplus of seven billion Zimdollars (636 million U.S. dollars) in the first 10 months of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's business community had over the past five years accused South Africa of unfair trade practices following the removal of tariff preferences the Zimbabweans used to enjoy prior to the expiry in 1992 of the 1964 trade agreement between the two countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigerian head of state Sani Abacha and his Burkina Faso counterpart, President Blaise Compaore, have called for an immediate end to hostilities in eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two West African leaders said this was crucial for a negotiated settlement between the Kinshasa government and the Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Congo (Zaire) led by Laurent Kabila.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This appeal was contained in a joint communique Thursday at the end of Compaore's two-day visit to Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha and Compaore attended the two-day March 26 Lome Summit of the Organisation of Africa Unity's conflict resolution committee on Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that meeting, African leaders managed to bring Zaire's opposing sides together for the first time, after which they also agreed on early talks to end their five-month war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the first round of peace talks brokered by the United Nations and the O.A.U. are due to start Saturday in South Africa, reports from Zaire speak of apparent confusion within the Kinshasa government, while Kabila's alliance forces continue their advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha and Compaore also expressed concern at the recent escalation of the fighting in the horn of Africa. They called on African states to seek urgent solution to the problem using existing O.A.U. conflict resolution mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men called for the strengthening of continental economic integration through the OAU and sub-regional bodies such as the Economic Community of West African States, Ecowas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Effective bilateral and regional cooperation among the brotherly countries of the sub-region are necessary prerequisites for regional economic integration,&quot; they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha is chairman of the 16-nation Ecowas, which is mediating the conflict in a member country, Liberia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Situation Report #27, Fiscal Year (FY)1997, April 4, 1997. Note: The last situation report was dated March 28,1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporadic ethnic violence against the Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda, Tutsis of Rwandan origin, has erupted in the South Kivu and Masisi regions of Zaire since 1959. The violence escalated in 1995 and 1996, as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe), living as refugees in Eastern Zaire, attacked the Banyarwanda in the Masisi region. Subsequently in October 1996, the Government of Zaire (GOZ) sanctioned harassment of the Banyamulenge in South Kivu, provoking the fighting which broke out between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Banyamulenge rebels on October 14, 1996. The fighting began near Runingo refugee camp in South Kivu, Zaire, forcing about 220,000 refugees to flee the Uvira/Bukavu region. The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance), led by Laurent Kabila, a veteran foe of Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko.  The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from South Kivu, and south from Rutshuru to Goma, in North Kivu. On November 14, the Alliance counter-attacked against ex-FAR and Interahamwe elements in the Mugunga refugee camp in the Goma area, forcing them to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Rwanda. Other refugees fled north and west into Zaire and remain there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, Alliance troops have steadily advanced across Eastern Zaire: they captured Kisangani on March 15 and Kamina and Kasenga in late March, expanding theircontrol to an area 1,600 km long and 600 km west into Zaire. Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire, is their current objective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date): $129,859, 997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zaire - Refugees: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates 376,590 Rwandans and about 44,000 Burundians are stranded in Eastern Zaire. Of the 100,000 refugees who fled from Tingi-Tingi on March 1 to Ubundu, about 80,000 crossed the Zaire River and have gathered at Km 25, Km 41, and Km 82 on the rail line south of Kisangani. The 57,000 refugees estimated to have gathered near Km 25 are the healthiest, while the 31,000 near Km 41 and 82 are in urgent needof food, water, and medicine. On March 22, ex-FAR and Interahamwe elements reportedly separated from the refugees, with one armed group allegedly heading towards Opala, an inaccessible area about 100 km west of Ubundu. In the last two weeks, the U.N. airlifted 2,846 refugees from Tingi-Tingi and Amisi. On April 1, about 25,000 refugees appeared in Karuba, 13 km west of Sake, and are being repatriated to Rwanda, the UNHCR reported. Another 2,500 emerged in Tongo, to the west of the old Katale and Kahindo refugee camps north of Goma. In Ikela, 300 km southwest of Kisangani, about 4,000 refugees have reportedly gathered. In Mbuji-Mayi, Kasai-Oriental, there are reports of 2,000 refugees, and 40,000-50,000 are moving towards Angola. They are believed to be the group from Shabunda/Kindu.  At least 100,000 refugees in Eastern Zaire are unaccounted for.  Zaire - Internally Displaced (IDPs): 39,000 IDPs were registered in Kisangani, and missionaries in the city report that4,000 left to return to their homes. The U.N. estimates there are about 300,000 Zairian IDPs in Eastern Zaire. In Rwanda: According to the UNHCR, 1,033,405 Rwandan refugees returned to Rwanda from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania from November to December 1996, bringing to 1, 300,582 the number of returnees in 1996. From January to March 1997, another 75,947 refugees returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania. There are 9,000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda, the UNHCR reports. In Burundi: Of the 143,000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area of Zaire, some 93,000 refugees have returned to Burundi. From January through March 1997, 8,192 Burundians returned from Tanzania, and 5,764 returned from Zaire. In Tanzania: 13,500 Burundians have arrived in Tanzania from the Uvira region of Zaire.  In all, there are about 281,000 Burundianrefugees in Tanzania, and 87,957 Zairians, for a total of 368,957. Elsewhere in the Region: 4,820 Zairians remain in Uganda, down from 11,000, the UNHCR reported. About 7,500 Zairian refugees have fled to Zambia, most of them arriving in Mpulungu. The Government of Sudan is host to 10,000 Zairian refugees in the Bazi area of Western Equatoria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance troops continue to advance in the south in a pincer movement toward Lubumbashi, moving simultaneously along the Zaire-Zambian border and along the railway south of Kabongo. After seizing Kamina, the Alliance appears to be isolating Lubumbashi from the rest of GOZ-controlled Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the northern part of Alliance-controlled territory, rebel officials in Kisangani have delayed humanitarian efforts to repatriate some of the tens of thousands of Rwandan and Burundianrefugees who had fled the Alliance's advances since late1996. In the past week, the Alliance ordered the 26,000 refugees who had gathered in Lula, 7 km south of Kisangani, to retrace their steps south along the railway that runs to Ubundu. Citing security concerns, Alliance commanders appear to want the refugees to gather for repatriation at Ubundu, 125 km south of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance concerns may stem from a battle fought on March 22 between ex- FAR/Interahamwe members and the Alliance about 52 km south of Kisangani, according to Zairian eyewitnesses who spoke to the USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) on March 30. The Zairians reported that 98 people were killed in the battle. The encounter allegedly marked the end of the ex- FAR/Interahamwe control over the refugees who are now gathered along the rail line, awaiting repatriation. Some of the Rwandan fighters are also believed to have blended in with the refugees, but most have supposedly fled west towards Opala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Eastern Zaire continues to await Kabila's approval for a U.N. plan that envisions Kisangani as the base for repatriating the refugees along the railroad. The city has an international airport, unlike the grass strip at Ubundu, an alternative staging area.  Complicating repatriation plans, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) has requested that a tripartite agreement among the GOR, the U.N. and the Alliance be signed before repatriation could begin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of April 3, refugees were grouped near two kilometer markings along the rail line: about 50,000 generally healthy people at Kisesa, near Km 25, and about 30,000 at Biaro, near Km 41. The last group was in poor shape and included several thousand unaccompanied children. At Km 82, there about 1,000 refugees. Local villagers told USAID/DART they had buried about 200 corpsesin recent days. From Tingi-Tingi and Amisi, relief workers flew 2,846 refugees, most of them ill or weak, to Goma for eventual repatriation to Rwanda. The evacuation by air was completed on April 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USAID/DART is travelling regularly between Goma and Kisanganito coordinate relief efforts with the U.N. to determine how best to assist the refugees and IDPs.  After the Alliance seized Kisangani on March 15, USAID/DART also succeeded in securing the Alliance's clearance for the WFP's first food flightto Kisangani from Mwanza, Tanzania. On March 19, a WFP- chartered aircraft delivered 35 MT of food to Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of about 25,000 Rwandan refugees appeared on March 31 in Karuba, west of Sake, and Tongo, west of the former Katale and Kahindo camps. The refugees, reportedly in good condition, wished to go home. The UNHCR is organizing a gradual repatriation, which would involve 3,000 people crossing daily into Rwanda from Goma. On April 1 and 2, the UNHCR repatriated 4,750 Rwandans from Karuba and Tongo by truck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports have reached relief agencies of a mass of 40,000-50,000 refugees heading south from Mbuji- Mayi to the Angolan border. They may be part of the refugees who had fled Shabunda and Kindu earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights said in Geneva on April 2 that the Alliance had &quot;undoubtedly&quot; committed massacres during the past six months.  He recommended that an internationalinvestigative team be sent to Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As planning and negotiations with the Alliance continue, the broad U.N.  aims in Eastern Zaire are to provide assistance to therefugees, to enable them to regain the strength to repatriate on foot east to Rwanda and Burundi.  Seasonal rains, combined with Alliance stipulations, are complicating the tasks of planning, transporting, and distributing relief assistance. Many bridges also require repairs in the wake of the fighting. U.N. logisticians inspected the road from from Lobutu to Walikale, concluding that a 30-km stretch required repairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. plan for repatriating refugees from Eastern Zaire has three parts.  The first, the evacuation of people from Tingi-Tingi and Amisi to Goma, ended April 3. Contingent on Alliance approval, the second part would involve passenger flights between other parts of Eastern Zaire in Alliance control: Bunia, Kalemie, Kindu, Uvira, Bukavu, and Goma, and other accessible airstrips in areas where refugees are located. The third part involves the bulk of the 80,000 refugees grouped along the railroad south of Kisangani.  The UNHCR plans to airlift up to 20,000 of the most vulnerable from Kisangani to Kigali, if the Alliance provides access to the airport in Kisangani. The remainder would walk and be trucked to the Rwandan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After delays, a train from Kisangani transported 120 MT of pulsesand cereals for distribution at km 82 on March 27. A second train with another 120 MT delivered food along the rail line on April 1. USAID/DART reports that food stocks are adequate for the refugees along the railroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March, the U.N. repatriated 7,209 refugees from towns in the Goma region, including Kisharu, Tongo, Kalengera/Rugari, Sake/Mugungu, Karuba, and Kalungu. In Kingulube, east of Shabunda, the UNHCR and WFP have set up five way stations in preparation for the transit of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kisangani, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)is leading efforts to assist IDPs, reestablish water and sanitation services, and set up an emergency supply line to the area. The ICRC has received formal Alliance permission to fly toKisangani, Kalima, Kindu, Shabunda, Beni, and Bunia, and it plans to investigate the condition of the refugees and several thousand IDPs in the Kalima-Kindu area. The ICRC is planning twosets of way stations: along the 700 km route from Kisangani tothe Rwandan border, and to the south, on the route from Lulungeto Fizi and Uvira. In GOZ territory, ICRC workers commute daily from Ndola, Zambia to Lubumbashi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Developments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talks between the GOZ and the Alliance are set to begin April 5 in South Africa, according to news reports. The delegations do not include President Mobutu or Kabila. The arrangements emergedfrom a meeting in Lom', Togo, where the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held a summit on the Zaire crisis.  Mohamed Sahnoun, OAU and U.N. Special Representative to the Great Lakes, will lead the talks, his spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kinshasa, President Mobutu on April 2 appointed Etienne Tshisekedi, a veteran rival, as prime minister. He replaces Kengo wa Dondo, who resigned in mid-March. In Goma on March 26, an Alliance spokesman rejected any proposal to share power with Mobutu's party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Current Situation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cabinet reshuffle in the GOR on March 28 resulted in the dissolution of the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Integration (MiniReiso), with its responsibilities being absorbedby the Interior Ministry. This is significant, as MiniReiso worked most closely with the relief community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence in Rwanda continues. On April 2, five people in Ruhengeri prefecture were killed and two were kidnapped. Elsewhere in the prefecture, three people died in a battle between security forces and &quot;criminal elements,&quot; Radio Rwanda reported. Five people, including three civilians, died in fighting on March 24 between GOR security forces and the Interahamwe in Runda commune, Radio Rwanda reported. The U.N. reported that on March 19, unknown gunmen killed five Hutu and Tutsi children in a school in Kibuye prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report released by the United Nations Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda (HRFOR) states that human rights has &quot;drastically deteriorated&quot; since the new year. In January, HRFORreceived reports of at least 424 killings, the highest number since early 1996. Of the 424 killings, 228 were in Ruhengeri prefecture alone. Most relief efforts and human rightsmonitoring have been curtailed after foreign humanitarian workers in Rwanda were killed in January and February. The victims included a Canadian priest, three Spaniards who worked for Medicos del Mundo (MDM), and two expatriate human rights monitors and three Rwandans working for HRFOR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regular U.N. convoys transporting humanitarian assistance under military escort are underway between Kigali and Cyangugu, Kibuye, Gisenyi, and Ruhengeri. The WFP has also instituted regular flights to Gisenyi and Cyangugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing circumstances and renewed relief efforts in Eastern Zaire have increased refugee repatriations to Rwanda. WFP has moved 60 MT from the border crossing at La Petite Barri re in Rwanda to Goma, and M'decins Sans Fronti res (MSF) and Food for the Hungry will be responsible for administering medical assistance to returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP reports that the price of staple foods has increased 30% from the same time last year. The increase resulted from the mass repatriations from Zaire and Tanzania, from poor harvests inRwanda and southern Uganda, and from the trade embargo against Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">International Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda (ICTR)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Arusha, Tanzania, the trial of former Interahamwe leader Georges Rutaganda has been postponed until May 27, to enable the court to combine his case with two others. Rutaganda faces charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. The tribunal has indicted 21 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Developments</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Government of the Republic of Burundi (GRB) reported fightingbetween security forces and rebels in Mitonto village, Rumonge commune, Bururi province, on March 27. Official accountsof the death toll differ, with state radio reporting 140 dead, and an army spokesman claiming 57. The army also reported that Hutu rebels killed five people in the Kinhama neighborhood of Bujumbura late Sunday. The victims were reported to be Hutus who had recently returned from refugee camps outside the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two anti-tank mines exploded in Bujumbura on March 25, killing atleast 20 people. One mine detonated as a minibus drove over it. Authorities announced one arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions remain unanswered about the GRB's claim that rebels killed 135 people and wounded 144 in Buganda commune, Cibitoke province, on March 19.  Government authorities reported on March 13 that a plot to kill Buyoya had been foiled. The announcement came several hours after three land mines exploded in different parts of Bujumbura, killing seven people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The GRB recently announced the establishment of regroupment camps in Bujumbura Rurale and Bururi provinces. The practice of regroupment is already being enforced in the provinces of Karuzi, Kayanza, Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Muramvya. Local press reports state that, in practice, military authorities inform Burundians living in particular areas to move to the regroupment sites.  If the peasants do not move to the camps, the military considers them rebels, and they risk being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although conditions in the camps are satisfactory in the beginning, the health of the population is prone to deteriorate from the effects of crowding, inadequate potable water, poor sanitation, lack of medical care, and inaccessibility to farm land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the acceleration of forced displacement of the population has imposed a growing burden on the relief community, imperiling their neutrality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent Food and Agricultural Organization/WFP study found that food security in Burundi has deteriorated. Civil strife, population displacement, and the regional economic embargo have reduced food supplies and increased food prices. It has been noted, however, that it is difficult to separate the economic consequences of civil strife in Burundi from the effect of the embargo. Although the sanctions have exacerbated the difficulties resulting from shortages of food and medicines, shortages existed before the embargo was imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders will meet in Arusha on April 8 to evaluate the effect of the sanctions against Burundi. The leaders will examine the measures taken by the GRB towards establishing democracy, peace, and reconciliation, to determine progress made in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of March 24, there were 361,699 refugees in Tanzania: 273,742 of them Burundian; the rest Zairian, the UNHCR reported. The populations are as follows: Ngara camps: 97,600; Kibondo camps: 103,647. Both areas hold only Burundians. In the Kasulu area: 116,699, including about 44,204 Zairians; Kigoma camps: 43,723 refugees, almost all Zairian.  Tanzanian authorities are reportedly planning to mount a search operation for Zairian refugees who left the Kigoma holding center, and to place them inrefugee camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USG first responded to the crisis in the Great Lakes region with a series of disaster declarations, necessary to begin USG emergency assistance.  U.S. Ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, declared the first disaster in the region on November 7, 1996, noting that the refugee crisis in Eastern Zaire posed a humanitarian emergency for Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Ambassador to Zaire, Daniel Simpson, followed on November 12, citing the violent breakup of refugee camps in Eastern Zaire. On November 25, U.S.  Ambassador to Burundi, Morris Hughes, determined that Burundi's continuing civil strife warranted USG assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to the stated needs, BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda from October 26, 1996 to February 26, 1997, and an assessment team to Zaire from February 12-26, 1997. The current USAID/DART was deployed to Nairobi on March 14 and is working in the region. The USG pledged $140 million in humanitarian assistance to the region on November 18, 1996. The USAID/DART has installed an information officer in Nairobi and established afield office in Goma. This week, the Department of State Bureauof Population, Refugees, and Migration approved a $3 million contribution to UNHCR to assist in repatriating refugees from Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEBRE ZEIT - Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, Ato Tefera Walwa yesterday underscored the significant contribution the national defence force made in ensuring peace and stability of the main economic growth the nation registered over the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Tefera made the remark at a panel discussion he held with the staff of the Ethiopian Air Force on their second day of observance of the Air force's first annual day celebrations. The panel was organized to brief the Air-force staff on the socio-economic conditions of the country and the governments five-year peace, democracy and development programme as well as to discuss what role the defence force in general is expected to play in the former, according to organisers of the panel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Tefera told the gathering that comparing the country's overall picture prior to the coming of the EPRDF with present trends, the nation as a whole could be said to have achieved a rapid, double digit economic growth the attainment of which, had been a direct result of the closer and democratic working relationships between the people and the government. &quot;The army's contribution has been particularly conspicuous in protecting the development process from anti-development elements&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The spirit of democratic cooperation and trust demonstrated by the people and government of the FDRE which brought about all this success over the past few years is exemplary and the general staff of the Air-Force and their officers and commanders should continue to develop closer, democratic relationships so as to continue to achieve the remarkable results they are already registering in their services to the country and the people,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expounding at length about the significant economic growth the country has achieved, Ato Tefera said that the economy grew by a hefty 10.4 per cent which demonstrated that &quot;we have proved a rapid, sustainable development.&quot; He noted that unlike the past, the country has now reached a point where no such thing as budget deficits are observed. &quot;In fact we are in surplus and efforts are being made to turn the budget surplus to other development expenditures,&quot; he added</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing that the country has reached a stage of food self sufficiency and has surplus production of grains which could be exported, Ato Tefera indicated that the inflation rate also stands either at zero or negative, and in short that it is only normal. One era where he talked of problems was concerning balance in imports and exports, which problem he attributed to the country's reliance on only agricultural products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual day celebration will continue today and ceremonies to be conducted include exhibitions and graduation ceremonies for pilots and technicians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - More often than not the Australian batsmen have managed to blunt South Africa's pace attack, but our leading batsmen have proved more brittle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The St George's Park wicket is not one that the South African team will look back on with anything other than suspicion. The uncompromising strip has not treated them well in the last two outings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In analysing the Test and one-day international defeats it must be noted that on both occasions the Australians have for the most part batted better and bowled better on a track that has been vilified by the critics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It rests on the premise that the St George's Park wicket was specially prepared for the South Africans. This may well be true and as valid as the Indians adding an extra something for their particular brand of cricket at home when we toured there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if this is so when Port Elizabeth comes under the microscope, there must be a number of questions asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First and foremost, if the strip was left green for the Test to give the South African pacemen an extra yard and that added bounce to unsettle an Australian batting line-up that had savaged them unmercifally in the opening Test at the Wanderers, what happened?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, the Australian seam attack, limited as it was to just two men in Glenn McGrath and Jason Gillespie, bowled far better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Australians rely on a wicket-to-wicket approach that is the basic vehicle for a fast bowler as the founding factor of his craft. It makes the opposing batsmen play shots, it keeps him under pressure and -perhaps psychologically more than physically -gives the bowler the feeling that he is a predator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a philosophy which can perhaps be monitored by long-term students of the game back to the days of the Vale of Hambledon and cricket's very beginnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But certainly, the leg-side theory employed by England's Douglas Jardine to shackle the magnificence of Don Bradman in the days before his deserved knighthood, was a lesson that the Australians have never forgotten. Attack is burnt into the very soul of every Aussie schoolkid who picks up a ball and decides to fling it at another youngster in short pants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men like Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Merv Hughes, Craig McDermott, McGrath and Gillespie might well be great guys to share a Fosters with after the action is over, but on the field the milk of human kindness is stowed for the duration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that Allan Donald, Brett Schultz, Shaun Pollock or Lance Klusener are shrinking violets. But examine the amount of catches Dave Richardson has taken in his career at top flight and weigh that against the number of times our bowlers knock over the stumps, and the thought expands somewhat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, despite what poacher-turned-gamekeeper Kepler Wessels would have you believe now he has become a critic, all was not doom and despondency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donald delivered spells of quite staggering aggressive bowling in the final Test at Centurion Park and the opening one-day match at East London. Finally, you thought, the greatness of our top bowler. Sadly it did not last through to Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet the telling factor there was the bowling of 28-year-old Adam Dale in only his second appearance for Australia. Clearly, he has been schooled in a different way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our inability to consistently break through the Australian batting -with the exception of the sadly out of form captain Mark Taylor -is a worrying factor. It emphasised the importance of those three superb run-outs at Buffalo Park in the context of what really won that game. It also raised the question of why Rudi Bryson, who honed his talents in Port Elizabeth, was not given a run on the track where he must know every blade of grass -mowed or unmowed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally, if our brittle batting started to come good in the opening one-day encounter at East London, where the six-wicket victory gave us the head-start we so patently lacked in the five-dayers, why did it fall apart so badly on the grass of St George's?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To analyse this is almost impossible. There are no easy answers to this country's batting problems. There are no quick fixes. Had Louis Koen not fallen to a tragic first-baller, perhaps the basis of a more defendable target than 220 would have been possible. Koen will be back. He is too good a player for that blemish to mar his career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once again that top-end failure factors out superb innings of 82 from Jacques Kallis, an exciting and extremely valuable 57 off the bat of Jonty Rhodes, a gritty 31-run display from skipper Hansie Cronje, and the 27 from Klusener at the tail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kallis is a comer, a batsman who will do great things in the seasons to come. Rhodes, depite the reluctance of the selectors to risk him at Test level, remains a batsman who breaks the rhythm of a fielding side so often and so successfully that he is worth far more in real terms then the runs he posts for his country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cronje also deserves better from the critics than he is currently getting for he shoulders not only his own batting burden, but that of all who fall around him. Of Klusener, it must be said that he is still learning his trade and doing not a bad job of it. What he needs now is some consistency in his performances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it remains true that at the top end, we just do not have the potential partnerships that any combination of the Waugh twins Mark and Steve, Greg Blewett ad Stuart Law always threaten to produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again, on the available surface, they simply batted better. It is something worth remembering as the series continues its way to conclusion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Fifty years ago Jackie Robinson kept a date with destiny to defy the bigots. Pat Putnam celebrates the historic day when a major talent stepped up to bring baseball's race barriers tumbling down</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT has been a Lincolnian two score and 10 years since the time when sport was an all-white domain in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the close of that era, when Jackie Robinson, a black baseball player, woke up in the home of his mother-in-law on Christmas morning of 1946, he was still officially listed on the roster of the Montreal Royals, a minor-league club. Until Robinson, no man of colour had ever played on a white team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a full season with the Royals, he had seen Southern ballparks padlocked to keep him out, had hotel doors slammed in his face, had endured the hate hurled at him by endless parades of racists. By that Christmas Day, Robinson knew his destiny. He knew that by the time the snows thawed and vanished in Brooklyn, he would be promoted to the Dodgers, on to a national stage where desegregation, especially in so hallowed a Caucasian stronghold, was an unspeakable act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be another two years before President Harry Truman would order the desegregation of the armed forces. Seven years would pass before the US Supreme Court would mandate equal public schools for black students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Brooklyn, Robinson's patron, Dodger owner Branch Rickey, was making every effort to ensure that destiny would not be trifled with, and not until five days before the 1947 season opened did he announce that the Dodgers had purchased the contract of Jack Roosevelt Robinson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rickey had feared that premature disclosure of his plan might doom his grand design. Since the 1890s, baseball executives such as commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis had strictly policed the colour line, barring blacks from both major and minor leagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before signing Robinson, Rickey had said to him: &quot;This is not a hasty decision. I'm doing it because I can't face my God much longer knowing that His black creatures are held separate ... from His white creatures in a game that has given me all I can call my own. Not only will you be on trial, but all of black society. You must be a man big enough to bear the cross of martyrdom. You must not fight back. You must turn the other cheek. Can you do it, Jack Robinson?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robinson nodded and whispered: &quot;I can do it, Mr Rickey.&quot; Then in a stronger voice, he said: &quot;I'll turn the other cheek for as long as it is necessary.  But when it is no longer necessary, I will be my own man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only then, at last, the player played, with some of his own team-mates expressing open hatred, and others in the National League threatening to strike. But when Robinson stepped in against Boston's Johnny Sain at Brooklyn's Ebbets Field on April 15 1947, tapping a grounder to third base, something was advanced in the US that could never be rewound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackie Robinson became the most exciting player ever to step between the lines. Not the best hitter, not the finest fielder, not the best in stealing bases, although his accomplishments are legendary. He was simply just the most exciting. He gathered baseball's highest honours: Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, first-ballot election to the Hall of Fame. Born in 1919, he died in 1972, from complications of diabetes, but fatally weakened, they say, by the immense pressures he heroically endured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How long ago it seems now, almost quaint, especially in a land where the majority were not even born when Robinson became a Dodger, and where history is so thinly taught that not even Jackie Robinson can be assumed to be a household name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a speech 10 years ago, Peter Ueberroth, then the commissioner of baseball, felt compelled to recall Robinson, lest he become &quot;a forgotten moment&quot;. And just recently, acting commissioner Bud Selig said that Robinson's debut &quot;was baseball's proudest moment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then Selig and every major-league franchise owner and every major- league player were conspicuously absent after being invited to participate in a nationally televised &quot;town meeting&quot; moderated by ABC's Ted Koppel that sought to measure racial progress in sport since Robinson broke the colour barrier 50 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Baseball left it to Clifford Alexander, a consultant on minority hiring, to represent the sport's executives. &quot;It pains me to have a black lawyer to answer questions that should be addressed to white owners,&quot; Koppel said. &quot; It's not a disgrace to be coloured,&quot; said Bert Williams, a famous turn-of-the- century comedian, &quot;but it is just so inconvenient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Rickey's family implored him to back off from his plan to bring Robinson into the National League, he refused, instead commending them to Alexander Pope's Essay on Man, notably this part: &quot;We first endure, then pity, then embrace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, 50 years later, when the man Robinson is dead, when his plaque is in the Hall of Fame, when the Smithsonian will present a lecture series on Robinson, when the US Mint will produce a gold coin with Robinson's likeness on one side and an etching of him sliding home on the other, when a 60-second video of Robinson stealing bases will be shown in every ballpark, when baseball dedicates this season to Robinson and every player and umpire will wear &quot;Breaking Barriers&quot; arm patches, when Bill Cosby will host a $1-million fund-raiser for the Jack Robinson Foundation, there is still much inconvenience around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Celebrations and anniversaries are important for reasons other than reminiscing about the past,&quot; said Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow. &quot;It's elieve he would say we have not come far enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n opportunity to look at where we are today with some of the issues Jack's entrance into baseball raised. The residue of racism is still out there. The struggle is still going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked what she thought of the state of the game today, Mrs Robinson said, &quot;Jackie was very impatient for change and rightfully so. Trouble when top doesn't top score</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most certainly not as far as the third stage of Pope's continuum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Falilat Ogunkoya's bronze medal at the Olympics inspired her Nigerian teammates to their best performance ever, and now she's aiming even higher</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN Falilat Ogunkoya, in South Africa at the moment for the Engen Grand Prix series, returned home last year to Lagos with the most successful Nigerian team in Olympic history she was f ted just as much as long jump gold medallist Chioma Ajunwa and the victorious soccer team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian media dubbed her bronze medal in the 400m as &quot;the golden bronze&quot; because she was the one who broke the drought and opened the flood gates, becoming the first Nigerian athlete ever to win an individual medal and the first Nigerian woman as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the end of the Games she had also become the first African woman to win two medals at the Games with her silver in the 4x400m relay -although here in South Africa Penny Heyns might dispute the Nigerian definition of an African woman!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogunkoya was a national hero and she was rewarded with a house from her state governor, land by the ocean from the governor of Lagos and money from the Abacha regime. &quot;When I won that bronze it made everybody in the Nigerian team believe they could win,&quot; says Ogunkoya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact it gave her childhood friend, Mary Onyali, the motivation to go and win one of her own. &quot;Mary told me that when she saw me win the bronze she thought to herself, 'Woah, I started out with Fali. She's just won the bronze.  Damn, I'm going to get one of my own.' That meant a lot to me because we've been running together since 1984 and we went to the world junior championships together in 1986.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Atlanta she didn't feature in many people's medal predictions despite showing all the right signs. The reason for her relative anonymity was that she had only been competing for two years since a self-imposed five- year lay off and she had not yet made a name for herself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogunkoya exploded on to the world stage when she won the 200m at the 1986 world junior championships in Athens as an 18-year-old. That earned her a scholarship in America at Mississippi State University where she progressed under coach Bob Kitchens, winning two sprint silvers at the 1987 All Africa Games as well as gold in both the relays and reaching the quarter finals of the 1988 Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1989 Kitchens decided to try her out in the 400m and in her first race in the South East Conference meet she broke the African record with a time of 51.65, lowering it twice more to 51.22 before the end of the season and winning bronze at the 1989 World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although her future looked bright as a 400m runner she didn't have to don shades to take away the glare. There were storm clouds aplenty gathering in her sport and in May 1990 at the age of 22 she threw in the towel. &quot;After my Conference meet in 1990 that was it. I just stopped. I got tired of everybody using drugs,&quot; says Ogunkoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a tough call to make for such a talented athlete but as a strict Muslim who doesn't even drink, the blatant abuse going on around her became too much. &quot;Everybody was doing it and even back home in Nigeria people were talking about this one and that one using drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Then in 1992 a bunch of people got caught and people asked me how do I feel about it and I said I don't feel anything because I've already stopped running,&quot; says Ogunkoya. Two of those caught in the lead-up to the Barcelona Olympics were Chioma Ajunwa and Charity Opara who both won medals in Atlanta after serving four-year suspensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992 after finishing her studies Ogunkoya decided to have a baby and after her son was born in 1993 she started to jog to get fit and lose weight.  In 1994 she moved to Albuquerque with her husband Tony Osheku -an 800m runner who holds the Nigerian mile record -and it was then that he started to pester her into making a comeback.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tony talked me into coming back because he thought I could be a very good quarter-miler. He knew I broke the African record after doing it for only one year and he believed I could be better,&quot; says Ogunkoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a five-year break, a return to the top flight was no stroll in the park. &quot;Hell it was painful. It was like somebody beat me up with a baseball bat but he was right there encouraging me and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't have made it. It is not easy coming back after a long lay-off,&quot; says Ogunkoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She managed a couple of runs in Europe in 1994 but never went below 53 seconds and went back to Albuquerque to put in a hard winter in preparation for the 1995 world championships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was hungry and I told myself I've got nothing to lose. I started doing long runs of around 45 minutes on mountain trails with Tony and that gave me a lot of strength. When I went to Houston in March and ran a 51 I knew I was back and after reaching the final at the world championships (she was sixth) I knew 1996 would be a good year for me after all I'd been through,&quot; says Ogunkoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was right. Three races under 50 seconds in the lead-up to Atlanta convinced her she had a shot at a medal and it was those runs in the forests of New Mexico that took her to that historic bronze medal in a new African record of 49.10. &quot;I didn't have a good start but I came through very fast in the last 150m and that was because of my strength,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogunkoya, along with Australia's 400m silver medallist Cathy Freeman and local star Adri de Jongh who is aiming for her first sub-50 seconds run, is part of the most exciting field for any of the track events in the series.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And although she has not set the South African tracks on fire Ogunkoya is very happy with her form so far. &quot;I only started training in January and I had one indoor race in Tokyo before racing in South Africa. I'm really pleased with where I am right now because my focus is on Athens and I must be in shape by June so that I'm ready for the Nigerian trials.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With four world-class quarter-milers in Nigeria it will not be a formality for Ogunkoya to make the Nigerian team but with the invincible French gold medallist Marie-Jose Perec to aim for she has bigger challenges ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nobody is out of reach. Not even Perec. You just have to work harder and programme your head right. Atlanta made me realise I can go further in athletics and I certainly aim to improve this year.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - No one in his right mind would believe that Louis Luyt is an easy man to take on in a head-to-head battle. More than one opponent has tried. None have yet succeeded in ousting the man who sits at the administrative helm of the game of rugby in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian van Rooyen, a blocky lock forward and accountant, is the latest to fall before the guns that Luyt has brought to bear, losing his bid to oust King Louis from the presidency of the Transvaal Rugby Union and his vice- presidential seat in the process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Van Rooyen did not, like so many of his predecessors, retire into obscurity to lick his wounds. He continued the fight, in the process spurring Minister of Sport Steve Tshwete into instituting a government inquiry into how the game is run in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt replied by charging Van Rooyen with bringing the game into disrepute, a charge Van Rooyen will have to answer at Ellis Park next Wednesday when he appears before the executive. The outcome, one would suggest, is a foregone conclusion. Van Rooyen will be censured and stripped of whatever official voice he still has left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a move that one would suggest Luyt and the South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu) have not thought through and one that threatens to split the game in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More chilling though is the fact that this split is almost sure to run along racial lines. Van Rooyen comes from a background that never enjoyed the racial privileges of the majority of rugby players and administrators in this country, and he has the backing of another, Errol Tobias, the Springbok three- quarter who broke the all-white mould forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luyt holds the administrative might, but there can be no doubt that in the eyes of the world, Van Rooyen and Tobias hold the moral high ground. Luyt has the disadvantage in this respect of a history of neglecting the feelings of the rest of the world as much as he ignores the internal barbs and arrows aimed in his general direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The social gaffes perpetrated by Luyt are too many to list, but his denigration of Colin Meads during the World Cup as being a &quot;has been&quot; and his references to the size of England coach Jack Rowell's mouth are just two that come to mind. Meads is revered in New Zealand, and trying to chop the venerable Pinetree down, earned Luyt far more enemies than he has probably computed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rowell, while he might not be the epitome of the England establishment, is nevertheless a powerful man, and a slight of the nature offered by Luyt after South Africa had come back from the dead at Loftus Versveld and levelled the two-match series against England at Newlands, will not be forgotten in a hurry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These schisms are on the international front though. What faces us all in this country is a rendering of all the good that was done in bringing a nation so close together during the euphoria of the World Cup triumph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rooyen's insistence that the game's administration become more transparent and that development of the game become more of a priority than anything else, may well prove to have some merit. Certainly, from an outsider's standpoint, both calls have real merit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has to be remembered that rugby is still thought of in many circles as a bastion of the colonial and apartheid eras.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, the picking of a convicted killer in the national side, the axing of Francois Pienaar as Springbok captain and the racial expletives of former national coach Andre Markgraaff have not done anything to change that attitude among the bulk of the citizens of this country. Especially when Pienaar, who left with dignity to ply his trade overseas, was given a send- off by President Nelson Mandela and yet not so much as contacted by the rugby authorities. Pienaar, it will be recalled, dedicated the trophy to every citizen in this country on that tumultuous day in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now both Van Rooyen and Tobias are determined to beard the biggest Gauteng Lion in his den, take on Luyt and get some real sanity back into a game that has, in very general terms, become one man's personal fiefdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For no matter what Luyt has accomplished as an administrator -and these accomplishments are numerous -he has destroyedthem, from a public point of view, by a crassness and insensitivity that often defies belief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Rooyen and Tobias alone cannot change things. The machinery of officialdom is too ponderous and imbedded in the concrete of loaded constitutions for this to happen overnight. But both are equally determined that the next generation of South African rugby players and followers of whatever hue have a right to free access to the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alone they may not succeed, but the machinery of rugby governance will have to change as surely as the computer has taken over from the abacus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One only hopes that Van Rooyen does not have to fully exploit the looming racial issues in a situation that Sarfu have seemingly vastly underestimated to make it happen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - With his experience of African conditions and solidity in defence, Gavin 'Stability Unit' Lane looks the right man for the job in South Africa's vital clash with Congo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GAVIN LANE could complete a fairytale rise to international football this weekend when South Africa play Congo in a crucial qualifying match for the 1998 World Cup finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries share first place in Group 3 with four points each after two rounds and victory for Bafana Bafana in the Atlantic town of Pointe-Noire would tighten their grip on a section that includes Za re and Zambia. Lane, a 30-year-old defender for Orlando Pirates, received his first national call-up last week and if coach Clive Barker opts for a five-man defence, the man they call &quot;Stability Unit&quot; should make his debut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barker used five at the back in the 0-0 away draw with Zambia three months ago. Sizwe Motaung and David Nyathi operated as wingbacks and captain Neil Tovey, Lucas Radebe and Jacob Tshisevhe watched the middle. The absence of suspended Mark Fish opened the door for Tshisevhe from Kaizer Chiefs, who never settled and was replaced midway through the second period by Helman Mkhalele.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At times the central defenders appeared to be getting in the way of each other, but it was a new system for the African champions and Barker will be tempted to persevere with the formation, if not the personnel. This time, Radebe is expected to replace Nyathi on the left with Tovey sweeping behind Fish and Lane, whose defensive partnership played such a crucial role when Pirates lifted the African Champions Cup two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The midfield trio in Zambia -Innocent Buthelezi, Eric Tinkler, John &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu -are likely to be retained although Tinkler and Moshoeu must be aware that they performed well below expectations in Lusaka. Tinkler has hardly played for Italian club Cagliari and long spells on the sideline are obviously hampering his international career, while Turkish-based &quot;Shoes&quot; did not display his customary appetite and often floated on the fringes of the action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buthelezi, whose long-standing dream of playing abroad seems likely to be fulfilled with Birmingham City or Bolton Wanderers in England, lacks match practice after an injury sidelined him for several weeks. Assuming Barker uses two forwards, Jerry Sikhosana is assured of his place again with Brendon Augustine or leading Castle Premiership scorer George Koumantarakis vying for the other spot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Augustine would normally appear the obvious choice as he is quick, skilful and has considerable more international experience than the Manning Rangers forward, but there is the small matter of the Municipal Stadium in Pointe- Noire to consider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the equatorial sun shines, the ground is harder than the N1 highway.  When the rains come, it quickly develops into a swamp. South African surfaces are green paradises by comparison. Given the unfriendly terrain, Bafana Bafana may plump for Route One football with the ball being booted deep into opposition territory where there could be plenty of physical scraps for possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Lane capable of landing throw-ins deep inside the box, the head of 1, 91m Koumantarakis could be an attractive target. Perhaps Augustine will start with &quot;Big George&quot; kept in reserve. While South Africa were expected to be strong challengers to top seeds Zambia and former qualifiers Za re, the rise of the Congolese Red Devils has taken everyone by surprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Ivory Coast have slipped considerably from their lofty position in the mid-1990s, no one expected them to lose 2-0 in Brazzaville and draw 1-1 in Abidjan during the preliminary round. An even bigger surprise awaited Zambia in Pointe-Noire where a late goal settled the match and Congo built on this result by crossing the Congo River to Kinshasa and forcing a 1-1 draw with Za re. Unlike their three rivals, Congo have no household names with Ivory Coast-based goalkeeper Brice Samba probably the best known. Samba lines up with Africa Sports National and defender Florent Baloki with Abidjan rivals ASEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forward Macchembe Youngha-Mouhani scored twice for German Bundesliga club Fortuna Dusseldorf last month while Olivier Niere struck vital goals against the Ivorians and the Zambians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia complained of poor treatment in Central Africa with the hotel food so bad that the visitors were forced to visit restaurants and security at the dilapidated Pointe-Noire stadium was non-existent. These are the weapons which will also be used against Bafana Bafana, a team used to standards far removed from those found on the west coast of central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa have played there before, winning a qualifier for the previous World Cup 1-0 in January 1993, and team manager Glyn Binkin flew to the Congo last week to check on facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bottom line is that Barker and his players must adapt to the local conditions, knowing that if they avoid defeat they will remain on course for a ticket to France while victory would put them firmly in the Group 3 driving seat.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - There is, in the Swedes, the kind of chill aloofness about the way they go about the business of churning out top tennis players that reflects, in many ways, the engineered correctness of their heavy industry.  The thought of flaws and setbacks being anything other than a temporary aberration simply does not exist. It is a character that engendered the icy concentration and incredible skills on both grass and clay of Bjorn Borg, produced the consummated stroke-making of Matts Wilander, and the silky serve- and-volley professionalism of Stefan Edberg. The Swedes are, in short, not to be taken lightly in tennis or any other field of endeavour where ability is welded to the cerebral function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Into this atmosphere, the South Africans enter this weekend, at Vaxjo, north of Stockholm, and a Davis Cup quarter-final against the Swedes for an examination of national character as much as one of South African tennis- playing talent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South Africans have expressed their approval of the medium-fast indoor surface, one more than likely weighted, in the minds of the Swedish federation, to favour the top Swedes Thomas Enqvist, Jonas Bjorkman and Magnus Larsson, but equally suited to the playing styles of Wayne Ferreira and Grant Stafford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here it must be said that the singles -as always -assume the most important aspect of a tie that will line the winners up against Spain or the Italians, who beat us so convincingly in Rome last year in a meeting that most pundits would have had South Africa winning in the ante-post betting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home officials will have selected the surface with a keen eye on the Swedish doubles pairing of Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti and their ability to swing what is more often than not the pivotal match against Ellis Ferreira and debutant David Adams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One would hardly expect them not to. They are, after all, a nation that advertises safety and dependability ahead of performance in automobile advertising; a nation that is not accustomed to taking chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans, on the other hand, rely more on go-faster stripes and mag wheels -the outer accoutrements if you will -to make the motor work at maximum revs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is interesting that this country's top tennis players have come close to shaking off that in-built ideology on an individual basis and made a good deal of impact on the courts worldwide. Collectively though, the philosophy of a smart paint job has often outweighed this week-on-week training in the tough classroom of tournament play and left some lessons still to be fully absorbed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief lesson learnt on the clinging clay in Rome -as was the case in the rain-dampened tie against Austria on the grass at Wanderers that led up to the trip to Italy -was that home court advantage counts for a great deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matching the surface to the demands of the local players is nothing new.  And the Swedes, who once ruled a goodly slice of Europe, will not be unmindful of the effects of history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not a series of matches that this country's non-playing captain Danie Visser and his squad can take as being just another outing, no matter how the pre-tie hullabaloo has tended to hype it this way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We were treated to the same confidence before the Austrian tie. That ended up a close one after Thomas Muster won his first ever encounter on grass and then the rain forced a switch to the indoor surface at the Standard Bank Arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same happened before the journey to the Foro Italico in Rome and Wayne Ferreira's heroics with feet that bled into his socks. It was a supreme effort from this country's number one and the personal criticism he received in the aftermath was both crass and undeserved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What it all boils down to is that every nation is capable of its own surprises. The Swedes are no different, no matter Stafford's sparkling current form as he shoots up the ATP rankings, or Ferreira's career record against the best Sweden can offer in the singles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It must be remembered that Borg, idolised as the darling of Wimbledon, was an eminently better clay court player than he was on grass, that Wilander abandoned his career to write music and poetry, and that Edberg preferred to live in London, a country that offered little in the way of tax relief over the Swedish revenue collection system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are all examples of the type of quirks that have to be factored into the equation when you take on a nation away from home in a town where the road and shop signs are unintelligible to the average Anglo-Saxon, the crowds are fully behind the home side and the surface has been carefully selected to give the hosts the edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite simply, there may be an aloof quality about the way the Swedes are engineered, but there is something else as well, as Wilander -a native of Vaxjo -showed, there is a poetry hidden in their souls that shows when they pick up a tennis racquet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now, everyone knows the book deals with Slovo's communist party/African National Congress activist parents Joe (born Yossel Mashel) and Ruth First, a woman who stuck to her own name long before post-war feminists even thought about it. You'll also know that Joe secretly had a son called Michael Sachs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gillian Slovo is surprised at all the fuss the revelation caused in the South African media. Naming him, she said, had nothing to do with the possibility of grabbing headlines and pushing up the sales of the book as has been suggested, &quot;but with the integrity of what I was writing and whether I might be hurting people unnecessarily. In fact I talked to Michael about naming him and if he had said he didn't want it, I possibly would not have done so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite the revealing of this &quot;secret thing&quot;, to evoke the book's title, she says the work is not a family confessional, preferring to call it a family memoir. It's not &quot;splurges and purges of guilt, that's not what I've done. I'm travelling through my past, working out what this country meant to me and how I fit into it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some might say all this territory is well covered in her sister Shawn's film, A World Apart, which concentrates on the period of First's detention in solitary confinement in 1963.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But no, says Slovo, &quot;that was a child's eye-view. This is an adult understanding of a much broader period. I see them as different.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics have weighed in with accusations about a &quot;Slovo industry&quot;, but Gillian is quite clear that she's going back to fiction after this, her first non-fiction work. This book had a dual process -ferreting out what was really happening as well as coming to terms with her passionately committed parents, warts and all. Children of other political exiles from all over the world have written to her in recognition of shared experiences, she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But we have yet to see people like Thabo Mbeki and Zwelakhe Sisulu undertake similar journeys, tell their stories of struggle and exile. They and people like them must have fascinating tales to tell, but thus far the South African exile saga has been confined to white writers. It could be, suggests Gillian, that such people are simply too busy running a country now to ponder on their pasts in literary ways. We can only wait for the autobiographies of Zanu, Frelimo and Umkhonto weSizwe fighters and exiles, but somehow, one suspects it'll be a long wait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before Every Secret Thing, Gillian wrote detective novels and a family saga.  She says she was drawn to detective novels precisely because &quot;they're about the gradual uncovering of secrets&quot;. And she enjoys constructing her own stories and seeing her characters live on the page. She wrote her first book, Morbid Symptoms, when she was unemployed. &quot;I read a lot of detective stories and a friend and I decided we would both try our hands at it. He never finished. I was lucky enough to be published.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After her first three such novels, she started on Ties of Blood, a family saga. &quot;That took me three years and my partner (film-maker Andy Metcalf) provided the money, which paid off in the end and I was able to go into full- time writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's still angry about her mother's death by letter bomb and would like to have responsibility for that act pinned down. Spy Craig Williamson has admitted to her that he was &quot;in the loop&quot;, in other words, in the chain that was responsible for the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How does she feel about the current pressure to name informers allegedly holding high ANC positions? &quot;It's time for truth in this society ... if there were such informers, I'd like them to tell the truth, as with my mother's murder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as she writes in the book, finding resolution is an elusive thing.  After she has interviewed Williamson and listened to the tape of their conversation, she ruminates: &quot;Perhaps this was why Joe hadn't bothered tracking down Ruth's killers: because he had known what I was just discovering -that meeting with them would never provide catharsis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, that is exactly what she is looking for, she intimated in a television documentary on the same subject, Death in the Family, this week.  She does say that the process of discovery has helped her come to terms with her past, but she's discovering that truth is one thing, and reconciliation, terribly, terribly hard.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - MEETINGS WITH REMARKABLE TREES by Thomas Pakenham (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, R195)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEAVING the skirmishes of the Boer War behind him, and the unsightly scramble by colonialists for Africa, award-winning historian Sir Thomas Pakenham has chosen still, silent subjects for his most recent research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings with Remarkable Trees is an unusual and beautiful picture book, which unites 60 of the oldest and most splendid trees in Britain and Ireland in Pakenham's personal gallery of favourites and friends. Pakenham provides a short written and full-page photographic portrait of each tree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In each instance, the tree's significance stems from its age, its stature and its associations. Through the leaves of the book, Pakenham reveals his own character, in his turn of phrase and his comments, made as he sizes up each leafy giant. He even features in some of the photographs, his face peeping out, for example, from behind the boughs of the original Irish Yew at Florence Court, County Fermanagh.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think far many more people than will admit have a special relationship with a tree and I brought this relationship out of the shadows,&quot; he said in an interview in Cape Town last week, justifying his novel approach to tree cataloguing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He puts the splendour of the photography down to his magic camera, which he showed to me during the interview. Through the viewfinder of the Linhof Technika, I was able to study a number of less remarkable trees in the garden where we were talking, on the slopes of Table Mountain. With the black cloth over my head, I was able to block out the schemes and traffic of humanity, and felt that closeness with the subject which Pakenham captures in every portrait.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening his book is like rambling in a friendly forest, far away from ever- restless human beings. Trees, through Pakenham's lens, become the nobler species, stoic for lasting so long in an increasingly violent, selfish man- made world, virtuous for being so beautiful and fruitful, and divine for achieving near-immortality. Of course botanists argue that Pakenham errs by imbuing trees with human capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My botanist friends were outraged,&quot; said Pakenham. &quot;Trees are not centred beings with feelings. But we all attribute feelings to things -it's a kind of fallacy but we all take part in it.&quot; This is one of the reasons why this book will continue to be so popular. Pakenham brings out the pantheist in his reader. In the introduction, he describes how, in anticipation of a great storm, he takes the measurements of 19 beeches on his property, fearing for their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I slipped a tape measure round the smooth, sliver-green, lichen-encrusted bellies of the trees and listed their measurements in a notebook. None was a record-breaker. But all had been good friends for generations to our family.  As I taped each tree, I gave it a hug, as if to say 'good luck tonight'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This encounter started Pakenham off on a quest to identify the best trees in the land, and pay them tribute. &quot;I travelled the length and breadth of Britain and Ireland doing research for this book ... Many of the ancient trees that I saw were suffering from neglect. Fences, put up years ago to protect them from sheep and cattle and horses were often broken. Few historians have troubled themselves much about these monuments. Yet old trees are living documents.&quot; Pakenham marvels at these silent witnesses who have endured centuries of human endeavour. Yew trees, in particular, have caught his imagination. &quot;It's a romantic clich' to find pleasure in ruins, but a living ruin is different. One gets far more pleasure from living ruins because they remain part of life's stream -part of the wheel of life, even the oldest trees can be breeding new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are very good listeners you know, trees are very good listeners -and they can be violent too, they can drop things on your head.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakenham is used to writing about violence -his books on the conflict in the Boer War and the senseless carving up of the African continent, which has caused such suffering among African peoples, distinguished him as a historical writer. When Pakenham talks passionately of the problems of Zaire, his brow becomes knitted, but he talks with an open face about the response he has had to his trees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After writing about the Boer War I got letters from people, saying 'Dear Sir, You failed to name my grandfather in your book and he fought in this or that company and he did a jolly good job and you did not mention him.' But with Meetings with Remarkable Trees, I received more letters that the other two books and there were no letters of complaint. Some of them simply said thank you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Looking over the wonderful verdant garden, Pakenham begins to muse about getting letters from trees, signed with a root-print. &quot;I'd probably get a letter from a tree, saying 'You watch it -this time you've gone too far Pakenham,'&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pakenham is not going to stop with his first book. He is now embarking on a worldwide quest to find remarkable trees to sign up for his next book, a sequel. He was about to set out to the coast when I met him, &quot;to stalk yellowwoods in the Knsyna Forest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these trees photographed in their splendour might remember their moments with Sir Thomas Pakenham, standing gazing at their foliage, remarking upon their fruit and sizing them up from behind the lens. They may store the memory in their trunks as a special one -a meeting with a remarkable man.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A touring photographic exhibition is at last telling the truth about Hitler's reluctant army. And some Germans don't like it, reports STEPHEN PLAICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The honourable German soldier coerced and corrupted by the Nazis has become one of the century's most powerful icons, an everyman for an age mired in moral ambivalence. It has been perpetuated in hundreds of films and novels, from Sam Peckinpah's Cross Of Iron, to Stalingrad, The Desert Fox and even The Great Escape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We all know the scenarios -the decent regular officer looking on helplessly as he witnesses the brutalities of the SS, the humane prison-camp commandant driven over the edge by the Gestapo. The ordinary soldier's dilemma has even been turned into a comic clich': witness the comic-book Krautery of 'Allo, 'Allo -&quot;I vas only obeying orders!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military historians, too, have been anxious to put distance between the activities of the Wehrmacht and those of Hitler's Praetorian guard. This division of culpability is a reassuring myth that both the victorious Allies and the defeated Germans have found convenient. Now an exhibition, The War of Annihilation: Crimes of the Wehrmacht 1941-44, has completely shattered that image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition has been touring German cities for nearly two years, and the evidence has been snowballing all the time, as more ex-servicemen and their families contribute letters and photos hidden for half a century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that it has reached Munich in the conservative heartland of Bavaria, the exhibition has sparked a huge political row that has already spilled on to the streets in violent demonstrations and arrests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition charges the Wehrmacht with major war crimes, and it is difficult to see how they can be denied. Shocking photographs from the Eastern Front show the mass execution of Jews, gypsies, prisoners of war and so-called partisans by soldiers from regular units. They leave no doubt about the zeal and enthusiasm with which the army pursued systematic extermination in Serbia, Russia and the Ukraine, with hardly a Gestapo car or an SS insignia in sight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the main thrust of the evidence is that it nails the lie that ordinary Germans knew nothing of the Holocaust. The letters on display, written mostly by low-ranking soldiers to their families and girlfriends, prove public knowledge and tacit support for the slaughter of the enemies of the Reich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tone is often missionary. The soldiers write of the need to rid the world of &quot;subhumanity&quot;, of putting the Jews out of their &quot;wretched misery&quot;, of a &quot;sanitisation programme&quot; for the white race, to which the English and Americans are &quot;traitors&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Wehrmacht's High Command seems to have done little to control the flow of this casual information. It's clear from these letters that many of the soldiers revelled in their gruesome work. As one soldier chattily puts it in 1942 after going on a sightseeing tour of concentration camps around Auschwitz: &quot;It really is good to get out and see the world ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the official photographers in the &quot;partisan&quot; war in Serbia, Gerhard Gronefeld, has contributed to the exhibition. He was with the army when it conducted executions at Pancevo, near Belgrade. Gronefeld, who subsequently became a nature photographer for Life magazine, kept his photographs of Wehrmacht firing squads buried in his garden in case the Russians discovered them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While admitting army complicity in the slaughter, Germany's defence ministry still resists wholesale condemnation of its wartime troops. The official line is that the bulk of the blame lies with Nazi agencies, particularly the SD, the ruthless security service of the SS. The army has always made much of the resistance of a small group of its officers, which culminated in the unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944. Hitler himself regarded the army as the &quot;second pillar&quot; of the Reich, after the Party. These pictures make it much more difficult for army apologists to claim it was merely coerced into helping him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what is also disturbing about these revelations is the apparent cover- up in the immediate post-war period. The compilers of the exhibition found army records had been systematically weeded of incriminating material. Some regimental files may well have been destroyed during the bombing, but it is hard to believe that the Wehrmacht had time to destroy all the incriminating evidence during the collapse of the Reich. Was there Allied complicity in the cover-up?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Allies had good reason to exempt the Wehrmacht and its officers from the war trials. In the same way that the judiciary, clergy and medical profession were not taken to task about their involvement in National Socialism in case the infrastructure of the country fell apart, so the integrity of the army needed to be preserved. &quot;Denazification&quot; was token at best. It was this period that spawned the image of the &quot;honourable&quot; German soldier compromised by evil Nazis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Erfurt the exhibition panels were sprayed with the word &quot;lies&quot;. In Regensburg the mayor boycotted the opening because the image it gives of the Wehrmacht &quot;does not appeal to me&quot;. But the critics have been unable to challenge the authenticity of the photographs and letters. And so the attacks have become personal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conservative Bavarians may not want to remember the war or the Holocaust.  But since the exhibition opened in February they have been prepared to take to the streets and cenotaphs for the honour of Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After instructions by the defence ministry to counteract the negative image of the German army, the centre-right leader in Munich, Peter Gauweiler, boycotted the show's opening ceremony and held his own ceremony of remembrance at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. His ceremony was well attended and some carried white roses, symbol of the resistance movement during the Third Reich.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the exhibition's organisers and their hosts, the Social Democratic city council, German honour now means coming clean -exposing the full horror of the atrocities perpetrated by previous generations. But Mayor Christian Ude and his colleagues expected trouble. No posters were put up for fear of defacement, and the opening ceremony had to be moved at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, Ude was the star of the show, earning enthusiastic applause.  He insisted the exhibition was not a blanket condemnation of the Wehrmacht, nor an attempt to undermine the modern army. But he pulled no punches. His generation should not feel morally superior, he said. They should count themselves lucky they never had to face the stark choice of their fathers and grandfathers -serve in a totalitarian state or be eliminated themselves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This week's launch of the National Arts Council was a modest and charmed affair. An uncharacteristically warm speech from Lionel Mtshali, Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology was matched only by a highly impressive spread of snacks to greet the disappointingly few guests that pitched up. (So impressive were the snacks that the caterers were to be seen beforehand taking snapshots of their work). But upstaging both the minister and the catering was the minister's bodyguard, whose identity and photograph have been witheld in the interests of national security. The dishy attendant was decked out in a beautifully cut, ethnic-styled suit and it is without reservation that we name him the Best Dressed Bodyguard of the Year.  Who knows, with the film and TV foundation to be established next, he may just find himself in the right place at the right time to make it on to the big screen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coming soon to a stage near you</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A DOZEN or so phone calls this week revealed that South Africa is fast becoming a standard stop on the world concert circuit, with most major tours finding it financially viable to pop by here between Australia and South America.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some of the names listed here are confirmed, most are just rumours.  Promoters don't like to confirm these things before a contract is signed because sometimes acts are poached by rival promoters at the last minute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here are some of the acts being bandied about for South African appearance in 1997: Australian rock funkers INXS (see Michael Hutchence, right) have been confirmed for May/June; UK dance unit Faithless are confirmed for the end of this month; Bryan Adams is stopping off on his world tour; U2 seem set for an October gig; Michael Jackson is on again after being off again and then on again for the end the year; Depeche Mode have expressed interest in another visit; Joan Collins is rumoured to be considering a stage appearance; Luther Vandross , if anyone wants him; Simply Red's Mick Hucknall slips into town periodically and is considering another tour; some say Van Morrison and Hootie and the Blowfish are looking likely, while Celine Dion is one of the popular rumours. And we might see a reformed and re-made up Kiss as a stopover in their world tour. There's also a rumour drag supremo Dame Edna Everidge will be popping by for a chat and a cup of tea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wine tasters beware</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPEAKING of cocktail parties, a report from France this week should cause suitable alarm for all those wine connoisseurs out there. Medical specialists claim that wine is extremely bad for ones teeth and gums. They used as an example the case of an Italian wine merchant whose job involves him having to taste upward of 40 wines a day: his gums have eroded and all but six of his teeth have fallen out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - JUDITH WATT awards Design of the Week to Boss Models' extravagant one-off publication Society Africa and looks at Cape Town's emerging model market which is set to conquer the world's catwalks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOCIETY AFRICA is the latest drive by Boss Models Worldwide to establish itself in the consciousness of South Africa's fashion infrastructure. Already the most glamorous agency in the country, it is setting out, with the chutzpah only a foreign national can have in a country not its own, to give Cape Town the most public possible fashion baptism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Society Africa, a 1x1,5m glossy magazine, will be sent to 3 000 &quot;media and fashion industry decision makers throughout Europe and the United States&quot;, alerting them to the beauty of Cape Town, currently dubbed &quot;the New Miami&quot; by fashion internationals who seasonally swoop down on the Mother City to shoot editorials and advertising campaigns for overseas clients.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of Boss Models Worldwide David Bosman (39) is shrewd, timing the launch of Society Africa to follow a very successful season. In Cape Town, overseeing the final stages of Society Africa, he is loving every moment of being here. The British son of a Nigerian father and an English mother and resident of New York, he owns one of the two black-owned model agencies in the country, which immediately makes Boss Models very sexy (the fact that the industry is very white in terms of ownership is beginning to cause a much- deserved scandal).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former photographer and model, he started his agency -Boss Models -in New York in 1988, riding the crest of the supermodel wave, opening branches in London and Miami. Models were reaching icon status, paid $10 000 to get out of bed, fought over by top designers who recognised their vital importance in branding a collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The raw power of Campbell, Schiffer, Evangelista and Crawford was eclipsing the stars from Hollywood and they were becoming role models to the millions of aspirant teenagers who'd just outgrown Barbie and wanted something real that combined beauty and sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was time for men to become sexual icons too, not only for the ever- hungry gay public but also for the &quot;women in powerful positions who have become important consumers&quot;, says Bosman. So he published the Boss Male Supermodels book, which raised his male models, at that time paid less, to almost the same Olympian status as the female supermodels. Certainly it went a long way in giving equality of pay to male models (male models at Boss are the highest paid in the world) but it also was the perfect PR and marketing move for the relatively new agency, at that time tiny beside monsters like Elite and Ford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kids think models have dropped from heaven,&quot; he says, giving one of his reasons for publishing it. &quot;Models have become role models for the youth and I wanted to give a series of images for each model to show their lifestyles and history. In that way, they became more real. Modelling was no longer just a silent movie.&quot; It also cleverly captured a new generation of wannabe models who presumably would approach Boss Models before the others. Which may be one of the purposes of Society Africa, as Bosman and his team continue to trawl the country for new talent to add to their 900-strong international stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boss Models opened late last year in Cape Town; 70% of the models are South African, the rest are internationals (the limit set by the government is 15).  Since then, the agency has landed top editorial jobs with international titles Arena, Esquire, GQ, Marie Claire, Amica, and with South African Elle, Elle Man, Cosmopolitan, Fair Lady, Femina and Sarie. It has also worked exhaustively with the local ad industry. According to Bosman, this first season was phenomenal, with Boss Models bringing in foreign clients like The Face, Vogue and Emporio Armani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Using local kids is so cool. There's an endless pool of talent and I'm taking seven kids back with me at the end of April. They are so beautiful I suspect we will see huge superstars from South Africa,&quot; eulogises Bosman. As males, Christian Bernard, Nathan Roberts and Andrew Goodman can look forward to starting work at around $5 000 a day and rocketing up to a superstar rate of $25 000 for a day's work. &quot;When you think of the billions of dollars certain designers make, and the energy the models put out on their behalf, I believe that the compensation should be relevant,&quot; he argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what is it that South African models have got? Great looks. &quot;It's the environment&quot; says Bosman, comparing it with Miami. &quot;They're sporty, they live an outdoor life, they've got the genes. It's a great place to bring up kids and this comes out in their physique, whether black or white.&quot; Two of Bosman's favourite locals are black, Louise and Diana, whom he describes as &quot; beautiful&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And this is where Boss is really important to the local industry: it provides a means of getting into the fashion industry of Europe and the US, where they can make it big time. &quot;It's difficult to travel from here and it's difficult financially,&quot; continues Bosman. &quot;With us, they can move within the company, we can advance them living expenses. We see it as exporting South African talent. And if you really put your soul into it and get on with it, it'll work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Bon Models' Dahli Shezi won the Boss Models-Edgars Club Fashion Model of the Year and has worked well at Boss in London where she is in demand for her &quot;black-Oriental&quot; look. &quot;They must try and work internationally&quot; says Bon Models' Yvette Nolan. &quot;Here, the industry is too small and clients complain of a model's over-exposure. Surely the whole purpose of being a supermodel is over-exposure!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, the one-off limited edition Society Africa, currently being printed in the United Kingdom and set to launch in late May, will cause a wailing and tearing of hair throughout the land. It's just the sort of thing the local industry should have got together back in 1992 when the market friendly &quot;Rainbow Nation&quot; was born and South Africa became the world's favourite nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently, former model and agency owner, Nakedi Ribane -now on the Ebony team -sent a proposal to the minister of arts, culture, science and technology requesting government help in establishing the modelling industry and making it accessible to potential black models and agency owners: &quot;It's now time for black boys and girls to have a niche in the industry as owners and bookers, as well as being models. And once there are role models up there, more and more will want to join the industry,&quot; she says, calling the local industry &quot;lily white&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not successful. The South African government is the only one in the world to bring in legislation to control the influx of foreign models pursuing their nomadic career. Perhaps they think that is enough and leave it to foreign investors to build the industry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the above, Bosman makes a parallel with the British government -the only government in Europe that does not subsidise its fashion industry. &quot;They have brilliant designers, but they all leave the country.  Look at Galliano and McQueen. In South Africa, the government should subsidise the designers, the ones coming out of college and the more established names. In that way they'll keep the ship afloat, create an infrastructure that really requires the modelling industry. And if they don't, people will continue to demand foreign labels and the models will continue to struggle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bosman and his team have used only local models with Cosmopolitan's Malcolm Kluk as creative director, but it was Italian photographer Calvin French who was asked to shoot the entire publication in and around Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following international designers are included in a stellar array of labels: Gucci, Prada, Dolce &amp; Gabbana; Armani, Romeo Gigli, Yves St Laurent and Joseph. Local designers include Errol Arendz and members of the Young Designers Emporium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the models have something African about them, but by using Calvin French (who shot the Armani campaign) we bring European flair. It's a clear statement about the beauty of Africa and the beauty of its people. And that's what we want the world to see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fashion is still treated pretty much as lightweight entertainment by most social and cultural commentators in South Africa. Regarded as frivolous in the framework of recent political and cultural trauma, perhaps it is now time to re-evaluate the fifth largest industry in the country. As the market continues to expand, with Cape Town becoming a major player in terms of international editorial, more and more of our youth are going to see modelling as a serious career option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boss Models' first successful season proves that South Africa is a dynamic and economically viable market for overseas clients. Let's hope that Society Africa creates the kind of energy that local agencies can and will pick up on and use intelligently.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The new Decca diva is American soprano Renee Fleming. Two years ago she was a last-minute replacement for Georg Solti's live recording of Cosi fan tutte. So enthusiastic was the critical reception that Decca immediately signed her as an exclusive artist. That spurred a publicity campaign last launched to place mezzo Cecilia Bartoli on the musical map.  Like the Bartoli blitz, the Fleming promoters seek to capitalise on her good looks, with cascading red blond hair prominent on most CD covers and publicity stills.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how good is Fleming really? Perhaps the shortest description of her voice is that it is like Kiri Te Kanawa's but with character. The outstanding characteristic of Fleming's voice is its creamy evenness in all registers, although there are already signs that her high register may not much longer suit roles like Susanna in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro. Indeed, on her disc of Mozart arias with the Orchestra of St Luke's conducted by Sir Charles Mackerras, she sounds far too matronly for Mozart's pert maid. Her characterization of Fiordiligi for Solti's Cosi is, for all the silky smoothness of tone, also perhaps just a touch too staid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But here is a formidable Countess in Figaro in the making, even if she does not intend recording that role as yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like her Decca co-star Te Kanawa, Fleming is equally at home in Mozart and Richard Strauss. Last year I heard her as the Marschallin in Der Rosenkavalier under Christoph Eschenbach's direction, a poignant and carefully thought through performance that I will long remember. A recording of this production will be issued shortly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, her reading of this composer's Vier letzte Lieder recalls great interpreters like Gundula Janowitz (with Karajan on DG). Fleming is alive to every nuance of these moving songs, observing exquisite pianissimos and not afraid to indulge in the odd tasteful portamento.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And like Janowitz, it is only natural that she should turn to Schubert lieder. Accompanied by Eschenbach on the piano, her most recent disc offers a wide-ranging collection of mainly well-known Schubert repertoire. Anyone wanting evocative but perfectly judged performances of favourites such as Heidenroslein, Die Forelle and Gretchen am Spinrade should buy this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Want her in different repertoire? She can also be heard in Massenet's Herodiade and Rossini's Armida for Decca, and Donizetti's Rosmonda d'Inghilterra for Opera Rara.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Whether for his trippy screen savers or portraits of peace, Bangalore artist Venkataraman Balu has been dubbed the master of the collage medium. He's not simply absorbed in creating beautiful art, but in focusing on a global mission for peace through art.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Art is a wonderful way to communicate the essence of peace,'' says the artist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began his imaginative artistic peace mission in 1982 and has showcased work from his World Peace through Collage Art exhibition in New York, Belgium, London, Paris, Berlin and now in South Africa. The exhibition includes portraits of spiritual leaders, Mahatma Gandhi, Sai Baba and Hindu deities like Ganesh, because Balu believes art is the way to the divine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Balu collects scraps of wastepaper, and with scissors and glue he creates abstract impressions of peace and sometimes singular images of inspiring pacifists. &quot;People think of collage as being made up of bits and pieces but in my collages I use bits and pieces to make a total, holistic composition.  And my medium is the best and most aesthetic way of recycling paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Venkataraman Balu will give a slide presentation at the Hindu Seva Samaj Centre in Cape Town on Sunday April 6</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - This year's Rustlers Valley Easter Festival became a battle between the ravers and the hippies, reports SUZYBELL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A WOODPECKER screeched as 900 Gemini twins howled at the half-eaten moon.  Yup, the rave scene has infiltrated this once laid-back hippie pastoral happening -Rustlers Easter festival. &quot;It's just thud, thud, thud, thud,'' moaned the hippies. &quot;The record is surely stuck,'' brayed another, as she lolled about on a grass mat sipping chai (tea) and waving around a fat joint as if she could direct the show.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Have you signed the petition yet ... to legalise it. Did you know the stuff is indigenous? It's a renewable source -non-toxic fabric, paper, oil, fuel, medicine -inspiration, holy sacrament ... fully.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Hoffman butted in, suggesting a trip to Goa with a choice of Durban DJ Jessica and her pet white rat or special guest Micky (Israel, Japan, Goa) at the SpinOut tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the way a scrap of a man in faded apricot shawl with a battered silver kettle chanted in a weak voice: &quot;Chai-chai''. Hippies drank loads of chai by the fire, but it wasn't long before the question was asked: &quot;What's in this chai?&quot; Unsuspecting souls asked: &quot;Can chai really give you a buzz?'' Yep.  It's natural stuff. Herbs are potent, man. So you don't have to take straight amino acid in a clear bottle or concern yourself whether it's safe to snack a yellow and purple tablet that has no writing on it, because if you aren't into rave you aren't into hardcore drugs. So sip that chai, sister, and enjoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, the hippies are restless. But are they willing to cut their hair, swop their crystals for chemicals and sell their hippie happiness for shimmering yet seductive self-destruction? The subcultures seep into one another, unconsciously. Nevertheless, hippies are spraying their dreads for luminous evening glam and ravers sit with hippies to chill out, whether spiralling up or getting stoned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Hare Krishna devotee with a trendy number-one cut confided in me that he had hardly slept all weekend. And it had nothing to do with tripping on the serenity of Krishna consciousness or yogi tea, more because of the &quot;very disturbing vibrations'' in the dusk-until-way-past-dawn music. The hippies, too, were not at all happy that they could not sleep, never mind sleep in.  Because this year didgeridoos have been replaced with hardcore house and techno thumping its way through their tie-dyed dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while this year's layout may have been intimate for some, it was hellish for others. Previous years saw the techno tent about 2km away from the main stage and the surrounding 4 500 campers. The Hells Angels kept a sublime silence on the subject. But they left early. Perhaps it was the rain, the mud, and the very madness of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Cut your hair off man, it's liberating. It'll reconstruct the fabric in your soul,'' burped a freshly shaven baldy. &quot;When you cut your hair, you cut away the sadness of your past. It's all stuck in your hair, man.'' But surrealism crept in as those with white eyes and shining faces attended early morning drumming workshops and Tai Chi classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were cleansing ritual saunas after sunset, fireside jams at midnight beneath the willow trees and all-night tribal gatherings in the tipi circle with sangomas from the Nkukumuhi ancestral valley. Perhaps this is what it was originally all about. The philosophy anyway -the Starseed generation. If only those who were manically swopping Xmen for Sunshines knew of the magnificent aromatherapy massages and healing hands so nearby. If only the five-year-old boy selling &quot;oil balloons&quot; in pretty pink Durex boxes knew of the Earth Warriors' kiddies' adventures at the Greenfield activity site. But then again he was on a vital social awareness mission of his own, however unconscious it was.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many ways the festival was less flamboyant this year. Not a performance artist in sight. No delicious Queen of Tarts, no risqu' body-painting. Even the Emithini tent, as terrific as it is as an enormous T-shirt tent, was nothing more than a terrific tent. Last year it bristled inside; this year it was a flop. The Lodge was closed, the loos were unisex (for minimal environmental impact) and the line-up of music for the main stage was not all that enticing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exciting sounds came from three hot Cape Town bands -Nine, No ID and Asazi.  Just Jinger (Johannesburg) were strangely popular with their tame Christmas carols. So where were the Springbok Nude Girls, Squeal and the wondrous Wonderboom boys? And how come the faceless belly dancers at the Comet Cafe had to dance in the dark? And will rave take over, as the hippies fear? Or will hippies cross over and &quot;become the dance''? Will the ravers of today become burned out, seeking solace in gentler pursuits? Perhaps some will hike somewhere into the amphitheatre of the breathtakingly beautiful Maluti mountains which, alone, are worth my five-hour journey from Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it's just that eco-festivities whether rastas, ravers, hippies or Hells Angels, are in short supply. Consciousness is still very unconscious, and it's still very much one big mindless mother of a party. And Rustlers Easter Festival is not simply &quot;a fairy freaky farm to frolic in the hills with trancy attitudes and easy vibes''. It's certainly that, but it's slowly becoming much, much more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Equinox Spring Celebration is held at Rustlers Valley in September.  Other festivals and workshops include: E-Scapade, Shamanic Journey, Beyond Massage and Permaculture. Tel: (05192) 3939 for details</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Last time Tom Jones was in town, Soweto was simmering and it was uncool to play SA. Maria McCLOY looks back at the tours of that time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A GOLD Rolls Royce and women throwing their panties at him -that's what Adele Lucas, who worked publicity for Southern Sun at the time, remembers of Tom Jones's 1976 South African tour. Someone else recalls a tight white jumpsuit that rode so high anyone wearing it &quot;would have had to wear a sock to create any semblance of manhood&quot;. Hey, hairy chests and gold chains were all the rage back then.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two decades later and Tom's back, surprisingly down to earth, reclining in a luxury hotel suite in Johannesburg. Whether it's because people still like his music or because nowadays cheesy equals cool, his fans are still swooning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After something of a lull, singing over Art of Noise's remix of Prince's Kiss got him back in the top 40 and on to MTV. He's done The Simpsons, Tim Burton used his tunes in Edward Scissorhands and cast him to play himself in Mars Attacks! -the man must have something going on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though he hasn't got a clue about any South African music, he knows more about current artists than most 56-year-olds. New jack swing innovator Teddy Riley and U2's producer were involved in his last album The Lead and How to Swing It.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1976 is the year most South Africans associate with the student uprisings, but as it turns out stars as varied as Tina Turner, Ray Charles and Engelbert Humperdinck visited sunny SA around about that time and a bit later. They performed at the Colosseum and the Empire in Jo'burg before doing Durban or Cape Town. Jones is quick to point out that he would not have come here if his audiences weren't mixed and that back home he avoided a British Musicians Union ban by showing press-clippings illustrating that his audiences were apparently multi-racial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back then, rude shows were a bit of a no-no (after all, Cliff Richard's gospel shows were a firm favourite). According to publicist David Wilson, Ms Millie Jackson certainly showed everyone a thing or two when she got dragged off stage by police, who regarded her act as &quot;blasphemous vulgarity.&quot; He reckons she knew what to expect in South Africa so decided to have some fun.  He remembers her saying things like,&quot;Hey you in the front row, how often d'ya do it?&quot; She also composed a song especially for the censors: a charming ditty comprising a series of &quot;fucks&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Performing Arts Workers Equity's Dan Robbertse says the boycott and blacklisting system (administrated by the United Nations (UN) special committee on apartheid) was more succesful in terms of limiting cultural and educational TV and film material, but it was &quot;difficult to police people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1976 Jones's three black backing singers had trouble finding a hotel until authorities granted them &quot;honorary white status&quot;. To him, SA's separatism was &quot;a government thing&quot;. He refers to his mixed audiences in SA, but not many others who were present remember the audience being overtly multi-racial -especially considering people couldn't even go to the movies together until the late 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1984, Divine -who his manager Bernard Jay says was not a drag queen but &quot; character actor; sometime disco star&quot; was invited to the country to perform at the opening of Jo'burg nightclub Zips. They agreed to come as long as they got air tickets, a holiday and a racially mixed club staff and audience. He says they knew about apartheid and that Divine was outspoken about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years later, on tour in Copenhagen, the hall Divine was to perform in was stinkbombed and they were met by people protesting his SA performance.  They got a UN letter telling them they would be blacklisted unless they justified their actions. The UN accepted their explanation that it was not a paid performance, that they did not get work permits and that the audience was mixed. And if this had not been the case? &quot;I think the threat was they would recommend Divine was not given a work permit to play in other countries in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically many of the artists who did come here when it was politically uncool were black: Isaac Hayes, The Temptations, The Main Ingredient,The Seekers and Chick Correa. Singer Lovelace Watkins had it better than Sidney Poitier, who came to film Zulu. Poitier had to stay on a farm out of town because there was no accommodation for black people. Watkins was guest of honour at a women's group banquet, and the Sunday Express's picture of him dancing with a white woman nearly lost the hotel its licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, American boxer John Tate's romp with blonde beauty Mercedes Cornfeld resulted in him being threatened with deportation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the mid-Eighties' tightening of the boycott and worldwide coverage of apartheid resulted in a dearth of tours. It must have been a question of which artists chose to know what was up. Lucas says some artists expected lions in the street (one wonders, then, what the hell they understood of the political situation), in contrast to people like Quincey Jones who was &quot;well aware of the apartheid thing ... he wouldn't put a foot here&quot;. Unlike Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan, Bill Hailey, Chubby Checker, Richard Claydermann, Max Bygraves, Percy Sledge and Suzie Quatro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harsher penalties for artists performing here didn't stop George Benson, Cher, Queen, Frank Sinatra, Gloria Gaynor, Rod Stewart, Barry Manilow and Elton John from performing at Sun City -oh, I forgot, Sun City wasn't in South Africa. Like Robbertse says, an artist's conscience ultimately determined whether they came to SA or not.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SWAPNA PRABHAKARAN speaks to Calvin Hunt about the upcoming visit to South Africa of the famous Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre Company</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CALVIN HUNT does not stay in any one place for very long. As the general manager of the renowned Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre Company, his job is to travel ahead to various countries, like a missionary spreading the word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think of myself as a citizen of the world. I'm not a tourist. When I travel I get to meet the people of every country I go to, I get to work with them and get to know them a little bit. I bring the joy of the company everywhere I go.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a tall man, soft-spoken, with bags under his eyes and jet lag tugging at his face. The Ailey company is coming to South Africa in June, and for two days Hunt has had a whirlwind tour of dance venues in Pretoria, Johannesburg and Soweto, meeting his South African counterparts in contemporary dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carrying a camera and a profound sense of pride in the company's artistry, Hunt says his job is to spread the spirit of communication through dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1958 Alvin Ailey began the company for a small group of young black modern dancers to find cultural self-expression. Since then the company has grown to include a dance school to train black American youth and maintains a huge repertoire of diverse forms of dance, from tap and yoga to West African and ballet. Though Ailey himself died in 1989, his spirited belief in the uniqueness of minority dance in America lives on. Ailey once said: &quot;The dance came from the people. It should always be given back to the people.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa the company will hold intensive workshops and lecture- demonstrations for three weeks, for people in the city and the townships.  Hunt says this is an integral part of what the Ailey company stands for. &quot;I didn't have any idea of what to expect of South Africa. I saw the townships, the rows and rows of shanties and I learnt that people built up these dance communities in such conditions. I was impressed that no matter what the surroundings, there seem to be people here seeking to dance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dancers from the Ailey company will take part in the arts outreach programme and go into the Soweto dance schools to share and teach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company isn't a role model, exactly, but rather an example of what is possible in dance. All of this is one man's dream. What we're saying is that people do not have to make a set judgment about the way they dance or the way they see themselves. People who don't dance ballet don't have to be excluded from dance. They don't have to put on a tutu.&quot; Hunt shakes his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have encountered prejudice everywhere I go. There are people everywhere who don't like black people, or don't like the way we dance. Even in New York city, the mecca of dance, there's this understanding that only ballet is 'real dance' and the rest of us aren't real. People don't mind paying money to watch ballet, because it's considered 'high art'. But we are fighting the establishment. Our popularity everywhere says to people: 'Come and see - there're many ways to express through dance, and you'll probably enjoy our way more!'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a scorn for any kind of dance that doesn't get people emotionally involved. While the entertainment value of all Ailey pieces is high, there isn't a single piece that doesn't express some kind of emotion or tackle a form of storytelling about the struggles of a minority. Hunt says unashamedly: &quot;All of dance is art, and you should enjoy art and be able to relate to it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the biggest thrill for him is to watch prejudiced people discover that they, too, can identify with the experiences of joy, sorrow, laughter and pain that the Ailey company dances about. &quot;These people are often converted after an Ailey performance. They bring their families and friends in to see us. That's a complete victory. I look at them and see that the company made them laugh and made them cry. We made them sing the songs and try out the steps ... After a performance of the Alvin Ailey company, you are not the same. The dances identify us all as human beings. And human existence is the same everywhere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">--The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre company will be in South Africa in June. They will perform at the Civic Theatre in Johannesburg from Thursday June 19 to Sunday 29</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An overweight twentysomething turned around and asked whether I would mind if he &quot;killed the fucking kaffir with the beer can&quot;.  This was moments before cans were thrown at Miriam Makeba during the now infamous concert at the Klein Karoo Arts Festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ton Vosloo, managing director of Nasionale Pers, the main sponsor of the festival, tried to play down the racist connotations of the incident by saying: &quot;There is a wonderful spirit of inclusion for the sake of Afrikaans in Oudtshoorn and anyone wishing to attend next year will experience this. We regret the fact that a minority tried to spoil a beautiful attempt to keep Afrikaans as broad as possible .&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makeba, however, seemed unconvinced, and said that although she may attend the festival in future she is reluctant to perform there ever again. This reaction could dent Vosloo's dream of broadening the artistic appeal of Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another black artist who had to bear the brunt of racist slurs was comedian Johnny Campher. Although, as an artist, Campher will probably never reach Makeba's heights, what happened to him is certainly no less significant.  During his show Lag 'n Slag (Laugh a While), three burly men with several empty beer cans decorating their table shouted at Campher to &quot;fuck off from stage otherwise the beer cans will start raining.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called him a &quot;bloody Hotnot who could never be funny&quot;. The festival organisers didn't hear of the incident because it was not reported, but it was clearly inspired by racist attitudes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vosloo, however, remains convinced that Afrikaners over a broad spectrum could accommodate people of all backgrounds at the festival. He was not asked to answer why a black friend who shared bathroom facilities at a camping site outside Oudtshoorn was nearly removed from his shower because, as one man put it,&quot;he is always dirty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My friend will never return to the festival and he feels Vosloo should take note of this. He was not the only black person who felt this way. The premier of Mpumalanga, Mathews Phosa, was due to appear to discuss his Afrikaans book, Deur die Oog van 'n Naald (Through the Eye of a Needle). According to Phosa's editor at Tafelberg, Riana Scheepers, he decided not to attend as a gesture of support for Makeba.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dror Eyal found himself between racists and radicals at this year's controversial Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'KAFFIRS wil alles oorneem; kyk hoe lank speel hulle!&quot; (Blacks want to take over everything; look how long they play!) screams a man to my right. Short brown hair, clean shaven, T-shirt, shorts, Metlife Kaktus op die Vlaktes stick-on tattoo on his cheek. &quot;Waar's die Springbok Nude Girls? Hierdie is kaffir musiek. (Where are the Springbok Nude Girls? This is kaffir music.)&quot; comes from three sweetly dressed teenage girls behind me. Minutes later, beer cans start flying towards the stage. The first one narrowly misses one of the backing singers. As the second one flies through the air, people start catching on to the night's main event: beer-can tossing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before long Miriam Makeba is dodging missiles while people around me start screaming, &quot;Kyk daai hoere! (Look at those whores!)&quot; at Makeba's dancers.  Others, visibly disillusioned with a culture they don't understand, chant for the Nude Girls, Battery 9 -anything young, male and white.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite being reported as having been the work of no more than eight people by festival director Pieter Fourie, the truth is that the majority of the crowd did not relate to the African sounds, and disapproved vocally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elsewhere on the field, a young coloured girl bursts into tears: &quot;Stop it!  Leave her alone!&quot; There are still two songs left on the playlist when the speakers go silent. Makeba's voice floats across the field, exhorting the crowd to wake up and realise that &quot;this is the new South Africa&quot;; that change is necessary. She asks them to stop throwing cans, warning that they might hurt someone. She stresses reconciliation and a large part of the audience claps and cheers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, a large man rushes past security and grabs the microphone.  He starts singing. It's an obscene ditty about a man who likes little boys.  He is midway through the song when security manages to haul him off stage.  The crowd stares in amazement, but it's just another cultural interlude at the Kaktus concert, where anything might happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Started in the spirit of reconciliation, the Kaktus op die Vlaktes concert turned out to be one of the most controversial events at this year's Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees (KKK). The crowds waited patiently while The Jazz Hounds, Mynie Grov', Worsie Visser and Jack Hammer did their thing. They even bopped along to Valiant Swart's infectious rock. But when Amanda Strydom started singing &quot;Amandla ... &quot; they showed their displeasure by throwing beer cans at the stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were many problems at this year's festival. Some were the result of bad organisation. Others highlighted the growing difference between the prejudices we think we have overcome and those that actually have been overcome. If the KKK is any indication, we haven't achieved much. Is this &quot; die nuwe Suid Afrika&quot;? If so, why is there such limited Afrikaans culture being represented at the KKK? Not Afrikaner culture, but Afrikaans the language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why is the festival so white? There were very few coloured productions on offer. What happened to the Afrikaans-speaking coloured community? This so- called &quot;Afrikaans&quot; festival in the Karoo is an Afrikaner festival, not an Afrikaans festival. Supposedly put together to preserve die taal (the language) it seems rather to be preserving white Afrikaner culture. The only nation being represented at the Klein Karoo is the Afrikaner nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A couple of decades difference in time and a few cultural differences, the old Afrikaner culture and the new may not be that different. If you thought of the former as a Voortrekker mumbling to himself and of the latter as a VCR with only one tape, you may not be that far off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's not just all about beer cans. Something else was evident at this year's festival: a subversive element is slowly slipping in. The aesthetic of several artists poked fun at the crumbling edifice of Afrikaner culture - subverting the images, distorting the holy icons and braaing the sacred cows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such group of artists are Bitterkomix' Anton Kannemeyer and Conrad Botes, whose satire of Afrikaner culture has earned them a place in the hearts and pockets of Afrikaans and English youth. This year's festival saw the launch of their seventh issue, with its caricature of the South African condition taken to pornographic extremes. Krismis, Bloedrivier, sexual cravings for black women, the homosexual tension in government schools and other psychoses are pushed to the limit as these two artists manipulate their pens as satirical weapons against the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not content with merely writing about the sacred cows, underground author Theunis Engelbrecht and his Naaimasjiene stepped onto the Kaktus stage to an audience of passed-out boere and a scattering of young alternatiewe Afrikaners up past their bedtime. Having only recently been unbanned in their former incarnation as Randy Rambo en die Roughriders, Die Naaimasjiene used this opportunity to rant and rave to the masses about the joys of blasting the farm and lambasted such cultural institutions as Jong Dames Dinamiek established under National Party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd stared as Die Naaimasjiene simulated sex acts and got down to some heavy rock. The crowd stared as Die Naaimasjiene broke down cultural taboos and barriers. The crowd stared and wondered where their parents were.  The parents slept. Things may have been changed on a national scale, but out here on the periphery time moves a bit more slowly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving slowly through Oudtshoorn was another outfit out to mock the old order. The No Parking group perform street theatre that informs and questions, unmasks and satirises. With no monetary gain in sight, these boerepunques are out to challenge the system. Why? &quot;Because&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resonating to the times they live in and dressed in shabby out-of-date clothes, No Parking wandered through the overcrowded street wearing masks and carrying a sign bearing the legend &quot;Regte Boere gooi Lion (Real boers throw Lion (a brand of beer))&quot;, the other side claiming &quot;Gentlemen throw Castle (a brand of beer)&quot; and the question &quot;Wat gooi jy? (What are you throwing?)&quot;.  Why? &quot;Because it takes a real man to throw beer cans, out of the anonymity of a crowd ... at a 67-year-old lady,&quot; comes the reply. Some people applaud, some people throw cans, and some take photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another group using visual theatre to shatter myths was the Dutch-based Dogtroep, who transgressed and trivialised the dichotomies between male and female; power and death; cannibalism and humanity. Not content with merely changing perceptions on one level, Dogtroep's workshop challenged the whole concept of a particular language, performing its entire piece without uttering a single word. They shrieked, whispered, cried and raged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Daar sal 'n skip kom vol moffies uit Holleland meet jou terrein laat niemand toe sonder 'n invitation hou vroue en kinners weg. (A ship full of faggots will come from Hole land and measure your territory and let no one enter without an invitation and keep women and children out.)&quot; proclaims a work by Garth Erasmus. A red &quot;Afrikaner&quot; is stamped on to the foreheads of some of Liz Hugo's portraits. These artists' exhibitions at the festival could not have been more appropriate, coming at a time when questions are being asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The comments book at the door of the gallery holds the answer. It's a child's exercise book with a couple of ruled lines. But between the lines are the words and thoughts of the hundreds of people who these artists have touched, people who have come to the cultural event of the Afrikaner nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ek bid vir julle. (I pray for you.),&quot; writes KJ. &quot;Sies julle. (Shame on you.)&quot; reads Piet Pienaar's comment. &quot;Nie kuns nie. (Not art.)&quot; &quot;Morsig.  (Messy.)&quot; &quot;Vulgar! Brrr! Kuns?&quot; asks Ms Naud' from Bloemfontein. James Small wonders &quot;Kuns of politiek? (Art or politics?)&quot;. &quot;Vieslik, Godslasterlik, walglik! (Terrible, blasphemous, disgusting!)&quot; says Mr Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what does it all mean? It means that kultuur doesn't come in a yoghurt; it means that the revolution is progressing slowly; it means that there are some provocateurs out there doing damage; it means that we will be back next year.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After months of expectation, this week saw the launch of the National Arts Council (NAC) -an independent statutory board established to allocate funding for the arts. Even though the NAC Bill has yet to be passed by Cabinet, the official NAC lift-off was announced by the Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology, Dr Lionel Mtshali, at a cocktail party on Tuesday this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simultaneously, the names of the NAC executive committee were announced, with the Market Theatre's John Kani being elected as chairman. Christopher Seabrooke (theatre producer) was named as his deputy while Vanessa Cooke (theatre administrator), Lisa Combrinck (literature) and Musa Xulu (music) were put forward as members of the NAC executive committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a delicious irony in the fact that the launch of the most important post-apartheid cultural institution took place in the offices of an organisation created by the old apartheid regime, namely the Foundation for the Creative Arts (FCA) in Newtown, Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Created by then president FW de Klerk in the wake of the Schutte Commission culture proposals during the mid-Eighties, the FCA was established to provide funds for arts organisations excluded from government subsidies. But it was instantly discredited by cultural activists as being little more that the covert intelligence and propoganda wing of the cultural old-guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early Nineties the National Arts Initiative was created to lobby for a national arts council. In its wake, the Arts and Cultural Task Group (Actag) took over as advocates for the establishment of such a council to provide funds for organisations marginalised during apartheid. Spearheaded by the Actag process, the government's White Paper on arts and culture was released in May 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday the NAC was finally launched -literally on the rubble of the FCA.  It is the first statutory cultural body to be established in accordance with the principles laid down in the White Paper. The launch of other bodies such as the National Heritage Council and the South African Film and Television foundation will follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are providing both continuity and innovation,&quot; said Mtshali in his address at the NAC launch. &quot;Today also serves as a concrete example of what can be achieved in a democracy when the arts community and government co- operate in establishing policies and structures which the art community has itself called for.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And for which it has waited way too long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NAC is the logical outcome of the struggles that were waged in the 1970s and 1980s to take control of our lives and develop our culture. We are finally reaping the fruits,&quot; says Kani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAC councillors will serve on an honorary, non-salaried basis for a three- year term and will be eligible for reappointment after a further three years.  While the council will meet a few times during the year to arbitrate and channel funds, it will establish a secretariat and a salaried CEO. The secretariat will be entrusted with the process of setting up advisory panels from different creative disciplines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the public interviews held with 33 nominees for the council -of which 18 were finally chosen -Judge Albie Sachs, who presided over the hearings, asked of Kani: &quot;With all the hats you wear, is your head big enough to hold them all?&quot; (Kani is currently chairman of the Pact Board and managing director of the Market Theatre). The reply was vintage Kani: &quot;Yes, but my heart is even bigger.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, it seems, are his aspirations as chairperson. Although his role will primarily be that of figurehead, Kani will be presiding over a diverse set of conflicting constituencies. But he doesn't foresee any potential cracks in the edifice. Rather, he perceives the differences as dynamic departure points.  And, although the specific criteria for funding deserving projects have yet to be formulated, Kani is pretty buoyant about the council's role as cultural construction worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are able to really see -not simply look -at the South African situation, you will remain in touch with the needs on the ground,&quot; he says. &quot; The NAC will focus on targeting marginalised, needy cultural organisations, in the rural areas, for example. Even though we will be starting off with a paltry sum for allocation to deserving cultural projects, we will not simply be an art bank. We will also serve as an advisory body, assisting arts organisations in getting funds, lobbying in the corridors of government for additional funds and prowling corporate foyers to persuade the private sector to participate in the development of our culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But most importantly,&quot; he adds, &quot;the NAC must set itself up as a role model for our youth, laying the moral groundwork for the future. We can't achieve everything at once.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Joe Slovo once said: &quot;Let us build the first house, for God's sake.'&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Newspapers in Africa are having an easier time breaking out of traditional print media onto the Internet than they do breaking out of traditional roles as lackeys of dictatorial governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonetheless, the two liberations often go hand in hand, and many of Africa's online newspapers and magazines display a feisty spirit that is as refreshing as the opportunity to get more direct access to general African news than the mainstream media are able to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This column covers only the best of the web presences, but a more extensive listing, which also includes publications from Angola, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria and Tunisia, is available through the online version of this column at htp://www.mg.co.za/mg/pc/ pcrevie1.htm</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Kagiso Educational Television (KET) is a new production company that promises to make an impact on educational viewing this year through innovative ventures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Headed by dynamic duo Leora Rajak and Coco Cachalia, the production company has clinched a deal to produce a 13-part television series called Educator Express for the SABC and the national Department of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company snapped up the tender, beating hundreds of independent producers vying for the commission. In less than three months after establishing the production house, which is backed by Mail &amp; Guardian Television and Kagiso Trust Investment Company, Rajak and Cachalia have succeeded in completing the series of 28-minute programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers can catch the first programme of Educator Express on April 6 at 9.  30am on SABC1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be broadcast weekly on Sunday mornings on SABC1, with a repeat at 3pm on Thursday on SABC2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme seeks to offer information which is relevant to the education sector, build morale and offer skills and ideas to help teachers, adult and early childhood educators with common problems they experience in the classroom and more broadly with education policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rajak and Cachalia each contribute skills which complement each other. The former has experience in television production and the latter in education circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What sets us apart,&quot; says Rajak, &quot;is that we are a company that is dedicated to producing high quality educational programming. Education and social development are as much of a priority for us as making good television.  We want the two to go hand in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are moving away from bland instructionist educational television and aim to offer alternative and interesting views.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cachalia agrees: &quot;Educator Express is a major challenge. Not only do we have to reach out to the community of educators but we also need to hold their attention so that we can a provide a 'home' where each week they will get information that will help them in their professional lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concentrating on the commonality of educators, the company deliberately chose an ordinary teacher from Tembisa as the host on the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, they felt, makes the programme more rooted in the concerns of teachers across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The series is also &quot;deliberately not studio-based&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from this programme, KETis also currently producing a number of other programmes:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A 13-part series for SABC 1 which will explore diversity amongst children by using two puppets. Various cultures will be explored and the show will often take the form of a cross-country roadshow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Two educational videos on termination of pregnancy for the Department of Health and the Planned Parenthood Association of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A video on the office of the public protector, who he is and how he can help the ordinary citizen to better access the services of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A set of videos on the new Labour Relations Act for a trade union training organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that well-developed educational footage can go a long way towards social development,&quot; says Cachalia</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although KET's projects are challenging and breaking new ground, funds remain a problem. &quot;We sometimes find that our creativity is being curbed because of budget constraints. The challenge is to show that television can be a great educational tool, especially in South Africa where it can be used to reach large numbers of students in both formal and non- formal learning environments,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KET has developed strong partnerships with the Swedish Embassy, the Commonwealth Secretariat and key government departments and has managed to get most of its projects off the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisers have welcomed the injection of creativity into the SABC's educational programming but caution that this is a niche audience with a limited potential to market goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Discount on schoolwear is the first thing that springs to mind when one thinks about educational television but hopefully this mindset will change with producers bringing more lively educational material onto our screens,&quot; said one advertiser.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - TV programmes are being rescheduled in an attempt to win back advertisers and viewers, report Gillian Farquhar and Jacquie Golding- Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IN an effort to increase advertising revenue and attract viewers, the SABC's three TV channels are rescheduling prime- time programmes, dropping most magazine productions and introducing &quot;more entertainment-driven&quot; television like game shows and foreign sitcoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new schedules are in line with viewers' needs as reflected by recent market research, argues the SABC, but insiders are adamant that the changes being implemented by the public broadcaster undermines its public service mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One SABC staffer said local content is being chopped in favour of foreign programmes which &quot;although cheaper will erode the public service mandate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, independent producers are upset that their documentaries are being put on hold in favour of imported material when, they say, it was understood that the SABC was endeavouring to fulfil a public mandate which included upping educational content, local dramas and magazine programmes as well as local documentaries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now being forced to watch 10-minute arbitrary inserts ranging from improved policing in Britain to the country's automobile associations,&quot; said one staffer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the new programme schedules will please viewers remains to be seen.  Meanwhile channel heads in charge of programme reshuffling are adamant that attempts will be made to retain the educational mandate of the broadcaster.  However, they concede that to keep their heads above water, attempts have to be made to give the public what it wants, namely entertainment value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marcel Jackson, the programme manager for rescheduling on SABC1, says the main changes are an increase in the use of foreign-produced material, the repositioning of local talk shows to later time slots and the axing of some magazine programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Viewing time between 6pm and 11pm will be affected,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest change mooted so far on SABC1 is the dropping of local magazine programme, Hlab'ukhangele, on Monday between 7pm and 7.30pm, Indwe/Sekunjalo on Wednesday at 7pm to 7.30pm and Amagugu/ Emagugu on Sundays at 6pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC1's move towards using more foreign- produced dramas will see a foreign mini- series being reintroduced on Wednesday and Thursday at 9pm, says Jackson. On Sundays, a new magazine programme yet to be titled will be broadcast from 6pm to 7pm. This new programme promises to have a format along the lines of Top Billing and will probably be broadcast in English, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With most magazine programmes previously produced in-house, the SABC has decided to have more of its magazine programmes commissioned to outside production houses. This is in a bid to cut costs in line with the report drafted by the US consultancy, Mckinsey. Recommendations by Mckinsey included firing 1400 staffers and saving R450-million. Local dramas currently showing will be retained, Jackson said. Another move towards upping entertainment value on SABC1 is the introduction of a double movie feature on Saturday night to run from 9pm to 10.30pm and from 10.30pm to midnight. Currently the channel runs only one Saturday night movie feature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local talk shows would also be retained but repositioned to run from 10pm onwards. The quantity of viewing time given to news and sport will not change, and the two-and-a- half hours of children's programmes weekly will also remain unchanged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jackson said that while the move towards using more foreign-produced TV films &quot;bodes badly for the development of the local TV film industry&quot;, it was necessary as this was one area where substantial cost-cutting could be achieved. He also suggested that the use of local content would go up in about two years, or once the SABC was financially on its feet again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC2 seems to have fewer changes in the pipeline. A spokesman for the channel said the biggest change at this stage would be the shift of the news from 9.30pm to 9pm and the rescheduling of current affairs programmes from 9.  30pm onwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The channel is considering &quot;revamping&quot; some of the magazine programmes, although it was not yet decided which ones would be subject to change. All local talk shows and dramas will continue until the end of their current contracts and thereafter at least some will be replaced by foreign productions. Another area where there might be cuts is educational programming, but that would depend on the SABC receiving a bigger grant from the Education Ministry, the spokesman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC3 would be implementing the same overall strategy, but no radical changes are afoot and core prime time up to 9pm would be unchanged, according to Hannelie Bekker, acting SABC3 programme buyer and rescheduler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant changes were the shift of Business Tonight from the 10pm to 10.30pm time slot and the current affairs/actuality programmes from 9.  30pm to 10pm slots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most prominent current affairs programme to shift is Q&amp;A: The Nation in Conversation on Tuesdays, which also gets a new presenter, as Tim Modise takes over from Max du Preez.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other shifts include a new sports discussion programme - On The Edge - which starts this month and Point Blank with Patricia Glyn on Wednesdays. &quot; This would extend the entertainment viewing time by half an hour, which caters for viewer needs and should also attract more advertising,&quot; Bekker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall, the proportion of local programming from 6pm to11pm will drop on average from 40% and 45% to 20% and 25% across all three channels. This, say insiders, is proof that the SABC is slowing moving away from its mandate as outlined by the Independent Broadcasting Authority in its Triple Inquiry Report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Discontent is also brewing among black staffers who argue that Nguni languages are being sidelined in favour of English.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Radio Jacaranda on 94 to 96 FM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OH, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune when one asks for radio schedules...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Write about Radio Jacaranda,&quot; said the editor. A phone call to the station to ask for a schedule (so that one may be selective in advance) resulted in a strange conversation: &quot;Ja-a, I can send you a schedule, but what's it for?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To write a radio column for the Mail &amp; Guardian.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh, but our station manager Willem (Engelbrecht) has to approve every article before it's printed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No, that's not how it works. Radio is a broadcast medium in the public domain and one may write whatever one likes about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But what if it's wrong?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Difference of opinion will no doubt lead to an exchange of words but you cannot control what we write. We are, in any event, dealing with opinion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assistant at Radio Jacaranda said she would ask Willem for a schedule and finally ... finally one arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the station uses a mix of English and Afrikaans and plays a lot of music - very, very middle-of-the-road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly one is not in this target market when one starts yearning for Radio 702's Dr Platzhund on barking budgies and SAFM's Will Barnard on barking mad politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Jacaranda is for &quot;listeners who enjoy an oldies-based adult contemporary music format&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the station's favourite music pieces included a lyrical piece of victimhood which went: &quot;Even a bad love is better than no love ... Any kind of love is better than no love at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song is the kind of thing that should be put in a museum so people can marvel that such quaint views were ever held. But each to his own and this radio station clearly has a target audience which goes beyond Tannie Hettie and Oom Koos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 17 transmitters, the station reaches Gauteng, Northern Province, North- West and Mpumalanga. Its ownership is currently in dispute between New Shelf and Naledi Consortium but in the meantime, the SABC carries on ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been living in uncertainty for three years now,&quot; said Engelbrecht.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The sale of the station was announced two years ago and the year before that, the SABC wanted to change things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Despite the upheaval, we've managed to maintain our listenership (around 585000).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So tune into Radio Jacaranda if you enjoy a little bit of chit-chat, not too much news and lots of Golden Oldies. It may not be the station for the nation but it has its own appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- In Your Ear is a new weekly column which will provide a critique of commercial and community radio stations across the country</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Rescheduling has led to a struggle to save programmes, reports Jacquie Golding-Duffy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AN embattled SABC current affairs division is scrambling to salvage some of its programmes in the wake of a shake-up in the department's schedules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers of SABC3 will only have one current affairs slot a week, scheduled for 9.30pm on Thursdays, while viewers of the other two channels are fortunate, for now, not to suffer any cutbacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It emerged this week that SABC3 channel head, Louis Raubenheimer, plans to alternate the channel's only two current affairs programmes: Q&amp;A for 13 weeks, followed by Focus Features for the next season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both programmes implemented by current affairs head, Sarah Crowe, kicked off about three months ago, but low Audience Ratings (ARs), a lack of advertising, the premature departure of Q&amp;A presenter Max du Preez and increasing costs have forced the SABC to take action in line with cost- cutting recommendations by the US consultancy, Mckinsey.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insiders say the thousands of rands spent on the revamped Q&amp;A set do not justify the poor ARs which average at four. A good rating is eight ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe disagrees. &quot;The ratings of Q&amp;A have been exceptionally good,&quot; she says, adding that the revamp costs were minimal, no more than R60 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A executive producer Iza Trengove cautions that the ratings have to be seen in context. SABC3's limited footprint has to be considered, she says, while Du Preez says the programme's scheduled time of 9.30pm is &quot;post prime- time&quot;, which means most viewers have moved on to doing other things during the evening rather than staying glued to the box.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trengove argues that the SABC is moving towards a &quot;seasonal approach&quot;, with Q&amp;A shifting to the Thursday 9.30pm slot and Focus Features taking a back seat until July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But insiders allege that the seasonal approach is a &quot;milder way of implementing cost cutting&quot; - with the axe having swung at SABC3 first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Preez, who initially was planning to leave the Q&amp;A show after its 13- week season ended, was abruptly informed 24 hours before his programme that he must announce the change in time slot as well as his departure. Staffers close to Du Preez have said the unprofessional handling of the schedule change will impact negatively on viewers as the SABC failed, as it has before, to warn viewers well in advance of programme reshuffling. &quot;This exacerbates an already serious problem for viewers ... not being able to find anything on television.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Preez will be concentrating on his baby - The Truth Commission Special Report - which has been pulling in consistently high ratings of eight ARs and more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is claimed by staffers that current affairs programmes, mostly the Focus programmes, are not only failing to deliver audiences but that, overall, programmes &quot;miss the mark&quot;. However, critics of Focus programmes say the independently produced current affairs programmes like the TRC Special Report and Two Way have proved that it is possible to be informative and controversial as well as entertaining - and still attract audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The viewer, it seems, could enjoy a better quality of programme should the SABC make better use of journalists and producers as well as differentiate between staid programming and pretentious studio-based debates which are too short and have no impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Television News editor-in-chief Joe Thloloe, however, argues that current affairs is on track, although he concedes that the division is &quot;not succeeding with our language mandate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dissatisfaction about the lack of indigenous slots for actuality stems from a dilemma facing the SABC as a corporation, says Thloloe. &quot;Lack of finances and advertising has pushed current affairs out of prime-time viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as the SABC makes enough money to carry current affairs programmes, it could be restored to its former prime slots,&quot; says Thloloe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current affairs programme envisaged by SABC chief executive Zwelakhe Sisulu and other seasoned journalists has not been realised, partly due to incompetence and lack of proactiveness on the part of senior management, say some staffers. Others argue that the SABC is a maze with the most uncreative people occupying the upper echelons and those who have concrete contributions at the coalface are either being sidelined or ignored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'More research into audience preferences have to be conducted and the SABC has to attempt to keep in touch with its viewers,&quot; says one Focus producer who refused to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Crowe agrees that research is a vital tool in assessing the needs of viewers, she denies that poor ARs are responsible for the schedule shifts.  &quot;Rescheduling is a decision made by channel heads and has nothing to do with ARs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are fighting a battle with the channel heads to find a dedicated slot for Focus Features, but this remains undecided for now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she adds that current affairs programming is &quot;often shooting in the dark&quot; and programmes cannot be tailored to please everyone's needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Q&amp;A's Tuesday slot is being filled by sports after, it is believed, a deal clinched between chief executive of television Jill Chisholm and sports head, Edward Griffiths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fingers have been pointed at Chisholm who some staffers accuse of being responsible for edging current affairs programmes out of prime-time viewing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Chisholm's response to these accusations is a curt &quot;absolutely not true&quot; , adding that she thought current affairs has been producing some &quot;excellent programmes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe, who replaced Ameen Akhalwaya in September last year, promised, at the time, that the new-look current affairs slots would contain more human interest as well as be more controversial and racy. The new look, which has been sported for three months now, has not only failed to attract audiences but has caused dissension in the ranks of internal SABC staffers operating in the division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black staffers have complained that the revamped division caters for a mostly white audience and is not fulfilling a public service mandate. Nguni- speaking viewers have been sidelined on SABC1 with the scrapping of the Nguni current affairs slot in favour of English. Priority, argue staffers, is being given to English and Afrikaans and current affairs is, therefore, failing to reflect the demographics of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crowe says the SABC &quot;is in flux&quot; with its language policy and the department did not always have the capacity to develop staffers because of financial constraints. &quot;The lack of money has staff implications,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fatal move by current affairs was when it broke up the package of news and current affairs, shifting the current affairs programmes to at least an hour after the news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This move coupled with a weak package for viewers at 9.30pm is dealing a death blow to the state of current affairs and debate,&quot; says one producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Trying to make sense of the failed current affairs facelift is like trying to make sense of the SABC which is an impossible task with its managers, who fail to confer, consult or even effectively communicate with staffers,&quot; says another producer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jean-Claude Buhrer in Bern reports on Swiss banks' efforts to keep a distance from Mobutu and rumours of his hoarded millions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER getting its fingers burnt by the Ferdinand Marcos affair and, even more, by the present controversy about what happened to assets deposited in Swiss banks by the victims of Nazism, the Bern government is keen to avoid further unpleasant surprises that may arise from the actual or imagined fortune that is rumoured to have been stashed away in Switzerland by President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swiss Bankers' Association (SBA), concerned as it is about the degree to which Switzerland's image as a financial centre has been tarnished, is also watching developments closely. It is prepared to co- operate with the authorities in the event of Mobutu's assets being frozen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Mobutu's grip on power weakens, there is intense speculation about the size of the Zairean president's personal fortune. Estimates range from $100- million to more than $15-billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opinions also vary as to just how much of his fortune Mobutu has deposited in Switzerland. The foreign ministry jurist in charge of the case says some people claim Mobutu still has a great deal of money in Switzerland, while others say almost none of it is left.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An SBA spokesman is even more cautious: &quot;We know nothing about the size of the funds concerned. Indeed we have no indication that there are any at all.  We recognise that any well-run financial centre is exposed to this kind of risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it should be remembered that there were similar rumours going round when the communist regime in Romania fell, and that in the end it turned out Ceausescu had no account with any Swiss bank.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most visible aspect of Mobutu's fortune in Switzerland is his luxury 30- room residence in Savigny, above Lausanne, which is thought to be worth $5,5- million. The mansion was built in the Seventies, at a time when Zaire's strong man was made to feel welcome in Bern. According to the local press, Mobutu pays annual rates of $7000 on this house alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until about 1990, he regularly came to relax at his Savigny residence accompanied by a large retinue. But from then on the worsening situation in Zaire prompted the Swiss authorities to keep their distance from a man they no longer regarded as a welcome guest, and he was granted only the occasional visa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August 1996, Bern gave &quot;purely medical&quot; reasons as justification for allowing Mobutu into the country, thus enabling him to have a prostate cancer operation at a Lausanne hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government also took advantage of that occasion to ensure that the debts of about $1,75-million run up by Zairean diplomatic staff in Switzerland, as well as at the United Nations in Geneva, since 1990 would be reimbursed with greater alacrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being criticised for allowing the Zairean president to spend a long convalesence period on the banks of Lake L'man, the Swiss government refused to allow him back into the country once he had left for the C'te-d'Azur on November 4, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With events in Zaire taking an ever more dramatic turn, the Swiss government has been coming under mounting pressure to freeze Mobutu's assets.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Socialist deputy for Basle has urged the Federal Council to &quot;safeguard the rights of the Zairean people, who have been despoiled for years&quot;, while a Genevan deputy has called for &quot;the immediate freezing of the bank accounts of political figures suspected of having grown rich at the expense of their peoples&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swiss government set a precedent on March 24 1986 when it ordered, on preventive grounds, the freezing of the Marcos's assets shortly after the Filipino dictator had been toppled. Since then, the Manila government has been embroiled in an endless court battle with Marcos's heirs in a attempt to lay its hands on the $350- million discovered in various accounts Marcos had opened in Swiss banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So as to prevent a repetition of the Marcos affair, the supervisory body, the Federal Bank Commission, made it compulsory for Swiss banks to identify their clients, and urged them to act with great caution when dealing with foreign politicians, and above all heads of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, stiffer legislation was also introduced to prevent money laundering. And an agreement now requires banks to act &quot;with all due diligence&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government sources argue that Switzerland is now better equipped to deal with this kind of situation than it was at the time of Marcos's fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a foreign ministry spokesman, the Swiss government can decide to freeze Mobutu's fortune immediately by virtue of the powers it enjoys under the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Another black empowerment deal emerged this week when black- controlled LA Retail Stores announced it had bought branded clothing and footwear marketer Skye Products for R115,6-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng-based Skye, best known for distributing international brands of running shoes and clothing to stores and independent retailers throughout the country for the last 32 years, will treble the size of Cape-based LA Retail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skye chairman Brian Zylstra said he had been attracted to the deal by LA's strong emphasis on building brand names and the fact that &quot;I don't believe any company will survive the year 2000 without black empowerment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, while Skye focused on the mass market, LA Retail focused on high-fashion retailing, which meant they were not in competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA Retail chief executive Abdul &quot;AK&quot; Peer said that there was a strong synergy between the two businesses, which would give LA Retail exposure to the full spectrum of the South African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peer said the deal would be financed by placing four million ordinary shares at 425c a share with LA management and 24,6- million N shares at 400c each with institutional investors, the existing management team of Skye and business associates of LA Retail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be based on profit warranties of a pre-tax profit of not less than R22-million in the period to February 28 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peer said &quot;virtually all&quot; institutional investors and several black empowerment groups had taken up the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deal is effective from March 1 and is expected to boost LA's earnings to 27,5c a share from 19,2c and its net asset value per share to 83,8c from 52,6c.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skye Products is the only South African licence holder of international brands such as Converse, Saucony and Dickie and supplies more than 3000 independent retails as well as major chain stores. It also distributes Mille, Jump and Brentwood footwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its turnover for the financial year to February 28 was R110-million with pre-tax profits of R17,5-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peer said the two business would retain their separate identities and management teams and that LA Retail's Samson brand would be moved to the branding division of Skye within the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident that Skye's proven management and branded products will significantly enhance the growth of LA Retail Stores,&quot; Peer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zylstra has agreed to stay on for the next 18 months while other top Skye managers have been given five-year contracts so as not to disrupt management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked how Skye was being affected by illegal imports, Zylstra said this had been a factor but the work by British customs officials at Durban harbour and the introduction of quotas was beginning to have the desired effect.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Organising Jo'burg's streets is crucial to new investment, but street traders are taking issue with the new laws, reports Ferial Haffajee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implementation of state-of-the-art by- laws to streamline hawking on Johannesburg's streets has been indefinitely delayed as the Johannesburg Metropolitan Council hurries to start a hawker education programme, meant to have been completed by the middle of April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now organised hawkers say they will not give the by-laws their stamp of approval until the council issues permits only to &quot;bonafide South African unemployed hawkers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The laws were passed in the first week of this year but the council set itself no official implementation date even though the city's senior business leaders see them as key to getting existing businesses to stay in the city and to drawing in new investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You must remember this is a completely new arena of city management for us, &quot; says Roger Hand, the council official in charge of implementing the by-laws.  New staff must be trained to educate hawkers, legal officials in seven magisterial districts have yet to establish a system to prosecute offenders, while the council has not yet decided which authority will police the streets where about 20 000 hawkers earn a living.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1993, the then Johannesburg City Council threw open the pavements with its new Businesses Act. Rapid urbanisation plus retrenchments across a range of industries has seen many entrepreneurs take to the streets in the past four years, selling everything from vegetables to cosmetics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, the provincial and metropolitan governments and several hawkers' organisations met to begin negotiating new laws to govern hawking: they looked at stall sizes, access for pedestrians and fair deals for shop-owners who often complained that hawkers were obstructing their businesses.  Marathon negotiating sessions yielded a set of simple laws that seemed to walk the tight-rope between encouraging innovative small traders while keeping the city orderly. &quot;We even submitted the by-laws to parliament's small business portfolio committee so that other provinces could use them,&quot; says the Reverend Sibusiso Mendlula of Johannesburg's Micro-business Chamber, which yokes together five different hawker groupings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things went wrong as soon as implementation plans began. Hawkers charge that they were left out of these as city bureaucrats hired expensive consultants to do the work. &quot;Hawkers should be trained to train other hawkers, &quot; says Livingstone Mantanga, who heads the Federated Association of Informal Traders and Hawkers (Faith).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hand says hawkers have been involved with the four pilot training projects he's run for hawkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the traders have tagged their biggest gripe to the successful implementation of the by-laws. &quot;We want permits and (by-law) training only for unemployed South Africans as a first priority,&quot; says Mantanga. &quot;This place is over-flowing with Pakistanis, Chinese, Zimbabweans, Zaireans, you name it. They sell cheaply and they disadvantage our brothers.&quot; Mantanga and other hawker organisers say that permit-holders should have to provide South African identity documents; but they also want hawkers who are employed by other business people to be cleared off the streets. They charge that many foreign hawkers work for wholesalers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most vegetable hawkers are no longer of the rand-a-pack stock who used to populate the street. Instead, many are dropped off with plates full of vegetables early in the morning by wholesalers and paid at night. Many wholesalers also pay bread-sellers like Alberto Magea to sell their loaves.  &quot; I get paid R90 a week,&quot; says the young Mozambican.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hand says the council will educate all hawkers, regardless of where they're from. &quot;Dealing with foreigners is not a local government issue,&quot; he says. The council is also not able to stop employed hawkers from peddling their wares because the Business Act does not define who is and who is not a street trader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the first of a series of articles on economic policy, Asghar Adelzadeh of the National Institute for Economic Policy looks at industrial development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's industrial development has been and remains deficient, with serious problems: a lack of capacity in intermediate and capital goods; an aged capital stock, reflecting limited investment in the past; declining shares in critical world markets for manufactured exports; a lack of integration across sectors; limited skills and employment opportunities for the workforce, complemented by poorly trained and inadequate management; a highly concentrated pattern of corporate ownership that straddles the economy as a whole and not just industry; an institutional structure and governance that continues to reflect the economic and industrial imperatives of the past; and a highly skewed distribution of economic and industrial activity within South Africa and across the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, inadequate finance for industry, co-ordination of investment across sectors, formulation, implementation and monitoring of sectoral strategies, and co-ordination across government departments and other agencies raise concern; as do corporate strategies inconsistent with the policies required for industrial reconstruction; and macro-economic policy that is unduly influenced by short-term financial rather than longer-term economic imperatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifying the scope and content of industrial policy is extremely difficult. Almost any economic policy of any significance is liable to affect industrial performance and, consequently, can be considered to constitute a component of industrial policy. Even those who would seek to minimise the role of industrial policy, in preference to favouring the market and avoiding state intervention, can be interpreted as adopting an industrial policy of a particular type.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, the sensitivity of industrial performance to a range of influences means that policies that directly or indirectly affect research and development, training and skills, regional distribution of economic activity, for example, also qualify, at least in principle, as industrial policies. Such side-effects are, for example, especially important in the case of macro-economic policy, industrial relations and labour market policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, it is necessary neither to take a fixed nor a limited view of what constitutes industrial policy even though this has happened traditionally in South Africa as elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In formulating an industrial strategy, the following should be given the highest priority:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Role of Investment: Through a variety of overlapping mechanisms - for example scale economies, externalities, economic linkages, spill-over effects, learning by doing, research and development, education and training, evolving entrepreneurship - investment and growth have the potential to be self-sustaining and mutually reinforcing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the perspective of industrial policy and the central role to be played by investment, the weakness of the government's position stands out sharply in its macro-economic policy, especially the growth, employment and redistribution (Gear) strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it should be commended for emphasising the need to raise and sustain the level of investment, it is sorely deficient because the strategy is heavily oriented to improving business confidence, and is overly optimistic with respect to the responsiveness of investment to the strategy. This is hardly surprising given that the main orientation of Gear is to hit macro- economic targets, such as the fiscal deficit, with an implicit presumption that doing so will suffice to induce appropriate levels of effective investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Role of Finance: One of the key issues in determining investment is the role played by the financial institutions in mobilising and deploying funds.  International evidence suggests that the nature of a financial system is crucial in determining the levels, composition and effectiveness of investment. The South African financial system is generally acknowledged to be deficient in promoting appropriate industrial investment and policy.  Serious consideration must be given to relations between finance and industry.  An investigation into industrial policy should be undertaken with a particular emphasis upon the role played by finance for industrial investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among issues to be investigated are the past, present and prospective sources of finance for investment and the institutional arrangements governing the relations between finance and industry, covering both macro- economic and micro- economic issues, distinguishing between different sectors and enterprise scale and type of ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Role of Foreign Investment: Also to be explicitly addressed is the role played by direct foreign investment, drawing upon best practice in assessing the net socio- economic impact of such investment. There should be no presumption that the overall impact will be significant relative to what needs to be provided from domestic resources, and investments need to be carefully assessed in the light of sectorally specific circumstances and outcomes. An undue courting of direct foreign investment will be damaging to policy making more generally, and will engender support for policies that could even weaken investment from domestic resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Role of Trade Policy: Policy makers have in general pursued trade liberalisation beyond the level even required by the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is despite the negative impact on some industries, and the failure to formulate and put adequate supply-side policies in place before liberalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The justification for, and impact of, trade liberalisation has rested to a large extent on the calculation of effective rates of protection. These are, however, ill-founded conceptually in how they have been calculated, and as a guide to policy in their imputed effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, they take no account of dynamic and static economies of scale and scope, excess capacity, capital-labour intensity, market structure, presence of multi-nationals, skill requirements of the labour force and management, developments in world markets, product differentiation and quality, commercial risk, age structure of capital stock, the differential impact of non-tradeables, and the substitution between capital and labour in production in response to changing input prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than assessing trade independently of industrial policy, the two must be integrated, with neither logical nor sequential priority attached to trade policy. Exactly the opposite is happening in South Africa. The process of dismantling protection preceded the election of the ANC government and is to gather momentum under Gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is essential that appropriate sectoral industrial strategies are put in place, insisting upon co-operation from large business if necessary, prior to any further trade liberalisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Implementation and Monitoring: As important as the formulation of policy is how it will be implemented and monitored. The choice of particular policies does not guarantee that they will be adopted at all nor in the way in which it was intended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, policy can never be specified in complete detail so there is always flexibility in interpretation and in practice. Who participates in the implementation of policy and how thus becomes crucial. Clearly, government will play a major role in general but its role will depend upon the institutions with which it works, the capacity of those institutions and their staff, and the way policy is put into effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, implementation and monitoring of policy should overlap considerably. One particular role that can be played by monitoring is in ensuring that broader goals are targeted and achieved whenever government intervenes through industrial or other policy. In the context of contract compliance, for example, government as a major customer of industry can impose a number of conditions on its suppliers in order to implement and monitor policy, over and above the traditional concerns of price, quality and delivery time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contracts may usefully incorporate requirements on the development of education and skills, security of employment, the development and sharing of technology, affirmative action, and observance of general government policy and specific sectoral policy, such as export targeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the above issues are already high on the government's agenda but others are not. Even where they are high on the agenda, sufficient attention is not always paid to their impact on industrial policy. Moreover, too great an emphasis has been placed on less important determinants of a successful industrial policy, such as promoting a spurious business confidence, privatisation and mega-projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In short, there is a need for an industrial policy that gives top priority to the above issues and ensures that efficient, effective and equitable policies are adopted within the context of larger objectives of meeting basic needs, generation of employment, education and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa could itself take a lead in the formulation of a new agenda for industrial policy, to its own benefit as well as to the advantage of other developing countries, especially those in Africa which have been least affected in practice by the new currents in development policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is based on a paper commissioned by the National Institute for Economic Policy from Professor Ben Fine of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African stock markets</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* IN Ethiopia, the sixth African Finance Ministers' Conference this week resolved to establish regional stock markets on the continent to bolster developing capital markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference also pleaded for greater flexibility in the application of debt relief measures for the world's poorest countries. World aid to Africa has dropped significantly, but the debt burden has increased. At the end of last year, African countries owed $340,5-billion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coke adds Asian fizz</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A MERGER between Australian and Filipino bottlers of Coca-Cola will create the biggest bottling operation outside the United States. This week, Australia's Coca- Cola Amatil Ltd sold 293-million shares to the Philippine's San Miguel Corporation. The shares are valued at $2,68-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dow Jones slides</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Dow Jones industrial average dipped below the 6,500-level this week for the first time since early January. The Dow lost about 94 points after sliding by more than 100 points twice during the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shares were pressured from the opening by another jittery day in the bond market, where long-term interest rates flirted with another six-month high.  European stock markets followed Wall Street's lead, and some prices slid deeper into negative territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CompuServe for sale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The parent company of CompuServe Inc is in talks to sell the troubled online service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CompuServe and H&amp;R Block Inc did not name a bidder, but CompuServe stock has risen sharply this week following market rumours that America Online (AOL) was thinking of buying the company. AOL needs more equipment to unclog its network bottlenecks, and CompuServe has been losing money amid subscriber defections to rival service providers. CompuServe is also strong in Europe and Japan, where AOL has been trying to expand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazil's trade gap</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* BRAZIL's trade deficit in March was 10 times as big as it was in the same month last year, the trade ministry said. The figures, consistent with a trend spurred by an overvaluation of the Brazilian real against the dollar in 1996, could threaten the stability of the country's anti- inflation plan, economists said. That plan kept inflation down to 10% last year, but it made imports cheaper for Brazilians. The March trade figures showed the deficit rising to $1 026-million from $109-million the year before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GE joins bid race</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* BRITAIN's General Electric has bid for the French government's 58% stake in electronics group Thomson-CSF. General Electric filed the bid with the French Finance Ministry last Friday, placing it in competition with French telecommunications giant Alcatel Alsthom and defence and media group Lagard re, according to the financial daily La Tribune.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A Johannesburg marketing company is fighting the Airports Company Ltd (ACL) for damages incurred after the parastatal restricted business relating to the rugby World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 15 the ACL regulator will hear the case between the parastatal and tiny Airport World Sales (AWS), which claims practices by ACL cost it R950000 in lost profits by denying it access to sell rugby memorabilia at Johannesburg International Airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Gary Burns also claims AWS spent about R100 000 preparing its case against ACL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In May 1996, the regulating committee found that ACL had &quot;transgressed&quot; a law stating the parastatal must ensure it does not engage in restrictive practices. The violation involved ACL's stipulation to the Stellenbosch Rugby Club, which held the rights to sell rugby World Cup memorabilia at the airport, that it could only transfer those rights to existing airport vendors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That stipulation precluded AWS - which was not an existing vendor - from selling the rugby products, even though Burns claims the company had secured the rights from Stellenbosch. The club later agreed to retail the memorabilia through Fedics, one of the major vendors at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AWS wants ACL to pay more than R1-million; ACL officials believe the settlement should be more in the area of R30 000, says one source close to the negotiations. This is the first time the regulatory committee has had to decide a monetary settlement in a dispute involving ACL.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Communications Minister Jay Naidoo is definitely going to sell another 10% of Telkom. He just hasn't worked out how he's going to do it yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's R5,58-billion deal to sell a third of Telkom to American and Malaysian partners was signed without an empowerment component.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naidoo's next task will be to fine-tune the plan to sell a slice of Telkom to workers, black businesses and other disadvantaged groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've done no detailed work on it yet,&quot; says Naidoo's representative Connie Molusi, adding, &quot;We put it aside to concentrate on the other deal.&quot; But the ministry wants to push through the next sale by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shares are likely to be placed in a national empowerment fund that the government will soon establish. This fund will collect contributions from all privatisation deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Framework Agreement, forged last year between government and labour, provides that all state sell-offs will have some empowerment quotient.  But the agreement is thin on the detail of how this should be done - as are the trade unions that operate at Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Communications Workers Union, affiliated to the Congress of South African Trade Unions, says it wants to have speedy talks with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union's general secretary Seleboho Kiti says a trust should be established to administer the shares. His union is concerned that a general empowerment fund is too vague: it will likely push for a specific Telkom sub- fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union says proceeds from the shares must be used to encourage workers to stay in the industry by offering them a career path in telecommunications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggests that workers be trained to run phone shops or start up subcontracting businesses to win some of the contracts to connect the 1,8- million lines Telkom has committed itself to providing in the next five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenny Cargill of the consultancy BusinessMap says some of the next tranche of Telkom shares are likely to be placed in the empowerment fund. &quot;A general fund pools the risk for people buying into it,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund could operate like a unit trust. It will also be similar to retail vehicles - the new empowerment initiatives started by big companies like Johnnic and M-Net - which give ordinary black shareholders a chance to buy shares by putting down a deposit and paying off the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions and unaffiliated employees could be given shares by way of employee share option participation schemes. The majority white South African Telecommunications Association says all employees should be given the same share options, with no special shares for trade unions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The trade department is set to launch its Competitiveness Fund, which draws on specialists to help small businesses grow, reports Madeleine Wackernagel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is to seek tender applications for an operator to run its Competitiveness Fund by the end of this month. The fund, established to help small businesses compete in the global market, has been given the green light by the State Tender Board almost 18 months after the initial feasibility studies were completed. It should be up and running by the final quarter of this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not to be confused with the DTI's other small-business initiatives such as the Khula financing arm and the Ntsika Enterprise Agency, the Competitiveness Fund will run on a matching grant basis, whereby an applicant has to put up 50% of the financing to demonstrate their commitment. The fund will then provide advice on marketing, production and general business strategy with the aid of a registrar of specialists, who will be drawn from technikons, universities and private consulting firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Critics argue that the programme will do little to boost local competitiveness given that it will concentrate on the export market, but Dr Alistair Ruiters of the DTI's centre for small business development was quick to dispel this claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, emphasis will be placed on helping firms to break into the export sector, but others will receive help in defending their local market share against imports by developing a niche, in line with the Asian tigers' experience, thereby strengthening their position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a division of the World Bank, has put up a $50-million loan, the South African government has been very much in charge of devising the project, together with the constituencies of the National Economic Development and Labour Council, says the bank's Junaid Ahmad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complexity of the programme probably mitigates against a local company alone doing the job of operating the fund. &quot;It's hard to say who will bid and who will win, but international experience would be a big plus,&quot; says Ruiters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This is a very sophisticated programme. The World Bank indicated when we were originally devising this project that there are very few firms worldwide with the kind of expertise and experience necessary to run the fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But crucial to our decision is that if an international company is chosen as operator, it must ensure that those skills are transferred to a local partner. So we are looking at joint ventures and other collaborative enterprises.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project is two-pronged, concentrating on small and medium-sized businesses on the one hand, and micro enterprises with fewer than 20 employees on the other. This latter part will be covered by the Bumble Bee Programme (BPP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The BBP will be run on the same lines, with accredited consultants giving four free hours of services. We were concerned that the bigger businesses would get the lion's share of help, so this provides a perfect stepping stone for the really small companies. But to run the BPP the operator must have local know-how,&quot; says Ruiters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would not be drawn on the sums involved but stressed that they are significant enough to warrant a thorough tendering process. &quot;It is time- consuming but necessary. We have to keep our integrity, otherwise we lose support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a very important supply-side measure that has taken a great deal of work; we don't want anything to go wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a jarring familiarity to the way the Sudanese refer to &quot;them&quot; - the tall, dark strangers now found in abundance in their northern cities.

And now they are fighting. It's very bloody .  .. It is true of the whole of Africa.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It spoils the careful speech he has just delivered to reassure me that nothing like apartheid exists in the Sudan. &quot;People think Arabs are persecuting Africans,&quot; says Tourabi, speculating aloud why the new South Africa has kept his government at arm's length. &quot;They think we are fair- skinned like the Saudi Arabians or the Egyptians&quot; - -an allusion to the dark complexions of the Sudanese Arabs - &quot;but we don't believe in colour here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourabi is a silver-tongued old fox. His Islamic revolution is more a product of student activism at Leeds Polytechnic and London University in the Sixties than of the Mahdi Mohammedans, who frightened the wits out of late- Victorian England, waving General Gordon's head on a stick. Tourabi's Muslim Brotherhood represents an elite of educated young men who have secured the most important civil service and military jobs, but are struggling to take the rest of society with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid the dust and chaotic traffic of Khartoum, where even the ubiquitous goats are unable to eliminate the plastic garbage and men in turbans ride donkeys against a backdrop of Pepsi billboards, it is evident that the Islamist revolution has failed to deliver. According to the United Nations, half of all Sudanese lived below the poverty line 10 years ago; that figure has risen to more than 80%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any street-side pundit will tell you that the economy is being dragged down by the war in the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Sudan belongs to the Great Lakes region. But the country was tacked on to Egypt, a Middle Eastern country, in the 19th century, first as a reservoir for slaves and then to secure Egyptian control of the Nile's headwaters. The rights of the southern Sudanese have been ignored and trampled on by the Ottomans, the Egyptians, the Mahdists, the British and, since 1956, the successive regimes in Khartoum.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for a window of peace between 1972 and 1985, the south has been in rebellion since the British colonial administration hastily departed in 1956, leaving a country united under one flag, but politically, ethnically and religiously at odds. It is the longest-running war in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since January it has escalated dramatically. The rebels of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) have opened up a 480km front in the east, launching fresh assaults from Eritrea and Ethiopia. An even more threatening offensive from Uganda has resulted in rebels capturing a string of major towns and marching on the southern capital of Juba. The United States, keen to harass what it labels a &quot;terrorist&quot; Islamic fundamentalist state with close ties to Iran, is pouring aid into the rebel armies via Eritrea and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war in Sudan goes to the heart of the conflict that is ripping Africa apart. It has been overshadowed by the collapse of Zaire, but it is an integral part of a conflagration that could end with the redrawing of the continental map.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudanese support for the Lord's Resistance Army, a Christian fundamentalist group that is waging a secessionist war in northern Uganda, has drawn Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni into the Sudanese conflict. By supporting the SPLA in southern Sudan and Laurent Kabila's rebels in eastern Zaire, he has created a buffer zone around his country. He has also launched the creation of what could be a wider union in central Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refugees are pouring into Khartoum, religious and cultural strangers who are undermining the dream of an Islamic state. Up to a million-and-a-half displaced people have come to the city in the past eight years. Most of them have been moved out into camps on the harsh monochrome sand of the desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here, where you would expect to see at most a camel or a palm tree, a vision of cane, hessian and bamboo frames shimmers like a mirage - a city of 300 000 scarecrow people. It is a human dumping ground, without a blade of grass for a goat, placed by the city government next to the Khartoum sewage dump, where human turds lie heaped on the desert sand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita X is cooking a large pot of beans inside the camp. She helps distribute food relief to starving children inside a flimsy bamboo shack covered with Unicef sacks. Six years ago she fled with her husband and family to escape the fighting around Malacal, further up the Nile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arabs harass you in the street,&quot; says Rita. &quot;They say you are pagans, kaffirs.&quot; Is it because of your religion? I ask. &quot;No,&quot; she replies, without hesitation. &quot;The first problem is our colour.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Celia Y, a 23-year-old beauty who fled the area around Juba, says: &quot;Even on the buses, if there is an Arab, you have to give him a seat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people of the south name their camps Soweto and Mandela, making clear their identification with the victims of apartheid in South Africa. Many had built brick homes in neighbourhoods of Omdurman, an inner-city area on the east bank of the Nile. But their homes and schools were bulldozed. Entire neighbourhoods were razed at a few days' notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita X and her husband had built a house in Omdurman, close to the market in the city centre. Her story reads like a Black Sash affidavit from the Seventies. She says: &quot;One Tuesday the government came and told us we are not the people for these houses. We are not Arabs. They said we must be gone by Saturday when they would come and pull the house down. Everyone had to take their roofs along. Some tried to protest, but the soldiers opened fire, killing nine people. After the first protestors were gunned down, people realised that resistance was futile and started taking down their shacks. The government vehicles took us and dumped us in the desert.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some southerners cling tenaciously to their old neighbourhoods in the city, living in mud huts among their demolished houses. Others have been driven to the margins, residing in the stench of the Omdurman garbage dump. &quot;They would rather live on a dump than face the uncertainty of the desert,&quot; says Father Paul Boyle, a young Scottish Catholic priest who ran a school in a neighbourhood that was demolished a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The big desert camp outside Omdurman is called Dar El Salaam (Peace). The second camp, even more flimsy and further into the desert, has been renamed by its &quot;displaced&quot; residents As-Alaam (They Forced Us).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are no roads, taxi ranks or clinics. Donkey carts carry cylindrical canisters, selling precious water brought up from wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donor fatigue set in long ago. The aid agencies bring water, medical care and a little food to the camps, but there are chronic shortages of food. Only the Catholic Church appears to have increased its presence. It has 60 foreign priests in Khartoum, the footsoldiers of a new holy war. The priests relish the irony that a government which sought to Islamise the people of the south is facing a challenge in its own front yard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the young people are coming to the churches,&quot; says Boyle. &quot;Southerners fleeing the war are converting to Christianity in Khartoum, bringing Christianity to the north.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has become a socially acceptable way of opposing the government,&quot; says another aid worker. &quot;The church is a link with a larger, more powerful world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tourabi is hard-pressed to explain how Islamist rule has improved life even for his own people. He brags that Sudan is sitting on &quot;lakes of oil&quot;, but his regime is increasingly isolated and economically strangled by US-led sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan's great experiment in Islamism is in fact relatively progressive. In contrast to their avowed enemies, the Saudis, Sudanese women have been promoted into major positions in society. US claims that Sudan is training terrorist groups appear grossly exaggerated. Sharia law is on the books, but it is limited to occasional public flogging and does not go to the extremes of limb amputation. The failure of strict Islamic law can be seen in the number of prostitutes on street corners at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most profound failure is within Muslim society itself. Abdel Wahad A-El Mubarak, an Islamic scholar and former minister of education, says Tourabi's political Islam misconceives the nature of the religion in the Sudan, where Sufis predominate. &quot;It is a very individualist religion. We would rather educate the people to become good Muslims,&quot; he says. &quot;The government is just using Islam as a political slogan to influence the masses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the masses are not enthused. After the attacks of January 12, there was a lukewarm response to the government's jihad theatre, where imams in camouflage uniforms with AK-47s and webbing exhorted the masses to rise against Jews, foreigners and infidels. &quot;If it was a proper jihad, all the sects would have come up and supported it,&quot; says Mubarak. &quot;But no. All the big sheikhs are keeping silent. Silence has great power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The escalation in fighting has brought renewed hope that the deadlock might be broken. The SPLA, under John Garang, has formed an alliance with former prime minister Sadek al-Mahdi, Tourabi's brother-in-law and hereditary leader of one-third of Sudan's Muslims. If victorious, Mahdi would grant southern Sudan the right to choose independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Khartoum, in separate talks with a breakaway group of rebels, has also accepted the right of the south to hold a plebiscite to determine whether it would like to be independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of that agreement, we have accepted the south can secede if they choose,&quot; says Tourabi. &quot;If two people are married, it is up to them to stay or to separate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the war is far from over. The SPLA, heartened by the support from the US and Museveni, is not about to trust the word of Khartoum. And the vexed question of who would own the petroleum in south-central Sudan has not even been broached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rita X believes there can be no reconciliation between north and south Sudan: &quot;If unity is what God wants, then maybe that is OK, but we don't think it is what he wants.&quot; She wants to go home to the green savannah when this is all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a big breakthrough,&quot; says the white-haired Abel Alier, a veteran southern politician who believes there is no doubt that the south, provoked by the narrow-mindedness of the Islamist government, will opt to secede. For many years the rebels had fought to democratise all of Sudan. But now Alier shakes his head as he gazes out of his dingy law offices at the street below: &quot;They made a mistake, trying to make us into Muslims and Arabs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dear Walter,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the life. Wish you were here soaking up the sun on the beach in Maputo, the beautiful Graca running supplies of tiger prawns down from the presidential kitchens whistling Handel's wedding march.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I did need to get away from it all. The burdens of office are onerous and there is a danger, if one keeps one's nose to the grindstone too long, of losing one's grasp on reality.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, I fear, is happening to Kader Asmal, our Minister of Water, Woods and Mushroom Affairs. Kader, who as you may recall spent the exile years in Ireland, seems to have been driven over the edge by the steady drip of rain which is a feature of life in those northern climes and often has the same effect as Chinese water torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kader's phobia takes the form of a passionate belief that South Africa is fast becoming a desert and that squabbles over dwindling water resources will trigger World War III in the region. A strange aspect of this obsession is that the more it rains, the more frantic Kader becomes - --seemingly with the rationale that there is a limited amount of the stuff up there and if it comes down here that will be an end to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His phobia came to a head shortly before my departure, when the civil authorities in our major cities were exhorting commuters to wear their water- wings to work, or risk being swept away in raging torrents of drain-water.  This drove Kader to a state of such extreme agitation that I was forced to concede to his demands for an emergency Cabinet meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He arrived dripping wet and was the very picture of indignation as he denounced the wastage of our water resources from the midst of a puddle on the priceless Persian carpet ornamenting the floor of the Cabinet room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">e station with suitably embarrassing consequences for the fibber * He then announced urgent and far-reaching proposals to save our precious water supples:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Shower-heads would be adjusted to allow one drip every 34 seconds. This would provide for more leisure time, he explained; citizens could do press- ups, draft that overdue letter, or change the baby's nappy between drips.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Urinals automatically flushing every hour on the half-hour would be banned as being in conflict with Sod's Law as well as the radio news on which he often featured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Watering of whiskey would be banned and ice-cubes would be allowed for ornamental purposes only - --to be returned to the ice-tray before losing 5% of their surface area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dual-flush mechanism for toilets. This fiendishly clever device would have one lever for solids and one lever for liquids, the latter using less water to flush. Users would swear a deposition as to their deposit and if this was contradicted by an assortment of scientific devices built into the toilet bowl an alarm would be triggered in the ere is only so much conservation that a nation can tolerate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ensconced on the toilet seat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kader was just getting down to his schedule of punitive measures for water guzzlers when I made my excuses and left for the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was a great relief to get outside and see it had stopped raining.  'Apartheid' in the Sowetos of Sudan</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Benjamin Pogrund joins the debate over the Jewish community and its role in apartheid</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A HAUNTING memory as a child in Cape Town is of my father weeping when news reached him in the 1940s about the murder of our relatives in Lithuania. They were among the more than 260 000 Jews wiped out in that country by Germany's Nazis and their local followers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I never knew the uncles and aunts and cousins who had stayed when my parents emigrated to South Africa in the 1920s. All that remains of them is a faded photograph.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of South Africa's Jews originated from Lithuania and suffered the same loss as my father. The Holocaust in Europe, in which 6-million Jews perished, was seared into the consciousness of Jews here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should surely have driven them into total opposition to racism in South Africa. Many did respond in this way and hence the vital and honourable role of many Jews in fighting apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as Claudia Braude described in &quot;Yutar and 'holy disbelief'&quot; in last week's Mail &amp; Guardian, others followed the road of collaboration after the National Party took power in 1948 and embarked on apartheid. Their behaviour contradicted their heritage all the more because there was recent experience of Nationalist support for Nazi Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent of the anti-Semitism in South Africa in the 1930s and 1940s is difficult to comprehend in the liberated atmosphere of the new South Africa.  But in the lifetime of many living today, it was a potent factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's a contemporaneous view of what it was like, written in 1944 in a booklet called South African Jewry by Edgar Bernstein, a noted Jewish journalist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He spoke of the worldwide aspirations of the Nazis after they had seized power in Germany in 1933: &quot;They envisaged the annexation of South Africa in a vast German world empire no less than they envisaged the incorporation of other lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, as soon as the Nazi machine was effectively in operation in Germany, racial divisions in South Africa were seized upon as fertile ground for National Socialist propaganda. Germany sent out leaflets which played upon the racial differences of the South African population ... As documents seized by the police subsequently revealed, a propaganda network to spread the Nazi virus in South Africa was built up, chiefly through the German consulates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Enormous energy&quot; was put into making Jews appear as &quot;the universal bogey which the Nazis have everywhere tried to depict them - the quintessence of capitalism and Bolshevism; the voice of wealth and labour's agitation; Christ and anti-Christ - all the contradictions Nazi ingenuity could devise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For South Africa, these allegations were given a special local colouring; the cunning propaganda talked of 'British Jewish imperialism', thus linking the Jews with that aspect of South African history which had caused most bitterness in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A specialised propaganda was built around the false allegation that Jews were anti-Afrikaans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This agitation &quot;helped the Nazi followers and dupes&quot; in South Africa, said Bernstein: &quot;Comparisons favourable to Germany were made, the suggestion was propounded that the Nazi system be introduced here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anti-Semitism also crept into the National Party which had emerged during the 1930s as the Herenigde Nasionale Party (Purified Nationalist Party) led by Dr DF Malan, a former dominee and ex-editor of Die Burger (Malan became the first apartheid prime minister after the 1948 election).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the parliamentary election of 1938 anti-Semitism was made a political issue for the first time in South Africa, and swayed many votes in a number of constituencies. A Nationalist newspaper, Die Transvaler, was started in Johannesburg and began consistently to attack the South African Jewish community,&quot; Bernstein wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Die Transvaler's editor was Dr HF Verwoerd, later prime minister and architect of the Bantustan policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His newspaper set out the National Party's standpoint in these words: &quot;No Jew can become a member of the Herenigde Nasionale Party and thus try to exercise influence on the policy of the state; all illegal and undesirable Jewish immigrants ... must be repatriated; all further Jewish immigration must be immediately stopped; no further naturalisation of Jews must take place ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, not all Afrikaners were antagonistic, said Bernstein. Former prime minister JBM Hertzog was &quot;scrupulously fair&quot; towards Jews while Jan Smuts and JH Hofmeyr denounced anti-Semitism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a majority in Parliament sided with Smuts and voted in 1939 to take South Africa into World War II against Nazi Germany, the Nationalists launched a new propaganda campaign, Bernstein noted. &quot;They raised the cry that the British and the Jews had dragged the country into war against the wishes of the Afrikaner population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malan at first was certain the Allies would be defeated. As the tide of war changed he and the Nationalists adopted what they called &quot;an attitude of strict neutrality&quot;. But, said Bernstein, in practice this &quot;neutrality&quot; went together with such criticism of the Allies and such lack of criticism of the Nazi side that &quot;it was almost indistinguishable from the pro-Nazi line which the party had formerly pursued&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four years after Bernstein wrote this the Nationalists, against all expectations, were voted into office by an electorate consisting mainly of whites. Again I have a memory as a young boy of the tremor of fear that their victory sent through the adult Jews around me: the Nazi-lovers were in power and what dire fate now awaited South Africa's Jews?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, despite the threats and pro-Nazi stance, once the Nationalists were in government they never took any overt hostile action against the Jewish community. It seems that the Nationalists decided they had to hold the white minority together and realised they needed the Jewish community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the Jewish side, the fear instilled by the Nationalists was a reminder of past insecurity and pogroms and drove some to put their morality aside and to seek safety through silence and, later, connivance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Portrait of a woman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH writer who made something of a name for herself in Johannesburg has now made it into the big time in New York, in more ways than one. Emma Gilbey - a scion of the gin family and cousin of James Gilbey who won fame for christening Princess Di &quot;Squidgy&quot; - authored a scandalous biography of Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, called The Lady.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since moving on to the Big Apple from the Big Sulphur, Emma has found herself the centre of scandal, as the mother-to-be of a child by Bill Keller, the brilliant 48-year-old foreign editor of the New York Times. Keller, a Pulitzer Prize winner, was until recently the South African correspondent of the New York Times, living in Johannesburg with his wife, Ann - the correspondent of America's National Public Radio - and their adopted child.  Friends of Keller now fear that the scandal may have robbed him of a shot at the editorship of America's most prestigious newspaper, the proprietors of which set great store by &quot;family values&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mammon goes to Moria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The only newspaper allowed on sale inside the Zionist Christian Church's (ZCC) entrepreneurial Easter bash at the weekend was the Sunday Times. This was not unconnected with the newspaper carrying a grovelling interview with the ZCC's spiritual leader, Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane, under the headline &quot; His Amazing Grace&quot;. The interview was not the only report written on the ZCC boss for the newspaper. A more critical assessment of the bishop and his empire had been prepared for publication, but was suddenly axed in favour of the interview negotiated by Lekganyane's spokesman, former Sunday Times staffer Ezra Mantini. The Sunday Times is said to have sold an additional 10000 copies in and around Moria. The wages of fearless journalism .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boesak's farewell to innocence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* BOESAK-WATCHERS are agog at evidence that their man has prescience verging on the psychic. It is to be found in his doctoral thesis - a socio- ethical study on black theology and power written more than 20 years ago and subsequently published as a book.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* SOUTH AFRICA's attachment to l-o-n-g weekends seems to be getting an ideological underpinning in the new South Africa. Last Thursday everyone at the Department of Correctional Services who could talk to the press had gone home by 11am. Gone home, we were told, because it's a long weekend. Surely it's a bit early, we asked. &quot;No,&quot; snarled the only person left in the department, &quot;they are making up for working overtime all of their lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dangerous petrochemical agents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MINERAL and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna is going through a period of seeing spooks around every petrol tanker. Recently one of his bodyguards was shot at, caught in the crossfire of an everyday South African- style car hijacking. Maduna, in a paroxysm of paranoia, phoned Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and told him he was being targeted by petrochemical agents who were out &quot;to get me&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It has been observed that it is as well to be remembered after one's death, but better not to be found out before one's death. Chris Hani has been blessed in both respects. Hero-worshipped by millions before his assassination, he has now been remembered in perpetuity - -or something approaching it - by having the largest hospital in the world (together with a couple of ancillary establishments) named after him by the Gauteng Cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, admiring though most of us are of the memory of Hani, the honour is premature. There is, admittedly, little even in the way of journalistic gossip to threaten the reputation of the former leader of the South African Communist Party and Umkhonto weSizwe commander. But he did feature - if only by way of unsubstantiated allegation - in the African National Congress detention camps scandal, being accused of helping oversee summary executions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The camps scandal still has to be dealt with by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. If the allegations were to be substantiated against Hani, it would be grounds for some embarrassment to have an institution, dedicated to healing, named after a man who showed a callous disregard for human life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are confident that this will not happen, but it is an example of the dangers inherent in rushing to ennoble the recently dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is (a touch ironically) the Ministry of Defence which has given the country an impressive lead when it comes to honouring individuals in this way.  This week, on the 75th anniversary of the launch of the navy, they renamed eight strike-craft which had previously been named by the Nationalists after former ministers of defence. The names chosen included five 18th-century chiefs, one hero from World War I and two from World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgement of time ensures that none of them stands in danger of being &quot; found out&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IT has been the best of weeks and the worst of weeks for South African culture. While thugs were meting out their own special breed of cultural elitism at the Klein Karoo National Arts Festival in Oudtshoorn, another group of quietly dedicated cultural workers was busy launching the most important arts body yet established in post-apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What happened in the Karoo cannot and should not be dismissed, as it has been by the festival organisers, as the work of eight irresponsible individuals. Those present witnessed a far larger group hurling beer cans and political abuse at the likes of Miriam Makeba, Amanda Strydom and Johannes Kerkorrel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amid calls for tolerance from Makeba - during what was only her second live performance since returning from exile - beer can missiles continued to fly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were to become the theme of the week. Later, at a stand-up comedy performance by Johnny Campher, three men in the audience called him an unamusing &quot;bloody Hotnot&quot; and threatened more beer cans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It gave the term &quot;lager mentality&quot; a whole new meaning. This was supposed to be the festival that placed the &quot;new Afrikaner&quot; in the spotlight. It succeeded, but not in the way expected. It held up the Afrikaner, warts and all, to scrutiny and analysis. But how else will things ever change?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The racist antics of a portion of the crowd forced those who opposed them to take a stand. The streets of Oudtshoorn became the real stage, with placards and politics flying - and a whole new breed of Afrikaner activists emerging, anxious to show that they cannot be defined by their racist brothers. The racial incidents were undeniably ugly, but they showed why festivals like the Klein Karoo are imperative to the future of arts and culture in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is something enormously exciting about the state of the arts in South Africa at the moment; a sense that we are at a turning point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent impact study done on the effects of the Grahamstown Arts Festival showed that the university town is walking away with a R25-million annual profit from the event. The festival is now planning a huge conference in June on the subject of the arts as a viable business - taking the lead from countries like Australia where the arts fall within the top 10 national money spinners and are not just the subjects of charitable handouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's launch of the National Arts Council - the first fruits of the arts and culture white paper - is, therefore, of potentially major significance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the first step towards the building of an industry that will not only garner income, but also help expose, analyse and treat the national psyche.  That is what happened in Oudtshoorn this week. That is part what the arts should be about.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lumbumbashi - Zaire's president has reinstated a dictatorial governor he removed four years ago. Chris McGreal reports from Lumbumbashi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT is four years since Kyungu wa Kumwanza tried to revive an independent Katanga with the brutal ethnic cleansing of one million people. He even went so far as to declare secession from Zaire. It cost the demagogic governor his post, and he was placed under house arrest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Kyungu is due to move into the governor's mansion again. President Mobutu Sese Seko ushered him back into office this week as rebel forces encroached ever deeper into Shaba, the southern province known as Katanga when United Nations troops killed its independence in the early 1960s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quite why Kyungu was reinstated is a mystery even he has difficulty explaining, other than as recognition of his undoubted popularity. But suspicion is rife in Shaba that Mobutu looks on the new governor as a means to weaken support for the rebels by reviving dreams of independence. It is a long shot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular opinion in Shaba has swung firmly behind Laurent Kabila's rebels.  They are within 250km of Lumbumbashi, Shaba's capital and the country's second-largest city, where people eagerly await the promise of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as news of Kyungu's reappointment was broadcast, a stream of well- wishers made for his home where the new governor met them dressed in black with a gold watch hanging loosely from his wrist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politicians and businessmen were there to sound out his position on the civil war, but Kyungu is firmly straddling the fence. Although he grew up in the same village in Shaba as Kabila, he is evasive about their relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know each other by name. We met, but he was not really my friend. Our families knew each other,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kyungu is also careful not to criticise the rebels. &quot;I don't have any problem with the rebels. The Zairean people want change. I'm among those who want things to change because the system of government we have didn't permit the development of the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all, Kyungu does not want to discuss secession any more. Perhaps he is trying to avoid upsetting Kabila, who insists that accusations he planned to split up Zaire are spurious charges aimed at justifying foreign intervention against the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shaba has more reason than most of Zaire to resent the central government.  Beside the brutal suppression of Katanga's secession from the newly independent Congo in the Sixties, and the use of foreign troops to end two revolts in the following decade, Shaba has seen little benefit from its vast mineral wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province was on the cusp of a flourishing future when uranium for the atom bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was mined at Shinkolobwe, 140km north-west of Lumbumbashi. Fifty years later, the state-owned company J Gecamines has concessions to enough minerals to make it the most profitable copper and cobalt mining firm in the world. But like much else in Zaire, Gecamines has fallen into ruin; its equipment systematically plundered or rotted into disrepair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu drained the firm of so much hard currency it could not pay its debts overseas. Last year, copper production fell to a miserly one tenth of its peak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even when Gecamines was functioning well, Shaba saw few benefits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lumbumbashi, a graceful if dilapidated city, is still in better shape than most in Zaire. But hardly a new building has gone up since independence and the infrastructure is collapsing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu appointed Kyungu as Shaba's governor four years ago as a pawn in his game to undermine the growing pressure for democratic rule. But in the climate of despair and resentment, Kyungu swiftly revived Shaba's secessionist tendencies, giving the province back its old name of Katanga. He launched a massive ethnic cleansing pogrom. About one million people with roots in neighbouring Kasai province were driven out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Asians in East Africa, the Kasaians are deeply resented in Shaba.  They dominated the civil service, management and business. When Kyungu ordered their explusion, the rest of Shaba's population was quick to seize their homes and loot their shops. Thousands of people were killed. Hundreds of thousands of others were forced on to trains to Kasai with no more than they could carry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyungu's rabid broadcasts denouncing Kasaians as parasites did much to fuel the violence. Today he paints a different picture of his role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;Most of those who went back to Kasai are those who didn't have work or places to stay. We had an internal conflict between different communities. These things won't happen again while I'm governor. We are turning the page.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethnic cleansing barely caused a stir beyond Shaba, but then the governor went too far even for Mobutu. He declared secession. The president placed him under house arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week Kyungu returns as governor declaring that secession is off the agenda. &quot;We can't even think of it. The world won't accept Katangan independence. We've had three wars over this and if we try it, we'll have another war. We have to talk about autonomy. With federalism, we can get everything we can get from independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kyungu may be right, for now. The failure of Shaba's people to grasp the present opportunity to declare an independent Katanga when the central government is in no position to prevent it suggests that the desire for secession has weakened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Mobutu's successors treat Shaba as dismissively as the ailing president, Kyungu's old battle cry of independence could find new voice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - According to a witness in the Zambian Supreme Court case to decide whether President Frederick Chiluba was eligible to be elected last November, Chiluba was expelled from school in the equivalent of standard seven for smoking marijuana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was one of the details about his personal life that have so far emerged in the trial, in which 56 witnesses are to appear. Only a handful have testified so far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties are challenging Chiluba's re-election, saying that his parents are not Zambian. According to the country's new Constitution, a person of foreign parentage is not eligible to stand for president. Former president Kenneth Kaunda was not allowed to contest last year's elections because his parents originally came from Malawi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the things that have come out in evidence given by prosecution witnesses are that Chiluba was expelled from Kawambwa Secondary School in the northern Lupula Province. Thomas Ngosa, a cousin of Chiluba's, said during the trial: &quot;He (Chiluba) went up to form two. They created some confusion with his friend Tom Musendeka because of dagga smoking and they were expelled.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba finished his high school education via correspondence, passing his O levels and one A level in political science.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngosa also testified that Chiluba was born at the Chibambo Mission in Zaire, contrary to his claims of having been born in Kitwe, a mining town in northern Zambia. Last year Richard Sakala, presidential press assistant, produced a video - Search for the Truth - about Chiluba's origins, in which he said Chibambo Mission didn't exist in 1944, the year Chiluba was born. But Ngosa claimed in court it existed long before that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luka Chabala, who has long claimed he is Chiluba's real father, said in court he made Chiluba's mother, Daina Kaimbe, pregnant outside wedlock. But her relatives would not allow him to marry her and harassed him. &quot;They could not allow me to marry her because I was short, jobless and poor. They threatened me, and I was forced to run away from Musangu village to Zaire,&quot; Chabala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chabala said he visited the village a few months after Chiluba was born, and Kaimbe secretly visited him so that he could see the baby. Kaimbe told him the child's name was Titus Mpundu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He didn't see his child again until 1980, when Chiluba was a trade unionist heading the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions. Chabala said they met in his home village, Musangu, several times. He said Chiluba, during those meetings, admitted that he knew he was his father. Chabala has said he is ready to take a DNA test to prove his claim. Chiluba has so far refused to take a such a test, but the court may order him to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After he had given evidence, Patrick Mvunga, one of the lawyers for the petitioners, asked Chabala to walk before the supreme court judges. Several people who were in the public gallery later said his gait and gestures were similar to Chiluba's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other witnesses testified that Chiluba has provided variations of his name to Zambia's authorities over the years. Charles Simufute, Zambia's deputy registrar general, said his office has no records of Frederick Jacob Titus Chiluba, which are the president's official names. &quot;I do not have records in those names,&quot; he said. Instead, the office only has the name Frederick Jacob Chiluba on record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barthlomew Tilase, supervising officer at the passport office and another witness, testified there were discrepancies in names on Chiluba's application forms for a passport in 1970 and 1974. Tilase said under normal legal procedures, Chiluba should have made a statutory declaration to change names legally. &quot;According to the records there was no such a statutory declaration made,&quot; he told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba has said in the past that his father, whose name he claims was &quot; Jacob Nkonde Chiluba&quot;, is now dead, and worked on the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines. But Eviristo Kambaila, president of the opposition National Congress Party and one of those to bring the petition against Chiluba, once worked as chief inspector for the company. He claims to have checked the mines records, and that the name &quot;Jacob Nkonde Chiluba&quot; does not appear at all.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Tangeni Amupadhi took a trip to Zion City Moria - along with three million worshippers of Africa's biggest church</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The masses who gathered at Zion City Moria, 40km from Pietersburg, last weekend, did not only pray and listen to the sermon of their leader, Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane. They also bought souvenirs and food, including Zion coffee and Zion tea from an official Zion Christian Church (ZCC)product line, on a scale which any large supermarket would envy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church's magazine - The ZCC Messenger, price R1,70 - may have pulled in more than R250 000 in advertising revenue alone, based on the R12 000 which one advertiser, a supermarket owner in nearby Tzaneen, says he paid for a full page.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, somebody made a lot of money from the ZCC's 87th annual gathering.  Moria has been the venue since 1947.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the church wasn't saying this week who it was. &quot;I will come back to you as soon as I get a reply,&quot; said secretary general Jhitsane Kutuane as he sought permission from the church's leaders to talk. &quot;It might be today, next week, next month ... it might be never.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although worshippers were not asked to pay entrance fees, boxes for &quot; donations&quot; were in abundance at the gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sex during the weekend is discouraged, as is eating - but tea and coffee endorsed by the church is readily available, at a price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little doubt that Moria serves as a lucrative business venue. The church says three million took part in this year's pilgrimage - out of a total following in Southern Africa of seven million. Founded by Edward Lekganyane in 1910, the ZCC is now the biggest independent church in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In between praying, singing and dancing, most pilgrims this year were buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Church-owned stores, stalls, and hawkers - also selling ZCC paraphernalia such as khaki uniforms and ties and also the Bible - were sprawled all over the holy village. At times, it could easily be mistaken for a flea-market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approved seller Godfrey Dikganeng from Botswana's Francistown gained permission from his ZCC congregation to sell holy knobkerries for R20 a piece.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Administrative problems and computer glitches have delayed the results of Census '96 by six months, and pushed costs beyond its R365- million budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary results from the population survey were first expected in January - then February, then March. Now, officials say it is too early even to tell when results may be ready, though they are aiming for sometime in &quot; the first half of the year&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Central Statistical Service (CSS) officials who ran the census have still to carry out the initial checks on the basic accuracy of the figures.  Outside observers say they are not expecting to see any results until June, with final data not expected until November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why the hell isn't it out yet?&quot; asked David Everatt, director of a social research non-governmental organisation, the Community Agency for Social Enquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CSS head Dr Mark Orkin says that despite the delay, he is comfortable with the rate of progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're certainly not going to compromise the integrity of the data by being hasty,&quot; he says. People are not harassing him for results, he says, although he recognises the need for speed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CSS chief director of demographic statistics, Pali Lehohla, says he is confident the results will contain a margin of error of less than 10%. The degree of accuracy is vital to develop effective policy decisions, particularly for rural areas and informal settlements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, previous censuses had margins of error of 15 to 20%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're feeling the pressure to have the results come out fairly fast,&quot; Lehohla says. &quot;But circumstances were beyond our control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those circumstances revolved largely around problems with transferring information electronically. First, the limited ability to send information led to enumerators - the people conducting the surveys in October and November - not getting paid on time. Administrators had to go back to manual operations before they could straighten out the problem by mid-January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then similar problems with sending data hampered the collection of census results. Officials have yet to determine whether data was lost due to the transferring problems, but Lehohla believes any loss was minimised by physically carrying census forms from dozens of regional offices to Pretoria to input the data into the CSS computers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That raw data, as well as data from a smaller survey conducted to cross- check the accuracy of the count, has now been collected, but it will take months to compile any results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delays will increase the costs of the census, but Lehohla believes this will be limited to &quot;some tens of thousands of rands&quot;. By far the greatest cost of conducting the census involved payment to enumerators, which will not rise because of the delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The census has been plagued with problems. There were questions about the hiring practice used to recruit the 100 000 enumerators, insufficient training, lack of access to certain areas, the inability to count some segments of the population, inconsistent collection of surveys, and concerns - particularly among some white respondents - that some questions on the survey could be biased against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But observers say the census was a far more comprehensive attempt at surveying the population than had been tried or accomplished before.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Hands up anyone who has never told a lie. No takers, eh!  That comes as no surprise. &quot;We are all liars,&quot; says Bob Sienaert. &quot;The purpose of education is to teach us how to lie and get away with it.'' He should know; his business is to catch liars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sienaert is a lie-detector man. Well, that is the generic term. More specifically, he is a polygraph expert, who insists that it's damn nigh impossible to get even the smallest fib past him and his machine. &quot;In just five minutes I can tell if someone is not telling me the truth. No one has ever beaten my polygraph test.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've told a few whoppers in my time: take the day I &quot;broke down&quot; hysterically and informed a policeman, who had stopped me for speeding, that my mother had been rushed to hospital. She is critical, I sobbed to the young motorcycle officer. I drove off with a lecture, but no ticket.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it was with a sense of anticipation that I walked up several flights of stairs in a shopping mall in Edenvale, near Johannesburg, on a grey afternoon and entered the offices of Tell Investigations to pit my skills against Sienaert the inquisitor. Surely a wily person with my intelligence could beat a hunk of metal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Actually, the brighter you are the easier it is to catch you out,&quot; he corrected. &quot;And a straight face is not worth a damn.&quot; I felt my confidence slip slightly. &quot;You really battle with a stupid person. That's why we don't test people of poor intelligence - or children,&quot; he continued. Apparently it has something to do with them not always knowing the difference between right and wrong, which might explain why, so far, the police service has been reluctant to subject its officers to the polygraph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undeterred, I took up the challenge. I had seen lie-detection machines on television, but Sienaert's equipment was not the chunky, dated contraption I had expected. It was a sophisticated set-up, comprising a laptop computer, a mini-printer and electronic attachments which he connected to my body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want you to write down a number from one to eight,&quot; said Sienaert, handing me paper and pen. It used to be up to 10, but some cheat once insisted he had written six, not nine, during a test. I sat down and prepared to confuse the machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sienaert explained that the principle, which is more than 100 years old, works on the subconscious and the parasympathetic nervous system. &quot;The machine listens to the answers your body gives to a question. It records lung function, picks up the pressure curve of the heart beat, blood volume'' and the sweatiness of one's hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Your subconscious listens to your conscious being and if it does not agree with your responses the machine will pick up the signals your body sends out as it becomes less relaxed ... Stress builds up as the intensity of the heartbeat changes, veins of the heart open to send blood through and breathing patterns change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of this is registered on the computer screen by a series of squiggly coloured lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So there I sat wired up as if for a medical: a blood pressure-type gadget wrapped around my arm, a stethoscope attached to my chest and another coiled around my waist. Velcro was used to attach electronic probes to two fingers on my left hand - to register my perspiration level, but according to Sienaert, I have the driest hands of any woman he has ever handled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the first series of simple questions to find out what number I had written down (I was told to answer no to them all) Sienaert accused me of not taking the test seriously. &quot;You are trying to fool the machine,&quot; he said. &quot;If this were real I would tell you that such attempted obstruction will be reported to the person who sent you here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was right. I had been thinking about, among other things, SEX! Yes, you've read correctly. And it worked as a distraction, thus giving inconsistently high readings on the polygraph. My deception was aided by the fact that, for a brief moment or two, I had also forgotten what number I had written on the paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next two tests (he usually does several before analysing the findings for consistent patterns) were my undoing. Even with my fertile imagination I was unable to keep up the fantasy. I was pegged; thank goodness my job was not on the line.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Tell Investigations's customers are companies seeking to screen prospective employees for sensitive positions or to find out if a member of staff has done something he or she is being accused of. They pay between R300 and R500 for the five-minute process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do a lot of work for parastatals like the Post Office, Telkom and Spoornet, to prevent bad people coming into the organisation,&quot; Sienaert told me. Take the guy who exaggerated his previous salary during his job interview from R3 000 to R10000 (does that ring any bells?) &quot;That's not embellishment ..  . it is a lie. It says this person is not of good character and should not be put in a position of trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This does not mean that people who pass the test will stay honest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sienaert also has many examples of clients sending employees to be tested for fraud allegations - say if money goes missing from a supermarket till and the cashier professes his or her innocence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was the case of the warehouse foreman accused of charging money for staff to work overtime. He was tested along with his three accusers and all failed. &quot;The charge was true, but two of the accusers had embellished their stories and one had lied outright to back them up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most unusual case was that of a couple in the grip of a bitter divorce and custody battle. The man had accused his wife of sexually molesting their young son and daughter. &quot;The advocates for both sides called me in and the couple agreed to be polygraphed.&quot; But surely the one who was lying would refuse to participate? &quot;It's about arrogance,&quot; suggested Sienaert.  &quot;People come here believing they can beat the machine because they get away with lying all the time.&quot; He found the husband's accusation to be false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sienaert, who immigrated from Belgium in the 1960s, is no Hercules Poirot.  With his bushy black eyebrows, mass of salt-and-pepper hair and beard, he looks more like a character from a Wagnerian opera. But he helps the police indirectly as the South African Police Service (SAPS) often asks companies to do their own pre-investigation before they open a docket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business is booming along with a growth in fraud and other white-collar crimes. &quot;Not that we are more crooked than any other nation,&quot; he insisted &quot;No one has a monopoly, but I get slightly more whites coming here because, in cases of fraud, there is still a preponderance of whites in management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Used mostly in the United States, polygraph testing was developed for the military during World War II. It was revived in the 1970s and is now regularly used to test some US government employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process is relatively new to South Africa because of the boycott years, but there are now about five companies offering the service and the SAPS is said to have its own polygraph gathering dust at headquarters in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sienaert, an electrical engineer, has not always been a fan of polygraph testing. &quot;At first I was very sceptical, but it was difficult to argue with the positive results.&quot; He liked it so much that he bought the business last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a long way from working at Nasa's deep-space tracking station in Hartebeeshoek in the years before sanctions. When he graduated from the National Radio Institute in Brussels in the 1960s his dream was to become head of a laboratory. He did research work on alternative energy for Siemens Electronics before leaving in 1992 to work for Telkom, where he was made redundant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was while acting as a consultant with a firm providing security for parastatals and big companies that he made the switch to lie-detection. &quot;You can put in all the security you want, but in the end it is down to people.  Anyone has a price and many people get low salaries so can be bribed easily to turn a blind eye; most major crimes require insider help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he would not say exactly how many subjects pass his way every week (only that it is a constant flow) Sienaert estimates that more than 1000 tests are done across the country each month. &quot;If the test is inconclusive, then it goes in favour of the person taking it. About 85% are a clear yes or no; 10% will give an explanation and 5% are not co-operative or don't know - maybe three or four in 100 are inconclusive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If crime continues to soar, lie-detecting could be a growth industry - &quot;but not something that will explode,&quot; said Sienaert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has limited application because basically we still take people at their word and it is only in special circumstances that a company will resort to subjecting workers to the polygraph.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The war between Cape Town's drug lords and People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) is heading for the ballot box. Notorious gangster Rashied Staggie has announced that he will contest the 1999 elections, while Pagad is said to be forming a political party for the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staggie, the twin brother of Rashaad Staggie who was slain by Pagad members last year, is a member of the newly formed party for coloured people, Die Suid-Afrikaan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party is an extension of the Community Outreach Forum (Core), which was formed in 1996 by pastor Albern Martins to &quot;provide a haven for reformed gangsters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martins told a meeting in Ladysmith last weekend that &quot;the coloured people of South Africa should take back the country. We are the only ones that are left out and even the blacks have a say in the country now,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad's national commander, Aslam Toeffy, told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that his organisation sees Core and Die Suid-Afrikaan as &quot;institutions which aim to further drug smuggling in the Western Cape&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He remains &quot;convinced&quot; that Staggie still trades in drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At this stage we do not want to comment on the new party, but it consists of gangsters like Martins and Staggie who will never mend their ways,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martins denied accommodating gangsters, but said &quot;we will fight Pagad because their struggle is a futile one&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that Staggie &quot;will definitely be a member of the new party and he will contest the next elections. Why should there be a problem if ex- gangsters want to become members of Parliament?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked whether he was aware that Staggie has previously admitted to &quot;killing men with my bare hands&quot;, he said: &quot;That is a thing of the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toeffy said this week that Pagad has no official policy about forming a political party to counter the aims of Die Suid-Afrikaan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did say, however, that the organisation &quot;will do everything necessary to stop the gangsterism of Staggie and Martins&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town criminologist Don Pinnock says that Pagad aims to contest the 1999 elections and he believes it is currently &quot;forming political alliances with the aim of establishing a political party&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this is so, Die Suid-Afrikaan and Pagad could be on the same ballot paper in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, Pagad and the gangsters remain committed to a struggle that frequently results in violence. In the latest outbreak, the house of ex-Pagad leader Nadthmie Edries in Cape Town's Primrose Park was bombed on Tuesday by suspected gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack followed several the previous week by gangsters on the homes of Pagad members. There was also an attack on Staggie's house in Sea Point.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Mail &amp; Guardian and the Freedom of Expression Institute have instituted legal proceedings against the SANDF in an attempt to open a Cape court martial to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff Sergeant Herman Phieffer and Corporal Desmond Booysen have been charged with alleging that their commanding officer was racist and with leaking sensitive information to a military intelligence officer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two, who are based at Group 31 battalion in Paarl, had been asked to help with an intelligence investigation into alleged arms smuggling in the Western Cape. A military intelligence report was declassified and used as evidence at the court martial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It later emerged at the court martial that in an attempt to build a case against the two outspoken soldiers, the contents of the intelligence document were revealed to their commanding officer, Colonel Pat McLoughlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two soldiers allegedly told the intelligence officer they believed McLoughlin did not support the integration of the SANDF and believed members of non-statutory armies were not suited to serve in the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court martial began in Paarl last December and resumes on April 7. The M&amp;G's attorneys David Dison, Norval and Wheeldon, will appear at the court martial to apply for it to be heard in an open court and for the public to be granted access. They will also apply for public access to all documents relevant to the court martial, including the military intelligence report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application will be based on the provisions of the Constitution which guarantees that everyone has a right to a fair public hearing in a court or any other appropriate forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should the application fail, the lawyers will consider approaching a higher court for relief, the lawyers said in a letter to the SANDF.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The most senior members of the ANC's former liberation army, Umkhonto weSizwe, are mobilising against racism in the SANDF, reports Rehana Rossouw</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DEPUTY Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils has acknowledged there is racism in the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and has extended his sympathies to lower-ranking soldiers who are victims of discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian is in possession of a document drawn up by a former Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) officer, Brigadier Johannes Mudimu, titled &quot;Back to the Drawing Board&quot;, which he has circulated to senior MK officers in the SANDF for &quot;action&quot;. Mudimu heads the MK Integration Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lists 41 questions which reflect growing frustration among former MK members with the transformation of the SANDF and the integration of non- statutory armed forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a pointer to the daily hardships faced by former combatants, Mudimu asks what will be done about commanding officers in the defence force who &quot; perpetrate discrimination and preach how inferior the members of the non- statutory forces are&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Haven't we personally experienced such abuses? Haven't we experienced insults that send shivers down our spines, insults that call for action? What about an avalanche of courts martial? Have we lost our revolutionary zeal to fight injustice no matter from whatever quarter it comes?&quot; he asks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are we committed towards establishing a climate for a properly integrated SANDF? Is there a sense among us of truly transforming the defence force in order to ensure we can identify with it? Are we comfortable with the way the old South African Defence Force (SADF) is addressing issues of integration and rationalisation?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudimu asks his fellow MK leaders whether they have the capacity to intervene and change the ethos of the old SADF. He also asks whether they have any influence at &quot;operational&quot; and &quot;tactical&quot; levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document, dated February 19, was sent to Lieutenant General Siphiwe Nyanda, Lieutenant General LS Moloi, Major General Andrew Masondo, Major General P Tshikare, Major General N Ngwenya, Major General DJ Aboobaker, Major General FR Sedibe-Mdluli, Brigadier MJ Motau and Brigadier P Mokonopi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mudimu would not comment this week, saying he was not prepared to communicate with &quot;his people&quot; via newspapers. He did say, however, that it might be necessary for former MK leaders to meet to discuss these issues and ensure mechanisms were put in place so that soldiers &quot;on the ground&quot; knew there was an attempt being made to solve their problems. There are 14 000 members of former non-statutory armed forces integrated into the SANDF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasrils said Mudimu's initiative was &quot;far from a rebellion&quot; and had the Ministry of Defence's wholehearted blessings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Obviously I accept that there are complaints and perspectives that the SANDF is racist and that transformation has not proceeded smoothly. The Ministry of Defence is on the warpath against racism and gender prejudice and has done a lot to combat it,&quot; Kasrils said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Brigadier Mudimu's integration committee is part of the Department of Defence ... the committee is made up of former MK members who have every right to discuss these problems and issues and who should have been more active in tackling them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The integration committee is a key structure put in place by agreement before integration. I will concede that they haven't perhaps acted actively enough to investigate problems and find solutions to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasrils said Mudimu's document was meant to be an internal review, taking stock of the situation and informing the defence command council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was drafted before some very important changes were made. The ministry has in recent months transferred the accounting and head of department function from the chief of the defence force to the defence secretariat, ensuring civilian control over these very important functions,&quot; Kasrils said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have also restructured and rationalised the top management of the SANDF.  We have announced 28 new appointments, half of them former MK people. There are also some outstanding white officers who have been promoted, officers who have shown they are positive about transformation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MK members who have been promoted include Lieutenant General Nyanda as deputy chief of the SANDF, Major General Gilbert Ramano as army deputy chief and Major General Thamba Masuku as head of medical services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the same time I am sympathetic to those who believe they experience day- to-day racism in the SANDF,&quot; Kasrils said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Minister and I have spoken to the defence force chiefs and emphasised the need for them to be positive about transformation and to eradicate racism.  But it takes time to change a mindset.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - State-owned port operator Portnet has donated taxpayers' money to Durban's top cultural centre in a mysterious deal arranged by a former member of Umkhonto we Sizwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bartel Arts Trust (BAT) says it still has to establish where it is supposed to invest the R50 000 it received in February from Portnet's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) fund. The BAT centre merely leases space to privately run business.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Portnet's Durban port RDP co-ordinator Ali Phosa, brother of Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa, says the donation is a pre-payment for services, such as functions, for the port's workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa's partner in arranging the donation is ex-MK soldier Sipho &quot;Mandla&quot; Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sithole is not a Portnet employee and his relationship to the organisation is unclear. Portnet employees say Sithole is working with the port's head of security, Andre Welgemoed, which Welgemoed confirms. Phosa says he knows nothing about Sithole's work for Welgemoed, and that he is merely helping with the BAT project. Speaking from Welgemoed's office, Sithole said he had &quot; nothing to say to journalists&quot; and referred all queries to BAT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The curious saga follows in the wake of an internal investigation into Phosa's alleged mismanagement of R500 000 in RDP funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAT centre manager Phillipa Huntly says she has asked Sithole and Phosa to explain what the money was for. &quot;I don't think they understood that they can't invest in the centre, because we are a trust.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phosa says several options are still being considered for the money, although it had already been paid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huntly says there have been talks with port manager Bax Nomvete and the centre's trustees over a potential donation, but says a cultural centre is an &quot;odd&quot; place to spend RDP money. Nomvete has recently been appointed as a centre trustee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nomvete says he has not yet &quot;legally&quot; become a trustee, though he has been offered the post. He defends the investment, saying &quot;The BAT Centre does some RDP programmes&quot;. However, he adds that he knows nothing about Sithole's involvement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Johannesburg child protection unit has failed to act on a seemingly watertight case, reports Stuart Hess</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE stands on a Hillbrow street corner, selling sweets to children. To the unsuspecting, Isaac Tshipe is just another street vendor; but to four-year- old Thembi (not her real name) he is the man who raped and assaulted her one night in a local hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five witnesses have identified Tshipe as the paedophile rapist - one says he saw him on top of the child. He denies the accusations. But Tshipe's neighbour, who wants to remain anonymous, says Tshipe regularly takes girls to his room at the nearby Fairmont Hotel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thembi's story, which the Mail &amp; Guardian told last month, was handed on a plate to the Johannesburg child protection unit (CPU) office last October by South African Stop Child Abuse (Sasca), a child welfare agency. A medical report was later added to the docket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, the unit was also offered a taped confession, extracted from Tshipe minutes after he was pulled off the girl by Sasca officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In it, he says: &quot;I was having sex with her. Don't hurt me, don't hurt me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sergeant Herbert Mntambo, who is investigating Thembi's case for the CPU, said he was &quot;not interested&quot; in the tape when the M&amp;G offered it to him this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CPU's reluctance contrasts sharply with its normal stance - that it is virtually powerless to combat child abuse, because it is understaffed or underpaid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Sasca officials had found Tshipe with the girl at the Diplomat Hotel in Johannesburg, they took him to the police headquarters at John Vorster Square, where they laid a charge against him, and handed over a copy of the taped confession. He was released soon afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mntambo said he could not act because he did not &quot;have a statement from the victim and the hospital has not sent us a medical report&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had not made further inquiries about the case since February. He said he would immediately contact the doctor to obtain the medical report but added: &quot; I doubt very much if your case will proceed. You must not make this investigation more difficult than it already is.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district surgeon at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, Dr Thamsanqa Mbovane, said in his statement: &quot;The child was definitely penetrated.&quot; This statement is attached to the docket sitting on Mntambo's desk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thembi's mother, who sells beer in Hillbrow, sold her child for sex for R200 a time. The child endured several &quot;customers&quot; from last January until September, when Sasca found her. She is still receiving psychiatric and medical treatment - for injuries to her genitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This scenario is typical of the CPU. They will not act unless a social worker or the media persistently phone them,&quot; Sasca president Tutu Mgulwa says. &quot;If this happens with one case what happens to the many others which nobody inquires about?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glenys van Halter, the co-ordinator for anti-child abuse group Children in Violence, said CPU dockets were often lost. &quot;They are not making an effort to fight child abuse, they are dragging their feet,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was announced this week that the CPU will enjoy a budget increase of R2, 25-million to R19,25-million - a 13,2% rise - for its 1997/98 financial year.  Latest CPU figures, however, show the growth in its caseload far outstrips its budget gains. It dealt with nearly 36 000 cases of child abuse last year, more than double the number for 1993, with rape cases rising nearly 40% on the 1995 figure to 13 859 incidents, and sodomy cases jumping more than 35%.  And those are just the cases reported.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government's finance watchdog has provided a glimpse of the apparently pampered life of the nation's spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the South African Secret Services (SASS) agents enjoy plush, furnished accommodation. Employees have also allegedly been leasing their own properties to their agencies, and there are plans for a special clinic for spies. The two agencies together spent more than R26-million on health care for their members in the 1995/96 financial year - 4% of their R671,2-million expenditure for the year.The NIA also spent R5-million on an undisclosed &quot;asset&quot; in 1995, which has been underused since.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The findings form part of the auditor general's annual report on government finances, tabled last week in Parliament. Auditor General Henri Kluever again disclosed poor financial controls across government, leading to unauthorised expenditure of more than R150-million and raising serious doubts about how closely government officials follow rules such as going to the State Tender Board before spending public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Intelligence Ministry refused to respond to questions arising from the report, saying all would be revealed in the budget speech of Deputy Minister of Intelligence Services Joe Nhlanhla later this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kluever mentions, however, that R96-million has been spent so far on the NIA's new office complex, and that a further audit was due of the 1996/97 financial year to check whether the R5-million asset had started to pay its way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the time of compiling the report, the matter was being attended to,&quot; Kluever noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secrecy of the intelligence expenditure has always been a sore point for taxpayers, who fear that their money might be wasted under the cloaks of covert operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kluever has not shied away from pointing out problems which have cropped up in the department's books. The amalgamation of the services of former homelands with the national services has been especially expensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cost of furnished accommodation which was hired to accommodate members transferred appeared excessive,&quot; the report notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Considerable amounts in respect of rentals were apparently overpaid. It was furthermore determined that members of the NIA and the SASS were in certain instances the undisclosed owners of properties rented to the agency ..  . These findings are indicative of a total lack of internal control which could have resulted in irregular payments.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The British mercenary company which subcontracted South Africa's Executive Outcomes to crush a rebellion on Papua New Guinea's island province Bougainville asked for a stake in the large Panguna copper mine after its recapture, a judicial inquiry was told this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Counsel assisting the commission, which is probing the ill-fated contract between the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government and Sandline International - which subcontracted the South Africans - presented a letter where Sandline chief Tim Spicer outlined the offer to the PNG defence minister, according to agency reports from Australia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It included a joint venture between the PNG government, Sandline and British-Australian mining giant RTZ-CRA to run the mine &quot;once recovered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Panguna copper mine, on Bougainville, was forced to close in 1989 after a dispute over royalties from the mine started the secessionist conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Spicer and PNG Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan, who has been suspended pending the outcome of the inquiry, denied Sandline would have had any interest in the mine under the mercenary contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In evidence this week, Spicer told the inquiry Sandline had never shown any interest in the mine as part of negotiations for the US$36-milion contract with PNG. Executive Outcomes itself has on a number of occasions denied governments paid for services rendered by itself through mineral concessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, chaired by Australian Judge Warwick Andrew, also received documents outlining senior PNG bureaucrats' concerns with Sandline's corporate links and its operating methods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sandline inquiry was ordered by Chan under mounting political and military pressure after sacked army commander Jerry Singirok last month labelled the contract corrupt.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN Polish immigrant Janusz Waluz was arrested shortly after he gunned down Chris Hani, his only words were that the murder weapon - found in his getaway car - had been &quot;planted&quot;. After that he maintained a stony silence which he kept up throughout his trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next Thursday, April 10, South Africans will mourn the fourth anniversary of Hani's death. But for many, four years and the lifelong imprisonment of Waluz and his rightwing co-conspirator, Clive Derby-Lewis, have not put the South African Communist Party (SACP) leader's ghost to rest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now evidence suggests that Waluz may not have been the only gunman at Hani's Boksburg home that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">April 10, 1993: journalist Jon Qwelane, who lived down the road from Hani, visits the assassination scene. He hears that United Nations observers, also there, are talking of more than one type of ammunition cartridge found. No such evidence was presented in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the African National Congress intelligence supremo, Joe Nhlanhla, also arrives at the scene. Behind a neighbour's wall he finds a softdrink tin and two cigarette stubs. An apparent bullet hole next to Hani's garage, consistent with a shot having been fired from beyond the neighbour's wall, raises Nhlanhla's suspicions of a second gunman. The hole was never proved to have been from a gunshot, but some senior former ANC intelligence operatives still believe there was something to it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hani drew the attention of apartheid's intelligence agencies more than most of his comrades. He survived a number of assassination attempts both in exile and after his return to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A September 1992 intelligence report composed by Jan Anton Nieuwoudt of Military Intelligence's (MI) notorious Directorate of Covert Collection (DCC), claimed that a serious split was developing between Joe Modise, now minister of defence, and Hani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It suggests that an &quot;approach&quot; be made to Modise. There is no evidence that this actually happened, and Modise has denied it - but ominously Nieuwoudt talks of the &quot;exploitation of the split&quot; and about a &quot;final phase to this goal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early April 1993 Eugene Riley, a former agent of the South African Defence Force's equally notorious Civil Co-operation Bureau (CCB), and who later appears to have forged links with Nieuwoudt's DCC like many of his colleagues, entered the fray. In intelligence reports he made to the then National Intelligence Service (NIS), he warned of the impending assassination, putting the blame on ANC operatives. He cited internal ANC squabbles and Hani's &quot;own agenda&quot; as the motive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the documents, Riley claimed his information had come from &quot;Ramon&quot;, whom he described as an ANC intelligence operative. The M&amp;G has named Ramon as Mohammed Amin Laher. The ANC has said it could find no record of Laher having worked for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laher has claimed to the M&amp;G that the assassination was a joint project by &quot; both sides of the spectrum&quot;. Riley died in an unsolved shooting in early 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there is no hard evidence that the information contained in the Riley documents was accurate - except for the date of the planned assassination and a reference to &quot;a Polish member of the strike unit&quot; - the fact that he prepared them for the NIS establishes an interesting link. There have been allegations that right-wing journalist Arthur Kemp, a former security policeman who testified in Waluz and Derby Lewis's trial that he had supplied the addresses for the &quot;hit list&quot; that identified Hani, had been an informer for the NIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp, who was initially arrested after the assassination, but not prosecuted in exchange for turning state witness, has denied he had worked for the NIS. But he nevertheless offered to sell the London Sunday Times a story on the &quot;wider conspiracy&quot; for Pounds 100 000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A document Riley composed for the NIS on May 15 1993 warns of a plot to assassinate SACP leader Joe Slovo. Again quoting &quot;Ramon&quot; as the source, it claims that the same &quot;Omega Strike Unit&quot; of the ANC that killed Hani would be used to assassinate Slovo. Again, there appears to be some truth, although there is no proof that the attempt would have been ANC-inspired. Not long after Hani's death, a &quot;right-wing&quot; plot was indeed uncovered to assassinate Slovo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the leader of the &quot;strike unit&quot; and the senior ANC security operative who, according to the document, would have ordered the assassination, are identified in the document by their ANC noms de guerre. The M&amp;G this week traced the &quot;leader of the strike unit&quot; - an ex-special forces soldier who joined the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted having known Riley and still having contact with Riley's CCB colleague Ferdie Barnard, but said the document contained &quot;disinformation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But last week the spotlight again swung away from possible ANC involvement.  An intelligence report prepared last month for the National Intelligence Agency (NIA), successor to the NIS, was leaked to the weekly New Nation. It alleges the &quot;second gunman&quot; was in the employ of a private security firm on the East Rand, which gave him a perfect excuse to monitor Hani's house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would have been commanded by a senior ex-MI member, and would have been friends with a member of the Boksburg City Council civil defence department who, it is claimed, tried to have the police release Waluz immediately after his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G has been able to establish the names of the security firm and the three people referred to. The security firm employee this week denied he had anything to do with the plot, but acknowledged being friends with the former MI member and the civil defence department member, as indicated in the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the M&amp;G has been unable to verify the attempt to have Waluz released, two other incidents described in the NIA report have been corroborated. The report claims the same security firm employee had planned to sabotage Shereno Printers near Boksburg, which printed ANC publicity material, but that it was aborted when the printers were warned. It also claims the employee had entered Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's house to assassinate her, but that he left when then ANC Youth League leader Peter Mokaba entered her house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G this week established Shereno Printers had indeed been warned they would be sabotaged, while Mokaba confirmed the incident at Madikizela- Mandela's house. In neither case, though, could it be established whether the security firm employee had been the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The web grows more intricate. But to what extent the allegations surfacing now are the truth - and to what extent they may be attempts to use an emotive subject for a quick political buck - remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Legal Aid Board has accepted most of the flood of applications stemming from the constitutional clause which offers state- sponsored legal representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A board official, Peter Brits, said this week that the board had accepted 115 000 out of about 125 000 applications in the 12 months to March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acceptance rate came despite a &quot;relatively complicated&quot; screening process, and, on top of &quot;normal&quot; legal aid, lifted the board's total pay-out to R93-million in the year to March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Constitution says citizens have the right &quot;to have a legal aid practitioner assigned to the accused by the state, and at state expense, if substantial injustice would otherwise result, and to be informed of this right&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board, which last week defended itself in Parliament against allegations of mismanagement, was asked by the Justice Ministry in March 1995 to handle applications flowing from the clause. It set up its constitutional legal aid screening scheme a month later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johannesburg High Court will next week hear the case of a hijacker sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment who was refused state-backed legal representation. It will be argued that he was not informed of his right to the representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Setsetse, spokesman for Justice Minister Dullah Omar, said that a Legal Aid Amendment Bill would be placed before Parliament to formalise the Legal Aid Board's position as the state's agent for screening applications under the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Board director Nic Pretorius told the parliamentary justice committee that the organisation was not mismanaged, but that it suffered from a shortage of staff. He had applied to the State Expenditure Department in May 1995 for funds for 77 new posts, but was given only 40.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If Eugene de Kock were to be tried now, taxpayers would not have to face footing his legal bills, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAFETY and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi plans to pull the plug on taxpayers paying for lawyers to defend policemen charged with involvement in &quot; third force&quot; activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in his secretariat said this week they were preparing to end state support for third force killers - a practice which has sucked up millions of rands of taxpayers' money paid out of the police budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trial of former Vlakplaas killer Eugene de Kock alone cost the taxpayer R5,8-million, while the &quot;Motherwell&quot; trial cost R2,5-million. The Legal Aid Board's total pay-out to defend civilian criminals last year was R93-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A secretariat official said the onus would be on George Fivaz, the national commissioner of police, to investigate whether police officers facing prosecution had been involved in third force activities. Until now the police have paid out if their officer was held to have acted in the course of his duties. According to the present rules, a member will not be paid out if he acted recklessly or wilfully or under the influence of drugs or alcohol - a set of qualifications which De Kock, for example, managed to slip through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials said the new policy was intended to &quot;inculcate a new style of litigation which will involve full investigation to determine which cases have merit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretariat was also anxious to change the choice of lawyers usually selected to handle police matters. In many instances the same lawyers who represented the police under the old government have been selected by bureaucrats handling police litigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi has at least twice ordered police to settle matters that were not worth fighting. In one instance, the police were ordered to withdraw an appeal against a R188 000 damages award to a former Umkhonto weSizwe operative who was brutally tortured for several weeks. The safety and security secretary, Azhar Cachalia, spoke at the time of the need to stop &quot; knee-jerk denials of human rights abuses&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army has apparently yet to embrace a third force legal policy - despite the fact that taxpayers paid out R7,25-million last year for the KwaMakutha case in which the former defence minister, Magnus Malan, was acquitted of running a death squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A South African National Defence Force spokesman said state cover was provided &quot;on the basis that the person was actually in service and was acting within the course and scope of the individual's employment as an officer of the state&quot;. The official said it was up to the state attorney to decide whether &quot;a member has forfeited his cover&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was too early to say how much the army had spent on legal fees in the last financial year. In the 1995/6 financial year it had paid out R2,7- million. The defence force did not budget for legal defence costs and so was unable to give a projection for the coming year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, it has emerged that the Legal Aid Board is funding some of the individual members of the Inkatha Freedom Party due to appear before a commission of inquiry into the 1994 Shell House massacre which starts next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Legal Aid Board senior official, Peter Brits, said that although the individuals were being funded, the board as a rule did not fund political parties and so was not backing the IFP itself. The IFP has, however, previously applied for legal aid. It asked for state funding during the commission of inquiry into mine violence at several Goldfields mines last year, but was turned down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFP and its individuals involved in the Shell House inquiry before Judge Robert Nugent will be represented by six legal teams. The African National Congress's members will be represented by one team, comprising one attorney and four advocates.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The construction of expensive and environmentally damaging dams - and new inter-catchment transfer schemes like the controversial Lesotho Highlands Project - could be postponed by revolutionary water-saving measures contained in municipal regulations to be introduced across the country this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed Israeli-style regulations, some of them so dramatic they were considered an April Fool's joke when reported this week, are part of a package designed to ensure South Africa uses water supplies efficiently and in a way that provides the poorest with a supply of potable water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The by-laws, outlined in the proposed national water supply regulations, aim to dramatically cut the water consumed by municipal users, including mines, farmers, municipalities and citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We urgently need to change people's behaviour from a free-and-easy approach of using as much water as they like, to one which balances consumption with availability of a scarce resource,&quot; said Neil MacLeod, chairman of the National Water Regulations Drafting Committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacLeod estimated that within 30 years the amount of water available to each person in South Africa - an arid country despite the fact that the resource here is still among the cheapest in the world - would have to be halved to about 650 litres a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new and standardised regulations, designed to help meet the cuts required to achieve this, are set to become law within months. They include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A ban on watering gardens, sportsfields or lawns between 1am and 3pm between the months of October and March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">l A complete and nationwide ban on the use of high-pressure hoses to clean pavements and other hardened surfaces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* An embargo on the installation of lavatory cisterns with a capacity greater than nine litres. All new toilets will be fitted with dual flushing devices so that less water can be used to flush liquids only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All new shower heads will have a maximum flow rate of less than 10 litres a minute. Efforts will be made to replace old shower heads and cisterns with new water-saving technologies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All car washes will have to be done in a way that ensures 70% of water is recycled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local authorities will also be required to conduct an annual water audit to establish consumption and losses to leaking pipes and illegal connections. In places like Soweto and other apartheid townships, up to 50% of water supplies are lost due to leakages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're an arid country, compared with Israel, and these regulations are the first step in a national process to conserve water. In about five years we will have to introduce stringent regulations, such as tariff hikes and compelling people to fit water-saving devices,&quot; said MacLeod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 10 years we will probably have the same regulations as Israel, where even the type of applications used in the home are regulated, and the type of plants one can grow in gardens is controlled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumers have reacted with some degree of shock, but senior officials in the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry said the real significance of the regulations lay in their potential to prevent the need for new expensive and destructive dam projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Results from measures adopted by the Hermanus municipality in the Western Cape showed that local consumption could be reduced by 30% in months, said Guy Preston, special adviser to Minister of Water Affairs and Forestry Kader Asmal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half the measures contained in a 12-point water conservation plan - including informative billing that shows consumers how much they use, intensive communication with residents and an escalating tariff on a &quot;more- you-use-more-you-pay&quot; basis - has led to a 30% saving in the municipality in the last four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has been achieved by implementing half the proposed programme. Once the other measures are put in place, Hermanus can expect to save even more water,&quot; said Preston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He estimates such savings, if adopted by Cape Town, will allow the city to delay building new dams and that the total saving to the local government and its ratepayers would thus amount to some R780-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If local Gauteng authorities adopted similar measures - and they will be encouraged to do so by the restrictions and audit obligations contained in the proposed regulations - the savings in terms of dam construction costs would run to billions of rands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department officials were reluctant to speculate yet about the possibility that the new measures would reduce the need for Gauteng to draw water from the Lesotho Highlands Project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the success of Asmal's conservation campaign - described by American experts recently as &quot;unprecedented in terms of approach and effectiveness&quot; - has raised questions about the future of conventional engineering approaches to water shortage in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Morals have no role to play in the drive for trade, report Marion Edmunds and Carien du Plessis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA'S international trade is being buoyed by soaring business with some of the world's leading violators of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latest figures show South Africa is enjoying much of its strongest growth in exports and imports from trade with the likes of Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Saudi Arabia and Iran - all renowned for repressive policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures, released this week by the Department of Trade and Industry, underline the government's dilemma in trying to define foreign and trade policies which square South Africa's new-found human rights drive with economic reality. &quot;Human rights are worked into the thinking,&quot; a department spokesman says. &quot;But it is sometimes difficult to reconcile these with the needs of South African citizens.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Foreign Affairs has raised the issue with the Foreign Affairs Department. It is still awaiting a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs officials were unavailable this week, and no one was available from the offices of President Nelson Mandela, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad - the three key players behind South Africa's foreign affairs policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures show South Africa's top trading partners in volume remain countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in terms of year-on-year growth, trade with more oppressive nations is ballooning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's total trade with Iran last year was R5,7-billion, compared to less than R23-million in 1993. The growth can be partially pinned on the reclassification of oil imports, following the lifting of apartheid-linked trade barriers - imports from Iran were R5,3-billion last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the growth is not all oil-related. South Africa's exports there jumped nearly 200% from the 1995 level to R422,5-million. In 1993 the figure was less than R6-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iran's human rights record includes detaining thousands of political prisoners, and punishing offenders by flogging, amputation or execution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi Arabia, which operates a similarly harsh penal system, is also proving a lucrative trading partner for South Africa. It bought South African goods worth R364-million last year, while its exports here were R942,8- million. Total trade in 1993 was less than R360-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaysia, rapidly emerging as one of the top investors in South Africa, lifted sales here nearly 25% last year to R1,3-billion, and bought South African goods worth R750,3-million. Trade last year was more than three times the level in 1993. Malaysia is known for its harsh judicial and penal system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Korea, named this week by the International Labour Organisation as one of the world's leading infringers of labour rights, has seen trade with South Africa jump from a little over R2-billion in 1993 to more than R5,6- billion last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade with China was R3,6-billion last year, compared to R1,6-billion in 1993. Business with China is expected to boom further, given South Africa's decision to break off full relations with Taiwan. China's human rights violations include detaining thousands of political prisoners and torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade with India, where the police are known to have a heavy hand, has doubled in the past three years, while trade between South Africa and Indonesia last year was four times its 1993 value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African trade is also soaring with Syria, Nigeria, Sudan and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary portfolio committee chairman Raymond Suttner says the issue is &quot;deeply complex ... In regard to Nigeria, I would support a trade boycott but we need to ask ourselves how effective this is since we do not appear to have the support of most other states of Africa. That raises the problem of wanting to do something and needing to do it multilaterally in a continental situation that is not favourably disposed to taking up human rights situations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa should do its own study of the human rights abuses in China before taking decisions that might impact on relations, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other observers say it is clear South Africa's economic needs are taking priority over the problems of the repressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a government now that gives a commitment to human rights, but we are ignoring what the countries we trade with do to their own people,&quot; Human Rights Committee chairman Jeremy Sarkin says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of deals with rights abusers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Iran: Total trade has grown more than 25 000% since 1993, and last year stood at R5,7-billion. Main South African exports include cereals, iron, steel and machinery including nuclear equipment. Main imports are oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty International says Iranian authorities detain thousands of political prisoners, and often punishes offenders by public flogging, amputations and executions. In one instance last September a bride and her sister were sentenced to 85 and 75 lashes respectively for dancing with men at a wedding, and another 127 guests were sentenced to lashes or fines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Saudi Arabia: Total trade was R1,3-billion last year, 277% higher than in 1993. Oil and its by-products are the main imports, while South Africa's main exports are fruit and nuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Saudi Arabians also believe in public floggings and amputations, while political prisoners have alleged ill-treatment including beating the soles of feet and electric shocks, particularly around the genitals. Trade unions and opposition parties are banned, while human rights activists are harassed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Malaysia: Trade was R2,1-billion last year, compared to R609-million in 1993. South Africa's exports include precious stones and cereals, and Malaysia is selling us animal and vegetable fat and rubber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White collar criminals, drug offenders, rapists, kidnappers and robbers can all expect to be caned as part of their punishment in Malaysia. Under the country's Internal Security Act, the government can detain anyone suspected of threatening national security for up to two years, without charge or trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Indonesia: Total trade has risen 319% in three years to R1,3-billion last year. Main exports here are rubber, coffee and tea. We sell them wood, iron and steel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty says Indonesian authorities restrict civil liberties and harass government critics and human rights activists, banning publications that might contain criticism. It has cracked down on dissidents in East Timor who are seeking independence and arrested scores of activists. Torture and other ill-treatment of suspects is common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* India: Trade has jumped nearly 800% in three years, to R2,3-billion last year. We import hides, skins, and textiles. India buys South Africa's iron and steel, wood and chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Detainees, either criminal or political, can expect to be tortured as the Indian police and military strive to extract information and confessions - beatings, hanging by the wrists or ankles and electric shocks are not unusual.  For women prisoners, rape by their guards is common.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* China: Trade last year with this country was R3,6-billion, R2-billion more than in 1993. China's main exports here are cheap shoes and electrical goods. They buy South African ores, vehicles and copper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven years after Tiananmen Square, China looks no more favourably on basic human rights, detaining thousands of political prisoners a year and routinely torturing them. The rights of the accused to adequate defence are severely limited, and many of those prisoners that aren't shot eke out their sentence in &quot;labour&quot; camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Zaireans arrive for bosberaad</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African government is hoping to create a &quot;bosberaad&quot; atmosphere for the two Zairean delegations which flew into Gauteng on Thursday for talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Foreign Affairs, which is organising the meeting, threw a blanket of secrecy over the arrival of the rebel alliance delegation, representing their leader Laurent Kabila, and the group representing President Mobutu Sese Seko, which was expected to arrive on a separate plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will probably meet at a venue in Pretoria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu's representatives include the Zairean foreign minister, representatives of political parties, the military and judiciary, and Mobutu's special political and security advisers. It was not clear on Thursday whether Zaire's newly appointed Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi would be among the delegation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabila has sent four men, who have been using the media this week to get across their viewpoint that their main aim in the talks is to discuss Mobutu's resignation and a safe place for him to spend his final days, far from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations will be chaired by Mohamed Sahnoun, United Nations and Organisation of African Unity special envoy. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Aziz Pahad met Sahnoun on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAC hearing goes ahead</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pan Africanist Congress decided on Thursday to continue with a disciplinary hearing of its former president, Clarence Makwetu, although he did not arrive for it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is accused of dividing the party, creating factions and denying the new leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makwetu was ousted as PAC president by former Methodist Bishop Stanley Mogoba at the organisation's national conference in December. He then disobeyed a request from the party's leadership to step down as an MP to make way for Mogoba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disciplinary hearing was scheduled to begin at 10am on Thursday, but when Makwetu had not arrived by noon, the committee decided to go ahead in his absence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will continue with or without him,&quot; said Mogole Mphanhlele, who is serving as prosecutor in the hearing. &quot;A decision will definitely be taken on Makwetu's position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advocates get out of town</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johannesburg Bar has lifted the ban on advocates having chambers outside Innes and Schreiner chambers, two buildings opposite the High Court in central Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bar Council ruled last week that members could now operate full-time chambers in Sandton, providing they also share a base with other advocates in the city centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bar has until now resisted allowing advocates to quit the city centre to ensure that the clubby institution does not fragment. But the perception that the city centre is crime-ridden together with increased competition from attorneys - who are now allowed to appear in the High Court - have fuelled calls for a relaxation of the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Sandton chambers are at Arbitration House, also the headquarters for the Arbitration Foundation. The Bar has had a few teething problems with the building, losing a few hundred thousand rand from unoccupied space - said to be due in part to the late completion of rooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bar Council chairman, Johann Gautschi, expects the 90% occupancy rate to increase now that the restriction on advocates has been lifted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Inkatha Freedom Party is planning to strip all political powers from its secretary general's post in an effort to prevent future holders commanding the influence over the party enjoyed by past incumbents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Ngubane, the KwaZulu-Natal premier and IFP acting national chairman, told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that party officials had agreed that the post should be retained, but largely as an administrative position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next secretary general - the current incumbent, Ziba Jiyane, steps down later this year - would not be involved in day-to-day political issues as this &quot;detracts from the goal of creating a vibrant, cohesive and effective party,&quot; Ngubane said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new secretary general would instead &quot;service the party structures, ensure training goes on in the branches and that the programmes we have in terms of community involvement are implemented&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngubane added that no clear contender had yet emerged as Jiyane's successor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiyane is expected to step down at the IFP's national conference in July after an apparent fall-out with the IFP's leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi.  Previous holders included high-profile players such as Oscar Dhlomo, who has quit politics for business, and Sibusiso Bengu, the current education minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngubane said he has worked &quot;very well&quot; with Buthelezi since taking over from Frank Mdlalose: &quot;I've made all sorts of suggestions to him. He has shown me where there are difficulties, given me alternative perspectives, but we work well,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngubane also defended his recent provincial Cabinet appointments. He handed the safety and security portfolio to Traditional Affairs MEC Chief Nyanga Ngubane, despite a recent South African National Defence Force intelligence report alleging he was involved in paramilitary training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngubane said he had &quot;nothing tangible&quot; to suggest that Nyanga Ngubane was unsuitable for the post, arguing that his dual portfolios would improve prospects for rural stability. &quot;There's a sense of neglect as far as safety and security is concerned with the rural areas compared to the cities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngubane said that if he fired MECs such as Prince Gideon Zulu, who faced similar allegations as Chief Ngubane, IFP supporters would be &quot;baffled as to what possessed me. A person like Prince Gideon is absolutely revered in terms of him being a repository of Zulu culture, Zulu history. He leads the cultural events in song, in relating oral tradition and so forth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That man is not a lightweight among the Zulu people. So you don't go on a flimsy thing which really has no substance and say I'm going to deal with this person by removing him from the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The probe which prompted Van Zyl's suspension is far from complete, raising suspicions of a witch-hunt, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICA'S top state oil official, suspended last week, is taking the blame for a sanctions-busting deal cut for the former government. No evidence has yet been found that he personally benefited from the deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also emerged this week that Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Penuell Maduna selected the auditors - whose preliminary report triggered the suspension of Kobus van Zyl, general manager of the Strategic Fuel Fund (SFF) - because they were formerly &quot;deprived&quot;. Maduna's office said:&quot;We don't want to bring in establishment people&quot; and criticised the existing auditors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduna's new auditing firm, Ntsaluba Nkonki Sizwe, have refused to comment on whether it has experience investigating international oil deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auditors only started investigating in February and have not questioned the official who was Van Zyl's superior at the time the deals were signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduna's office said this week that Van Zyl had been suspended on &quot;probable cause&quot;, but it did not know when the investigation would be completed.  Maduna's adviser, Walter Gcabashe, said the investigators had found no &quot; direct evidence&quot; of personal enrichment and had yet to quantify the losses for which Van Zyl is being blamed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl's suspension follows a series of departures by senior white officials from government agencies working under Maduna. The board of the Central Energy Fund (CEF), which oversees the SFF, has recently been revamped with the appointment of black directors. Their oil industry background is limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood that publication of the CEF's latest annual results, believed to be exceptionally good, has been postponed. Maduna's reasons for this are not known. The SFF, the oil trading business which Van Zyl runs, is thought to have made a profit of more than R200-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Maduna's office, Ntsaluba Nkonki Sizwe's report, which examines two contracts which SFF signed in 1992 and subsequently renewed to buy oil from Egypt, found South Africa was paying an extra seven US cents a barrel. Gcabashe says the minister called in the auditing team after reviewing the contracts, which are renewed annually, last November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl was suspended 10 days ago at a board meeting in Mossel Bay attended by Maduna. Van Zyl's wife said this week that Maduna had ordered them not to talk to the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Danie Vorster, CEF chairman and Van Zyl's superior until 1994, was not contacted during the probe. Vorster, currently managing director of the state- owned phosphate operation Foskor, confirmed this but declined further comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CEF, whose other businesses include the synthetic fuel producer Mossgas and oil exploration company Soekor, only completed its transformation into a normal commercial company in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until then, its main business was to navigate the maze of fuel sanctions which were in place until the end of 1993. It was empowered to pay anything necessary to bring oil into the country. CEF has frequently been accused of acting in an unaccountable manner - partly because of the need for secrecy and partly because of the laissez faire attitude of previous energy ministers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One official, who has seen the report, told the Mail &amp; Guardian that he believed that thus far there was insufficient &quot;substance&quot; to warrant Van Zyl's suspension. He said that if Van Zyl had continued paying a commission on the post-sanctions contract renewals, he may have been guilty merely of bad judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One African National Congress oil industry expert said Maduna wanted to flush out the old guard. Only two members of the old white board have survived Maduna's revamp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who have left Maduna's domain are department director general Gert Venter, who retired earlier this year, and diamond board head Gerhard Bindeman, who was dismissed at the end of last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gcabashe dismissed suggestions of a witch-hunt. &quot;There is always talk when there are changes ... there is lots wrong with the present establishment.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also criticised the CEF's current auditors - the auditor general and international accounting firm Price Waterhouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they didn't detect anything, it would be unwise to keep them on,&quot; he added. &quot;We don't need them if they can't pick up things like that. They have tried to conceal several things regarding the Egyptian deal and possibly other deals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were several &quot;curious and questionable&quot; aspects, in particular payments on the deals to a middleman in Switzerland named in the report as &quot; Sakri&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Zyl has been criticised in the past as a creature of the old order, but has won respect in ANC oil industry circles. A senior ANC official said that when he first met Van Zyl he thought he was &quot;the old regime incarnate. But I soon he realised he knew his stuff and that if he could do it (oil trading) for the volk, he could do it for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IT took several high-profile rapes such as that of Nomboniso Gasa on Robben Island and two sisters in Observatory, Johannesburg, to force radical changes in the way police investigate sex crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the Independent Complaints Directorate issued far-reaching recommendations to improve the training of police officers and the facilities for victims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This followed an investigation by the directorate into the way police handled the Gasa rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the proposals are that the victim should have the choice of speaking to a male or female officer; that each police station provide a list of support organisations; that crimes against women and children be treated as a priority; and that a new code of conduct be established for the investigating officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, rape attacks continue to plague women across the country. Over the Easter weekend at least 116 cases were reported; a high proportion involved children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the highest number were raped in the Western Cape with 81 reported cases; 33 of the victims were under the age of 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one incident, three girls between four and nine years of age were raped in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha after being lured into nearby shacks by three men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the many tales of horror, in Sibasa, in the Northern Province, a 25- year-old mother and her 12-year-old daughter were assaulted by two drunken men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were held hostage for nearly three hours and repeatedly raped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the men finally became tired they stole R200 and a portable radio before running away,&quot; said a police spokesman.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Robben Island rape victim Nomboniso Gasa speaks out on police foul-ups and a carefully orchestrated campaign to smear her through the Afrikaans-owned media, reports Gustav Thiel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LEADING feminist Nomboniso Gasa believes she has been raped twice: first by the man who attacked her on Robben Island, and then by police who botched the investigation, and instead leaked allegations that she was lying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks following the rape, which made front-page headlines around the world in January, the wife of African National Congress MP Raymond Suttner was smeared by press reports suggesting her story was fabricated. The failure of the police to arrest suspects appeared to add weight to the rumours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police failed to make any breakthroughs after nine men - who had been on the island on the night of the rape and did not have alibis - refused to undergo lie detector and forensic tests.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a report by the Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi's Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) released this week says the initial investigation &quot;lacked competence and professionalism&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICD traced the rumours against Gasa to &quot;unofficial police sources&quot; and insisted on a public apology from the police - in particular the police commissioner of the Western Cape, Leon Wessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report - which has Mufamadi's full backing - also recommended sweeping changes in the way police handle rape cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive interview with the Mail &amp; Guardian, Gasa says she feels vindicated by the report, despite suffering weeks of gossip. She was hospitalised for a week for stress after the rumours began.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gasa, a member of the gender commission, also says she made the right decision to go public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I took the right decision politically,&quot; she says. &quot;I feel that I made the right decision, but at a huge personal cost and I don't know how it will affect me in future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She went public &quot;to make sure that a better system is devised to improve the plight of women who have similar experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since I went public, the reactions from women who went through similar experiences have been overwhelming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My only hope is that through this the way all rape cases are handled will be dramatically improved. In this regard, the implementation of the ICD's recommendations will play a pivotal role.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suttner, who has been at her side throughout the ordeal, says: &quot;There's been a sustained and concerted effort by certain segments of the media to discredit Nomboniso through vicious reporting based on unnamed police sources.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple is unhappy, in particular, about reports in the Nasionale Pers publications, Die Burger, Rapport and City Press, that were based on unnamed sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nasionale Pers CEO Ton Vosloo declined to comment, saying his company's editors have complete editorial freedom. Die Burger acting editor Chris Moolman said his newspaper was willing to talk to Gasa and Suttner about their complaints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the support from Mufamadi's office, Gasa and Suttner still have misgivings. They are wary of the disgraced policemen's response to the report which could conceivably provoke yet another smear campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICD report states: &quot;There is prima facie evidence of improper conduct and/or insensitivity displayed towards the complainant by at least one or more of the members comprising the initial investigating team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also states that &quot;there is prima facie evidence of negligence and/or dereliction of duty on the part of the members of the initial investigating team in the manner in which the investigation was handled&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team neglected, for example, to thoroughly search the boat that brought Gasa to the mainland after the rape and no comprehensive list was compiled of the people on the boat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It recommends that &quot;in the light of the finding that certain members, viz.  Constable M McLean and Captain Kevin Jones, were dishonest in their evidence before us and did not take us into their confidence ... such members be strongly reprimanded&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa and Suttner feel the strongest vindication in the report is lodged in the recommendation that Wessels publicly acknowledge the findings of the report and apologise unreservedly to her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wessels on Wednesday did extend an &quot;unreserved apology&quot; to Gasa. &quot;The South African Police Services acknowledges that the treatment of women in the criminal justice system particularly, and society in general, is inadequate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa declined to comment on Wessels's statement, saying she needed to follow the reaction of the police and the media to it. &quot;I would be particularly interested in observing the police's commitment to implementing the recommendations made in the report by the ICD.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - On 31 March, Monday after Easter, at 12.00 noon, the police with a bulldozer, demolished the Catholic Centre at El-Tei destroying the church, the school and all the furniture in them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A courageous woman defied the police, entered the Church and removed from the Tabernacle the Consecrated Hosts. The Christian community taken by surprise, protested against the unexpected action of the police.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No previous information of the impending action had been given by government authorities; no document or permit for destruction were presented by the police at the request of the Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tereia is a shanty town at the southern outskirts of Khartoum, and part of the St. Joseph's Parish, entrusted to the Salesian Fathers. The Centre (a compound of 40 x 15 metres), built in bricks and cement, consisted of a large hall (used also on Sunday for Holy Mass),a school for 350 students, and the office of the headmaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the afternoon of 1st April, the Christians of the area assembled for prayer at the spot of the destroyed church. The Archbishop of Khartoum, H G Gabriel Zubeir Wako, was unable to attend since he was in the hospital) recovering, from an operation. But the Apostolic Nuncio of Khartoum, H.G.  Joseph E Ender, was there and described what had happened &quot;an act of vandalism&quot;. The celebration was very long and quite emotional. The words most used in prayer were &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;no more sufferings&quot; &quot;no more discrimination&quot;.  &quot;freedom&quot;. The following day, 2nd April, the police and a demolition team with a bulldozer under the orders of a captain and a security officer moved to destroy the church at Kalakla Gubba, not far from El Tereis Centre. They wrote on the wall of the church &quot;La Illah illa Allah - Allah Akbar&quot;, and the word &quot;'total Destruction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they had no chance of proceeding with the work. The Christians were not taken by surprise. They came in big numbers, climbed on walls and roof. One placed himself on the big, plate of the bulldozer. The lawyer of the Catholic Church too was there. The situation became quite tense. After much discussion, threats, punches and couple of bricks thrown at the Police, the demolition team left the place. The team moved to the Centre of Wad Amara for the same purpose. They found there too a lot of Christians ready to defend their church and school . Mr Abbas, the leader of the Town Planning Organization had to escape because someone stripped him off of his jallabya and left him in his undergarment only. The Christians stayed all day and night to keep vigil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacts were made with the government authorities but none was ready to take the responsibility of having given the order. The Nuncio and the French Ambassador went to visit the broken church and the Christians in Tereia. The Sudan Council of Churches was informed, and news of the facts was sent to the representatives of the UNO in Khartoum. Church Leaders went twice to see the second vice-president Mr. George Congor, who by name is a Christian. but he refused to receive them. Meanwhile young people of the parish are keeping watch at the centres.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - The following background analysis comes from Bread for the World, 1100 Wayne Avenue, Suite 1000, Silver Spring, MD 20910, Phone: 301-608- 2400, Fax:301-608-2401, E-mail: bread@igc.org.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WORLD BANK'S INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (IDA)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is IDA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IDA is a World Bank program which lends funds at very low interest rates (.  5% over 35-40 years) to the world's poorest countries. IDA disbursed $5 billion in such &quot;soft&quot; loans to poor countries in FY 1996. IDA's largest borrowers are India, China, and Vietnam. IDA programs are funded for three- year periods by 33 donor countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From 1994 to 1996, 75 percent of all IDA loans supported investments in infrastructure, agriculture, and basic social services (education, population, health and nutrition). The remaining 25 percent supported economic reform, or &quot;structural adjustment&quot; operations. However, most adjustment lending was concentrated in Africa, where adjustment represented almost half all IDA loans, although the share is now falling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why does IDA matter?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seventy-nine countries, home to 80 percent of the world's people living in absolute poverty, are eligible for IDA loans. The countries that receive IDA loans have an average income of $400, compared with $4,000 for countries that receive grants from the U.S. bilateral aid agency (AID). The World Bank's member governments have targeted approximately 45-50 percent of IDA's resources for Africa and IDA is the largest source of development finance for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the World Bank provides economic policy advice to borrowing country governments, and its &quot;stamp of approval&quot; is critical to the lending and investment decisions of other donors and the private sector. In fact, other regional development banks and some industrial country donors model their policies and aid programs on that of the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What are the criticisms of IDA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IDA's performance and that of the World Bank generally has been extensively critiqued by non-governmental organizations, academics, and even by the Bank itself.  Following are some of the major concerns:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Structural adjustment. Since the 1980s, the Bank has shifted from lending exclusively for development projects, to lending tied to &quot;structural adjustment&quot; reforms that are intended to restore financial stability and promote economic growth. Typical reforms are privatizing state-owned organizations, increasing exports, removing subsidies and price controls for farmers, reducing government spending on education and health, and devaluing currencies. Structural adjustment reforms have been planned with too little regard for the impact on poor people and many have entailed social hardships.  In response, the Bank has supported &quot;social safety nets&quot; to mitigate the negative impact, rather than designing and implementing policies that benefit poor people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Lack of participation. Structural adjustment programs as well as projects are often designed in Washington or with a borrowing government's finance ministry with little prior consultation of affected populations. Non- governmental organizations sometimes have difficulty getting access to information about key World Bank policies, such as its three- year assistance strategies for each borrowing country. Some Bank programs and projects have been widely criticized for waste, environmental destruction, social dislocation, and even corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Undemocratic governance. Voting power on the World Bank board is based on financial contributions, rather than on the principle of &quot;one country, one vote&quot;. The world's five richest countries hold almost 40 percent of votes, of which the US share is 17 percent. This imbalance of voting power steers the Bank toward the interests of the industrial countries. Yet the Bank has little leverage over the policies of industrial countries, which often don't practice what they preach through the Bank about fiscal, monetary, trade, or adjustment policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Debt. Some countries have used IDA funds to help pay back the debt they owe to the World Bank for past loans. Such debt repayments are sapping scarce financial resources away from investments in health care, education, and other human development. Although the Bank has recently agreed to a modest debt reduction plan for a limited number of countries, the Bank has failed to adequately address the root causes of indebtedness in poor countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil society organizations in both industrial and developing countries have exerted considerable pressure on the World Bank, directly and through their own governments, to address these criticisms. In response, the Bank has initiated some reforms, especially under the current president, James Wolfensohn. For example, the Bank has adopted a plan to increase popular participation in projects and policies; increased lending for health, education, and population; canceled several dam and large infrastructure projects which might have damaged the environment and displaced people; and initiated a joint Bank-NGO review of the social and economic impact of structural adjustment. However, changes in practice has lagged behind changes in rhetoric and in policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do southern partners say about IDA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most overseas non-governmental organizations with whom we collaborate give qualified support for IDA. In 1995, a group of African development NGOs issued a statement urging support for full funding for IDA. However, the statement raises criticisms and calls for a series of qualitative improvements, including a more central focus on poverty reduction and equity in the Bank's economic policy prescriptions and lending practices, greater participation by local organizations of civil society in the Bank's process, and a reduction in the share of loans for structural adjustment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same year, 11 Asian NGOs issued a similar statement, urging support for IDA funding conditioned upon the Bank's progress toward reform. These include more direct targeting of poverty reduction, a rejection of current structural adjustment approaches, full participation by affected communities throughout all projects, and changes to Bank staffing and operational practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some southern NGOs partly blame U.S. critics of the Bank, especially environmentalists, for the recent deep cuts in U.S. funding for IDA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is Bread for the World's position?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bread for the World takes a position similar to that of our southern partners -- namely, support for full funding while conditioning future support on IDA progress toward better development results. The statements of colleagues in Africa and other developing regions have been important in our decision to support IDA. In 1994, Bread for the World adopted a policy which conditions future support for IDA on specific reforms, including:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* greater openness and participation at all levels of its policy and lending operations;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* reducing the share of lending for structural adjustment and focusing adjustment on policies which benefit poor people and preserve the environment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* greater focus on poverty reduction in projects;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* reevaluating economic growth strategies to fully account for social and environmental impacts;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* action to reduce debts owed by poor countries to the Bank itself and other multilateral institutions, governments, and commercial banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1996, Bread for the World graded the Bank's progress on these reforms and, overall, gave the Bank a &quot;C&quot; average. Bread for the World concluded that while the Bank's rhetoric had shifted and some policies had been changed, the Bank has a &quot;poor record of putting its policies into practice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the US stance toward IDA?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government has helped secure important reforms in the World Bank.  For example, Congressional pressure helped make the World Bank more concerned about environmental problems, and promoted policies for improved access to Bank information. The U.S. Congress also helped persuade the Bank to establish an independent appeals mechanism for citizens who have been adversely affected by a Bank project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More problematic is the failure of the United States to fulfill U.S.  financial commitments to IDA. The United States used to be the largest donor to IDA, but by now the U.S. contribution has fallen to less than 15 percent, second to Japan. Between FY 1995 and FY 1997, Congress slashed US funding for IDA from $1.175 billion to $700 million. The steep cuts caused the US government to fall into arrears and sharply reduced its financial commitment to IDA's current three-year funding cycle. Because other donor governments peg their contributions to that of the United States, IDA's funding could collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the U.S. failure to fulfill past financial commitments, U.S.  negotiators agreed with European partners in early 1996 that the United States would not contribute for a full year while it tried to make up arrears.  During that year, U.S. companies and U.S. private voluntary organizations would be ineligible for IDA-funded contracts.  There have been no complaints from U.S. businesses or U.S. PVOs about this. However, some members of Congress were upset by the arrangement, and used it as reason for further curtailing FY 1997 funding for IDA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Clinton Administration has submitted a FY 1998 budget request to Congress that seeks $800 million for FY 1998 and an additional $234 million to pay off arrears, for a total of $1.034 billion. The administration has made IDA funding a top priority, and will likely press the Congress to appropriate the full amount.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE AND TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Eastern Zaire - most information as of 3 April a) Large numbers of exhausted refugees are dying on the road south of Kisangani, having been refused permission to stay in Lula, and forced to move back towards Ubundu. b) Train which left Kisangani on 27 March drops food along the railway line; two WFP truck convoys also deliver food. Local Red Cross counts 95,502 refugees at five sites along railway line during first distribution. c) WFP to cover logistical side under planned UNHCR repatriation operation; 20 UNHCR trucks are being flown from Mwanza to Kisangani on WFP plane. Some refugees to be flown to Rwanda while majority to go by truck to Bukavu, walking for some stretches of the road. d) Group of 15,000-20,000 refugees emerges from the forests west of Goma, and repatriation to Rwanda picks up momentum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Rwanda a) Refugees returning to Rwanda via Gisenyi and Cyangugu are in poor shape; wet feeding programme for all returnees passing through Cyangugu is being considered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Burundi a) Rapid Evaluation teams from WFP, FAO, UNICEF and DHA completes series of visits to 70 displaced person sites in nine provinces and give findings. b) Increasing number of beneficiaries in northern parts of country; deliveries face serious difficulties due to poor access, aggravated by the rainy season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Tanzania a) Additional trucks obtained in continuing efforts to stockpile a sixty-day ration stock in camps in the Kigoma region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) Sudanese refugees continue returning to Sudan; movement back and forth between SPLA held areas in Sudan and settlements in Uganda make assessment of numbers of returnees difficult. b) Assistance to Sudanese refugees compounded by a break in the food pipeline. c) Sudanese Government warns relief agencies operating in rebel-held areas in southern Sudan that they may become the target of Government forces, accusing agencies entering the country from Uganda of having violated prior agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. ETHIOPIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) Inter-agency assessment teams have reported on needs in drought-affected areas in Somali, Borena, and Bale zones of Oromiya and South Omo zone of the Southern Region (SNNP). Pasturalists face difficulties in securing adequate water and pasture resources due to the partial failure of the short rains in October/November 1996 and currently high stocking rates of cattle on limited range lands. Three-month relief food intervention recommended for a targeted population of some 800,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. SOMALIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Update a) Rains reported in many areas of the country. Humanitarian response to targeted areas affected by drought in the south, north-west north- east and central regions continues. Activities in the north-west continue through UN/NGO and the Egal administration group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A. EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. EASTERN ZAIRE - information as of 3 April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Lula, the site 7 km south of Kisangani where thousands of refugees had concentrated until 31 March, is empty. The refugees, driven by rebels authorities further south, back towards Ubundu, have reached the limit of their strength and, exhausted, malnourished and sick, are dying by the hundreds. A train loaded with WFP food left Kisangani on 27 March, dropping food at five different points along the line. Six metric tons of high-protein foods were delivered by truck. At the first distribution carried out on March 28, the local Red Cross counted 95,502 refugees at these points. Most of the refugees are at km 25 and km 40 but others, the weaker and the sicker ones, are further south, at km 52 and km 82, too weak to even react to the arrival of the food. Two other convoys were sent by WFP: one on 31 March with 110 metric tons of food and the other on 3 April with 120 metric tons of food.  The latter will deliver food at km 25, km 40 and km 82.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Rebels authorities have not yet agreed to the use of Kisangani as a hub for the repatriation of the refugees. Under a repatriation plan prepared by UNHCR, WFP will be responsible for all logistics issues, and 20 UNHCR trucks are being flown from Mwanza to Kisangani with the WFP aircraft. Under the plan prepared, the most vulnerable refugees will be flown back to Rwanda but the majority will be transported by truck to Bukavu. Along some road stretches, the trucks will not be able to pass and the refugees will have to walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 WFP continues airlifting food commodities to Kisangani, for distribution to the refugees scattered in Eastern Zaire. Since mid-February, when this air operation initiated, until the end of March, WFP has delivered 1,260 metric tons of food commodities. On 4 April, another air operation is due to start from Entebbe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 Amisi and Tingi Tingi camps are now empty and all surviving refugees were evacuated by air to Goma using WFP aircraft, and from there moved to Rwanda. Many of the refugees who were still in Tingi Tingi and Amisi died, and some others were so weak and sick that on arrival in Goma they had to be transported by ambulance from the airport to the local hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 A group of 15,000-20,000 refugees has emerged from the forests and is concentrating in Karuba, west of Goma. These refugees seem to be part of a larger group who left their camps in Goma in October and had been missing since then, hidden in the Masisi area. They are not in as appalling condition as those further west, although some require medical assistance. Repatriation to Rwanda has, once again, picked up momentum. In addition to the refugees repatriating from the Tingi Tingi and Amisi camps, others are returning through the northern axis: 1,877 repatriated on 1 April through Karuba and Tongo way stations. By 3 April, the total number repatriated during the previous two days was around 4,800, according to UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 WFP has re-opened its office in Uvira. This will facilitate the repatriation of Rwandan and Burundian refugees who fled to Kalemie, and the return of Zairean refugees who sought asylum in Kigoma in Tanzania. It is planned that the refugees will receive assistance in Uvira on their way back home. From 25 to 31 March, WFP distributed high-protein biscuits to returning refugees and released 37 metric tons of food commodities for sites hosting street children, handicapped, unaccompanied children and hospital patients in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Food requirements for the month of April to cover the needs of returnees and refugees total 12,629 metric tons of food, including 4,754 metric tons for food-for-work schemes involving 336,467 beneficiaries.  Discussions are on-going in all sub-offices, related to the shift from large scale free food distribution, towards food-for-work activities. Food commodities, including high-protein biscuits have been pre-positioned at transit centres and entry points, in readiness for an influx of returnees.  During March, WFP distributed 14,350 metric tons of food in Rwanda, just over 70% of the monthly requirements initially estimated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 From 24 to 30 March 4,099 refugees returned to Rwanda, mostly through Gisenyi and Cyangugu. The refugees arriving are in a very poor state and UNHCR is considering a wet feeding programme for all returnees passing through the transit centre in Cyangugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 Four Rapid Evaluation teams from WFP, FAO, UNICEF and DHA visited 70 sites housing over 300,000 displaced persons in nine provinces. Findings on food resources and agricultural production are as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) 45% of the sites have a high relative vulnerability level (RVL), with populations having one meal a day, living mostly on roots, with poor access to land, seeds and tools, with insecurity and distance from their plots reducing the time spend working the land, and the next harvest expected to be much smaller than normal b) 37% of the evaluated population have a medium RVL, living on the food left from last year's poor harvest, with access to land and possessing some seeds, but affected by insecurity and distance from their land c) 18% of the population evaluated have a low RVL, possessing a higher than average level of food and food resources, with a good capacity for revenue generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.2 The recommendations from the Rapid Evaluation exercise include regular monitoring, relief food distribution for some high RVL areas, punctual emergency food distribution for medium RVL groups, distribution of seeds and tools to high and medium RVL groups, reduction in camp sizes and establishment of sites near residents land, assistance to resettlement in home areas and food-for-work projects for displaced groups dependent on non- agricultural activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.3 WFP has been designated as the lead agency, in coordination with DHA, to respond to the grave situation in camps for displaced and re-grouped persons in Karuzi province. Other agencies have been urged to provide urgent assistance for these camps, to prevent the situation from deteriorating even further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.4 A joint WFP, FAO, DHA team visited the Ruhinga regroupement camp in Kayanza province, where a WFP team was distributing a combined food and seeds package. This camp, established during January 1997 is the largest regroupement site in the province, hosting some 20,000 people. Although the situation in the camp appears better than in Karuzi, there are concerns related to the size of the camp and to how conditions will develop if the camps remain as such for long periods of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.5 The beneficiary caseload in Burundi for the period 24 to 29 March totalled 196,329 persons. Deliveries to the increasing number of beneficiaries in northern parts of country face serious difficulties due to poor access to the sites, which is aggravated during the rainy season. Large capacity trucks are not practical for such poor roads and private truckers do not find it cost effective to use small tonnage vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Small numbers of Burundian refugees continue to leave their camps in Ngara. This unassisted repatriation is attributed to the security situation in the camps, due to conflicts between different factions. From 24 to 30 March a total 538 Burundians crossed the Kabanga border back to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 While some refugees are voluntarily repatriating, others continue to arrive. During the last week of March, 372 refugees entered Kibondo district, 1,552 arrived in Kigoma town and another 24 refugees arrived directly at camps in Kasulu. As of mid-March, Tanzania hosted 372,289 refugees in the Kagera and Kigoma regions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 Efforts to stockpile a sixty-day ration stock in camps in the Kigoma region continue. WFP has mobilised additional leased trucks and has pooled trucking resources with UNHCR, having already succeeded in pre-positioning a two-week stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Sudanese refugees continue returning to Sudan but some seem to be shuttling between SPLA-held areas in Sudan and settlements in Uganda. This makes it difficult to assess how many refugees have returned and to plan an adequate response. Assistance to Sudanese refugees is also compounded by a break in the food pipeline due to resourcing shortfalls. Additional donor pledges are urgently required for WFP's emergency operation in Uganda. The Sudanese Government has warned relief agencies operating in rebel-held areas in southern Sudan that they may become the target of Government forces, and accused agencies entering the country from Uganda of having violated prior agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 The refugee caseload in camps in south-western Uganda totals 37,912 persons: 17,178 Rwandans and 20,734 Zaireans. The Government of Uganda maintains that the Rwandan refugees who came from camps in Tanzania must either go home or return to Tanzania. In Uganda, there are now 7,500 Rwandan refugees who were previously in Tanzania, with arrivals during March totalling 995 persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. ETHIOPIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Inter-agency assessment teams were dispatched to reported drought- affected areas in Somali, Borena, and Bale zones of Oromiya and South Omo zone of the Southern Region (SNNP) over the period 10-17 March 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Populations in the areas visited generally appear to be facing particular difficulties in securing adequate water and pasture resources due to the partial failure of the short rains in October/November 1996 and currently high stocking rates of cattle on limited range lands. Implications for food security are negative since milk cows in these areas generally stopped producing milk 3-4 months ago (milk being the staple of pastoralists' diet). Lactating mothers and young children are most vulnerable to the general lack of protein in the diet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 A vulnerable population of some 800,000 people has been identified and short-term targeted food assistance recommended for a three-month period. It is anticipated that assistance in the water, livestock, food and health sectors will be provided through a cross-mandate approach by the various UN agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. SOMALIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Rains have been reported in many areas of the country. Humanitarian response to targeted areas affected by drought in the south, north-west north- east and central regions continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP Rehabilitation and Reconstruction operation (EMOP 5036.04), providing emergency assistance to 150,000 people, is almost fully resourced for 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The Drought Inter-Agency Assessment Mission for the north-east has finalised its assessment and identified 40-60 villages covering 4,000 households in drought-affected areas. WFP will distribute 212 metric tons of food commodities in these areas immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.4 WFP is also providing assistance to internally displaced persons in Buale, who have recently left drought-affected villages in Bay and Gedo. Some 1,500 metric tons of food commodities are expected to be distributed through food-for-work/emergency recovery schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.5 In southern and central Somalia, action is under way to pre-position 4, 790 metric tons of food commodities, which will be distributed through local NGOs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.6 WFP and the Food Security Assessment Unit (FSAU) will establish an Alert Site Nutrition Surveillance System (ASNSS), which will work with NGOs to provide an early warning system in vulnerable areas for any significant deterioration in the nutritional status among vulnerable groups, and to obtain information on the reasons for change in nutritional status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.7 Humanitarian activities in the north-west continue through UN/NGO and the Egal administration group, to assist drought-affected areas in Sool, Sannag, Togdher, Woqooyi Galbed and Awdal regions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Patriot Resistance, 1939-1941 We saw last week how Mussolini's Italy established its occupation in 1936.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now read on: Lej Hayla Maryam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Ethiopia's military collapse in 1935-6, patriotic resistance continued throughout the occupation. Many patriotic Ethiopians were from the outset determined to continue the struggle. The first to do so was Lej Hayla Maryam Mammo, of Dabra Berhan, 130 kilometres north of Addis Ababa, who on 4 May 1936 attacked a group of invading forces on the way to capital. This action earned him the title the &quot;first arbagna&quot;, or, patriot, of Shawa. Other, more or less un-co-ordinated, attacks on the invaders followed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All Rebel Prisoners Must B e Shot&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to crush such opposition Graziani, who had by then become the Italian viceroy, issued an edict in the middle of May, proclaiming that Italy was the &quot;absolute master of Ethiopia&quot;, and would &quot;remain so at whatever cost&quot;.  He threatened that he would use &quot;extreme severity&quot; to rebels, but the &quot; greatest generosity&quot; to Ethiopians who submitted. Mussolini, agreed with this policy, and telegraphed , on 5 June, that &quot;all rebel prisoners must be shot&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Patriot Attempt to Recapture Addis Ababa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undeterred by threats of vengeance numerous Ethiopian patriots determined to fight on. During the rains of 1936 several conceived the ambitious plan of re-capturing Addis Ababa. On 28 July one of the principal young Shawan chiefs, Dajazmach Abarra Kasa, son of Ras Kasa Haylu, attacked from the northwest, but was repulsed by Italian machine-gunning from the air. Almost a month later, on 26 August, one of Emperor Menilek's former commanders, Dajazmach Balcha, launched a further unsuccessful assault from the south-west, which was likewise defeated on account of Italian control of the air. After the rains the invaders resumed the offensive, carrying out extensive bombing, and poison gassing, in Shawa, Lasta, Charchar, Yergalam, and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abraha Deboch and Moges Asgadom</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An attempt on Graziani's life by two Eritreans, Abraha Daboch and Moges Asgadom, on 19 February 1937, opened a new phase of the struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Graziani Massacre</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fascists, reacting violently to the attempted assassination of their leader, carried out a three-day massacre in Addis Ababa, in the course of which, between 19 and 21 February, thousands of innocent Ethiopians were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dabra Damo Monastery: &quot;No More Trace Remains&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three months later, on 20 May, Graziani ordered the execution of the monks at the historic Shawan monastery of Dabra Libanos. Two hundred and ninety- seven monks were accordingly shot, and 129 deacons were killed a few days later, after which Graziani proudly telegaphed to Mussolini, &quot;of the monastery, there remains no more trace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dajazmach Haylu Kabada, Dajazmach Mangasha, Balay Zalaka, and Ras Ababa Aragay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many survivors fled the capital, and joined the patriots. Strengthened by this increase in their numbers patriot forces again took the offensive during the 1937 rains, in Lasta under Dajazmach Haylu Kabada, and in Gojjam under Dajazmach Mangasha and Belay Zalaka. Mussolini responded by ordering Graziani to &quot;use all measures, including gas&quot;. The Viceroy intensified his reign of terror, but, unable to crush the rebellion in Shawa, opened abortive peace negotiations with the area's principal patriot leader, Ras Ababa Aragay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lej Zawd Asfaw, Blatta Takala Walda Hawaryat, and Shalaqa Masfen Seleshi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occupying forces took the offensive again after the rains, but the patriots did not lose hope. Well aware of the increasing political divergence between the &quot;totalitarian&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; powers in Europe, they were confident that the latter would ultimately be embroiled in a European war and as a result be obliged to come to their assistance. Graziani frankly admitted as much when he observed, on 9 November 1937, that the &quot;rebels&quot; were awaiting a European war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lej Zawde Asfaw, Blatta Takala Walda Hawaryat, and Shalaqa Masfen Seleshi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the patriots at about this time also attempted to forge more integrated resistance, as indicated by the fact that three of the principal Shawan patriot leaders, Lej Zawde Asfaw, Blatta Takala Walda Hawaryat, and Shalaqa Masfen Seleshi at about this time drew up a manifesto urging the Gojjam people to rally behind them. Graziani, however, continued to insist on repression. Referring to the Shawan Patriots, he declared it necessary to &quot; eliminate them, eliminate them, eliminate them&quot;, as he had preached since assuming office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Inside&quot; Patriots; Shawaragga Gadle</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patriot movement was centred mainly in Shawa, Bagemder and Gojjam, but drew support from almost all parts of the country. Some of the most resolute fighters included Eritrean desereters from the Italian colonial army. There was also an active underground movement, in Addis Ababa and a few other towns, composed of wust arbagna, or &quot;inside&quot; patriots. They helped to provide military, medical and other supplies to the patriots in the field, and to inform them of enemy movements. Many Ethiopian women, including one of the daughters of Ras Kasa and the renowned Shawaragga Gadle, were also prominent, either in the field or as wust patriots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lej Yohannes Iyasu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Continued patriot resistance was one of the causes of the Viceroy's dismissal, and replacement, on 26 December 1937, by the Duke of Aosta, a member of the Italian royal family. Soon after his appointment the Duke's chief-of-staff, Ugo Cavellero, admitted that &quot;large parts&quot; of Shawa and Amhara were then in rebellion, and that 'pockets of resistance' also persisted in the south-west. He added that the &quot;rebels&quot; enjoyed the &quot;full support&quot; of the people, who were ready to join them. The extent of opposition to the invaders was confirmed by the exiled Emperor Haile Sellassie, who claimed that patriot resistance was then &quot;more extensive&quot; than ever before.  Menilek's great-grandson, Lej Yohannes Iyasu, himself a patriot, observed that the invader, though in control of the major towns, had been unable to conquer the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mussolini &quot;Very Dissatisfied&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 1939, the year of the outbreak of the European war, a stalemate had developed. The Italians had failed to crush the patriots, but the latter were unable to break into the wellguarded Italian forts. Mussolini's son-in-law, Count Ciano, nevertheless noted, on 1 January, 1940 that the Duce was &quot;very much dissatisfied&quot;, for Amhara was in &quot;complete revolt&quot;, and sixty-five Italian battalions were &quot;compelled&quot; to live in forts. The situation was so serious that the Duke of Aosta advised Mussolini to avoid a European war &quot; which would bring on the high seas the task of pacifying the country and jeopardise the conquest itself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A State of Latent Rebellion&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A leading fascist, Arcanovaldo Bonacorsi, reported, in May, that throughout the empire there was &quot;a state of latent rebellion&quot;, which:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;would have its final and tragic denouncement when war breaks out with our enemies. If at any point whatever, a detachment of English or French were to enter with banner unfurled they would need little or no troops for they would find the vast mass of the Abyssinian population would unite themselves to that flag to combat and eject our forces. In the case of such an emergency we should find ourselves unable to withstand our enemy given the state of unpreparedness and lack of equipment of our forces&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia (CAFPDE) called a mass rally at the Meskel Square Sunday 30 March calling for unity against treatment of three major sectors of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attendance was not high -- with an estimated 500 people turning up --but CAFPDE nonetheless voiced its anger clearly against unfair acts committed against farmers, the business community and the Addis Ababa University students recently. Head of CAFPDE, Dr. Beyene Petros said in his speech that the present government had let its true 'communist' outlook show when it divided the farmers in the Amhara region into three categories; the remnant feudal, bureaucrat and poor farmer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Beyene Petros added that many farmers had been flogged in public and arrested while some committed suicide protesting against the system of land redistribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Beyene Petros also spoke against the arrest of the university students who had participated in a demonstration calling for a 'fair distribution of land'--adding that this latest protest was reminiscent of the 'land to the tiller' movement of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers from the Amhara region made their way to the capital, Addis Ababa, in their hundreds around a month ago to appeal to the federal government against what they saw as the unfair treatment that has apparently left them with less than 1 hectare of land according to the Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO). Since early last week though, the whereabouts of the farmers has become a mystery with their disappearance in the night from the area near the Giorghis Church where they had been camping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council of Alternative Forces for Peace and Democracy in Ethiopia also spoke out against the new rent regulation imposed by the Addis Ababa Administration on around 27,100 kebele owned business premises in the city.  The business community had staged two demonstrations against the regulation.  The new board of the Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce has said it does not support a third demonstration since the first two had not done the business community any good. The Chamber also said that it had filed a case in court against the administration that it will fight on the grounds that the regulation is contrary to existing laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The three-day African Ministers of Finance conference under the theme &quot;Financial Sector Reform and Debt Management&quot; closed Wednesday at the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) with the adoption of the Addis Ababa Declaration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration encompasses growth and development finance in Africa at the turn of the century, financial sector reforms and the African debt problem, adopted by the thirty or so ministers from all around Africa acknowledged the role of multilateral financial institutions but voiced some reservations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The countries 'welcomed' the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPCs) initiative but called for the eligibility conditions and debt sustain ability analysis to be more flexible. HIPCs was launched by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank last year September targeting forty-one countries--33 of which are in Africa. The stock of debt is said to be about US$340.5 billion at the end of last year with total debt service payments amounted to US$ 24.0 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. K.Y. Amoako's statement at a press briefing Wednesday that &quot;Africa's development has to start with us,&quot; was also unsurprisingly mirrored in the declaration that highlighted the role, among other things of domestic savings and local investments efforts especially in light of the fact that official development assistance to the continent has declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference also discussed, apart from financial sector reforms, debt management and capital market development. The big question remains how to reduce dependency on aid. &quot;Foreign aid, unless Africa's development happens,&quot; was no way to go about it, Dr. Amoako remarked, adding his satisfaction &quot;at the format&quot; of the conference that was &quot;a break-through&quot; and very participatory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) has issued a report condemning the treatment of university students detained by police for taking part in a demonstration 21 March against the land redistribution system in the Amhara region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO said that 212 students out of the 500 who demonstrated failed to evade the riot police waiting for them as they entered the main road towards Arat Kilo. They were taken away to Shogele Meda ( a former arms depot) where they were detained &quot;for six days in two houses, with nothing to wear during the night except the clothes they had worn on the day of their arrest, &quot;and made to endure 'physical torture'. EHRCO stated that on the day of their arrest the students were 'punished' three times by being forced to run, &quot;bare foot on rough ground, rising up and lying down in quick successions, rolling down, crawling on all fours, walking on knees, and crouching and hopping.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Saturday until Tuesday the students were made to perform these acts three times a day. EHRCO has said it will disclose in its next regular report the names of students who suffered injuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were not brought to court, but the police took their statements and finger prints,&quot; the report stated, adding that, the students had only been given a small loaf of bread on their first night, but from then on had two pieces of bread for lunch and dinner and from 24 March onwards had injera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO noted that, &quot;the act of torture committed against the students Tis a violation of the provisions of Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was ratified by Ethiopia. These Articles provide that 'No one shall be subject to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.' It is also a violation of Article 18(1) of the FDRE Constitution, which provides that : 'Everyone has the right to protection against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At 7:00 p.m. on March 25, 1997, the Deputy Administrator of Addis Ababa, Ato Kalid Abduraman, told the detained students to admit in writing that they were wrong in taking part in the demonstration, and advised them to write a petition asking the government to pardon them,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police released Wednesday 26 March 171 of the students after they had signed a statement that read, &quot;It was wrong of us to participate in the demonstration with the knowledge that it was illegal. We agree that legal action should be taken against us if we are found taking part in an illegal demonstration henceforth. We ask for a pardon for what we have done.&quot; Of the remaining, 27 students refused to sign the petition on the grounds that it was a legal demonstration, while 14 are still being held--even though they signed--because they were said to be the coordinators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police claim that the demonstration was illegal since the students had received no permission from the Addis Ababa Administration. The government media has conveyed this message and has since giving much coverage to 'legal' demonstrations in favour of the land redistribution. However, EHRCO explains that all that was asked of the students by law was to submit an application-- which they did 18 March. &quot;Nevertheless,&quot; the report said, &quot;without following the law and informing the students in writing within 12 hours of the reason why it thinks the venue and time of the demonstration should be changed, the Administration made the law-abiding students to suffer above by claiming that it did not give permission.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EHRCO has called for all concerned individuals, organisations, and governments to call for the immediate release of the university students.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, some 102,300 tourists visited the country earning Ethiopia 179,426 million birr.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Ethiopia got 231,460 million birr. This was still no way as good as the incomes generated in neighbouring countries such as Kenya and Tanzania from the tourist industry, Amharic government daily Addis Zemen quoted. Dr. Theodros Atlabachew, head of the bureau told the association-- formed 3 years ago and with 21 members including four government hotels run by a board--that more trained personnel were needed, calling for the Hotel and Tourism Training Institute should be upgraded to a college level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian Tourism Commissioner Yousuf Abdulahi disregarded the notion that there are too many hotels in the country but highlighted the need for improvement including in the services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Dear Editor, I have been following the tourist/foreigner-in- Ethiopia debate closely as very important issues are being raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hard to imagine that Ethiopia actually wants to keep tourists out but at this stage only the most intrepid travellers seem to be able to put up with the conditions in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not wish to offend anyone as I know many self-respecting, decent and well-mannered Ethiopians, just like your last writer. What I would like to point out is that this gentleman simply cannot appreciate that the average person on the streets seems to discriminate between non-Amharic speaking, non- Ethiopian looking strangers and local people. This translates into cries of abuse, calls for money and an insistent persistence for being hired for unwanted tasks. Never before or anywhere else in the world have I felt so much like an object as opposed to a human being. If I treat others respectfully I appreciate similar treatment. I do not ask for red carpet treatment, just common decency. Unfortunately foreigners are exposed to this element when they first arrive here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visiting town with a fair-skinned Amharic speaking friend resulted in the usual rude and intrusive treatment by a group of street children. That is, until she opened her mouth and chided the kids gently for having forgotten their manners. The result was an eye-opener: they grinned sheepishly and melted away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I went to town one day with an Ethiopian friend and was shocked to see how differently these children behaved towards her. They still drummed around the car but in a friendly and normal way. Once their curiosity had been satisfied, they left us alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These experiences have highlighted the differential treatment meted out to foreigners and I doubt very much whether the outraged gentleman can be aware of this situation. Has he bothered to ask a single foreigner about his/her experiences before he wrote his letter? I would like to meet him for a cup of coffee if he is open minded enough to hear my version. Incidentally I have been stoned twice and my husband several times. Is that how Ethiopian parents teach their children to treat people who differ from them? Name withheld</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We read your article &quot;CBE's Forex Bureaus Start Operation....&quot;of 21st March 1997.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - We hear there are both organizational and staff adjustments to better serve the tax paying public and to make tax collection efficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We like to share what we know, what other countries are doing and trying to do.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first thing is hire a manager to run the tax office not a bureaucrat; and give the new boss unprecedented flexibility to hire, fire, and set pay.  The laws related to tax payment are many and confusing. Put laws related to tax in one book. At times, there are employees of Inland Revenue who are unable to explain, nor to show you the related legislation regarding the tax to which they are referring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many times both Region 14 and other regions have admitted that there are millions of birr in back taxes that have gone uncollected. Part of the reason is that the taxpayer who goes to pay taxes into the tax office is not treated properly. Sometimes it takes literally days to pay your tax. Tax offices need to be more business-like and they have to be &quot;customer oriented.&quot; Present tax collectors or the staff of Inland Revenue have an attitude that the tax payer is &quot;always dishonest.&quot; A very bad attitude that needs to be changed. Speaking frankly, simplify the tax system and treat the tax payer as an important customer.</SPAN></P>

The Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRCO) has noted that as requested by law, the students had filed an application to hold a demonstration and so it had not been an 'illegal' protest as the authorities are claiming.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Details concerning economic and financial transactions between Ethiopia and its seceded territory of Eritrea are largely off limits to researchers and other individuals interested in investigating these transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the birr is also legal tender in Eritrea, Eritrean banks create money in birr through credit which , on a fractional reserves basis, may be several times greater than the amount of any initial cash deposits. Where is the preponderant part of this credit spent? In Eritrea or in Ethiopia? Isn't it possible for, say, an Eritrean merchant who has just received a loan from an Eritrean bank to be given a cheque or a draft by the Eritrean bank to be drawn on an Ethiopian bank with which it has a line of credit?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Eritrean merchant can then travel to Ethiopia without any border checks, cash his draft at, say, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE), buy goods in Ethiopia with the credit, sell them in Ethiopia at a profit, repay his loans to the Eritrean bank and pocket the profits. Of course, the Eritrean bank would ultimately have to repay the credit it receives from its Ethiopian counterpart, but the credit could pile up indefinitely. In fact, this is exactly what is informally being reported to be actually happening, some sources indicating an accumulated credit amount fast approaching the billion- birr mark! But this cannot be denied or confirmed by the Ethiopian bureaucracy because it seems to have been gagged on the issue!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">You may also be curious to know how Eritrean banks receive cash in birr when they face cash shortages, This was once said to be unnecessary as they were overliquid. Nobody knows whether they are all still liquid. One way is the mechanism described above. We don't know whether they maintain reserve accounts with the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) which is nominally the bank of issue for the birr area. If they had such reserve accounts, cash could be sent to them by debiting such reserve accounts by an equivalent amount or some of them could be designated as issue-holding banks or branches which could hold cash reserves (on behalf of the National Bank) from which they could draw cash when faced with cash shortages, with their reserve account with the NBE being similarly debited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, again, we don't know exactly what the situation is like on this matter as such information is said to be sensitive and the concerned government and bank officials usually refrain from discussing it. But how can one expect to place economic and financial relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea on a sound footing if such important information is withheld by the bureaucracy?  Likewise, leaked information suggests that there are quite a few dubious- looking foreign exchange transfers to Eritrea by the banking system in Ethiopia such as, for example, the transfer said to be for expanding the oil refining at Assab.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear whether Ethiopia should defray investment costs for the refinery when she is no longer the owner of the property. Further, despite the surfeit of official propaganda about the good relations between Ethiopia and Eritrea, economic and financial cooperation and exchanges, ask a bank official in Ethiopia what the current official birr/dollar rate, deposit and lending rates, foreign reserves, the volume of money, the rate of monetary expansion and the fiscal deficit in Eritrea are and the most likely answer you would get would be: &quot;How on earth do you expect me to know all that 'classified' information? Even if I knew, I would immediately instruct those chips of my memory which recorded the information to self-destruct!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, it is an uphill task to obtain information from the bureaucracy on the following subjects:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the exact sources of capital for EPRDF sponsored businesses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the credit lines extended to them over the last three years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* major enterprises and individuals who/which received loans and credits from the domestic banking system and the amounts they received</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the number of urban land leases auctioned off over the last three years, revenues collected from these leases, and the names of individuals and organizations which won the lease auctions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* how proceeds from land lease auctions are being managed and the purposes to which they are being put</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* total revenues from already privatized state assets, in what accounts these revenues are being kept and for what purposes they are being used</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the number of central government and regional development projects and private business enterprises implemented in each region, project costs, employment created by these projects and output capacities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the total number of new jobs created over the last five years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the total number of new houses and buildings built in Addis Ababa and in other urban centers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* actual annual defence expenditures over the last five years</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the latest balance sheets and income statements of public enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complete or partial information details on the above and other subjects cannot be obtained from the bureaucracy even when the information is available simply because officials think or believe that something terrible would happen to them if they ever opened their mouths about them. But why all this fear and anxiety about disclosing such information which, in and of itself, can quite safely be considered to be fairly innocuous?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Individual psychology suggests that individual persons deliberately refrain from providing information about themselves and their activities when they feel deep in their hearts that some of the things they have done are wrong and any information on them would be used as evidence of guilt against them.  The same argument could, with ample justification, be extended to political regimes. But since the actions of political regimes affect society at large far more than do the actions of individuals, they are, by virtue, in principle, of their having been installed in a position of power by the people, correspondingly subject to public scrutiny far more than are individual persons who may justifiably invoke the right to privacy as a measure of immunity to such public scrutiny, although even individuals cannot escape scrutiny in cases where criminal wrongdoing is suspected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moral of the above attempt at elucidation is that economic, financial and other information should not be withheld by the bureaucracy except in very special cases where the provision of such information could materially put the security of the nation and the public at risk. This is supposed to be the age of transparency, disclosure and openness and any unjustifiable official secrecy is bound to be interpreted as a sign of guilt or wrongdoing.  On the other hand, the withholding of information is detrimental to progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, a professional economist will not be able to think out a solution to the problem of the alleged unequal common currency arrangement between Ethiopia and Eritrea if he is denied access to all the relevant qualitative and quantitative information, and if an equitable solution is not found, the now faint sense felt by one of the parties of having been wronged could develop into enmity, the consequences of which may well be catastrophic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the same token, a professional cannot propose a viable solution to the current problem of land unavailability if information on how much unused land is available, the frequency of land lease auctions, the total area of land made available monthly through this mechanism, the potential of using &quot; kebeles&quot; for land distribution, etc, is not made available to the professional concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must regard economic and financial information as the basic raw material and input for analyzing major economic problems and issues and for proposing viable solutions. The analysis may be done by the various government departments, individual researchers, specialized research institutes and think-tanks and (don't be surprised) the public at large. Only when access to official information is open can we do all this, for the benefit of society at large. What policy-and decision-makers in Ethiopia should diligently promote is a research environment where easy and prompt access to official information would deliver a set of sound alternative solutions from which they could pick and choose. The current bureaucratic paranoia about providing information is self-defeating. Therefore, the government should, without delay, take measures to make the massive amount of economic and financial information at the disposal of its bureaucracy available to professional researchers, research institutes, the private press and to all other interested parties, including the public at large. While these measures will do no harm, the amount of good they would do would be immeasurably enormous!  Ethiopian bureaucracy, don't withhold harmless information and be presumed guilty!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Many people complain that young Ethiopian artists are trying so hard to pass on a message--at a high price -- with little emphasis on basic technique that their work ends up 'heavy' and lacking that certain &quot; flare&quot; that makes one's heart miss a beat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The art exhibition of eight young Ethiopian artists--graduates of the Addis Ababa Fine Arts School in the '80s and early '90s-- at Goshu Art Gallery(29 March-15 April) though, comes very close to this 'unconventional' assessment that most of us laymen use and that would certainly offend many 'learned' artists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behailu Bezabih had six works on display, priced from 2500 to 700 birr, most with a 'light' theme. These, which included 'Modjo' and 'the son of Aba Mamo' --the lowest priced piece at the exhibition-- is balanced by a more serious theme conveyed (&quot;life is a mystery&quot;) in 'who saw the joker'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tesfaye Woldeselassie seven pieces on display (priced from 2500 to 1500 birr) show a marked inclination to traditional themes such as in 'Grinding Coffee', the 'Water Carrier'-- and in the abstract piece simply titled 'shield'. Daniel Taye and Samuel Sharew , had five (priced between 1000-3000 birr).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - &quot;...Protect children and adolescents from all forms of negligence, discrimination, exploitation, cruelty and oppression.&quot; States Article 227 from the 1989 Convention on the Right of the Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This refers to the raising of our children but does it mean that society is also responsible for those that we have not nurtured, that are not our own.  Whose responsibility are the 40,000* children that spend their days wandering the streets of Addis Ababa clutching shoe-boxes, cartons of cigarettes or simply with a hand out-stretched?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the words street-child conjure up a pathetic picture of a ragged , scarred, diseased 'untouchable', or an aggressive abusive hardened criminal, that is nothing but a burden on the community , then we are failing to comply with the international convention that Ethiopia has ratified and see these victims as children.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than that, we are being worryingly short-sighted if we do not realise that reducing the 40,000 children on our streets is part of a long-term solution to many social ills. Fewer street children means less poverty and less begging; less children resorting to criminal behaviour to support themselves so a safer environment and a less fearing community. Neither would so many girls resort to prostitution for an income - less child exploitation and rape; with this, so would we limit the spread of HIV and AIDS. Most of all, we would not be nurturing people to rely upon society's support - that escalating circle of dependency would be broken. Simplistic maybe, but those major social problems could be significantly reduced if we agreed to take constructive action and responsibility for the coming generation of homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is another side to street children. They are a nuisance. You become inhumanely hardened to the big, doleful eyes staring pleadingly up at you or the more aggressive attitudes. Constant callings, shrieking, swearing, eradicates your sympathy; catching hold of you and sticking a fist into your bag makes you even less willing to help. For farenji, the hassles from street children are even more acute. Of course, they believe foreigners to be rich, possibly a route out of their seemingly doomed existence. They can be less sure that habbasha will give them money - nationals are, apparently just as likely to give them a kick. Abera in Piazza explained that some tourists have shown violence to him and his friends. The reason?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well,&quot; I was told as if it was blatantly obvious, &quot;the foreigners that treat us like that are just crazy ! They expect foreigners to delve into their pockets and produce the goods and it's difficult to refuse knowing that they might not get any more bread that day. However this only endorses their misconception that all foreigners are infinitely wealthier than their Ethiopian counterpart, it makes walking the streets more restricting for foreigners and it hardly encourages the potentially affluent tourism industry here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trouble is, that the type of help that the children receive is not properly organised or monitored. Tourists have handed out sterling notes and dollar bills. Dawit proudly displays his swanky digital watch, a gift from some thoughtful Americans. We too are escalating the problem. Doling out money does nothing to constructively relieve the suffering on the streets.  According to GOAL-Ethiopia's research, few children take the money to their families. It would be better to give donations to organisations that can constructively tackle the issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, street children are not the burden that we assume they are. Those children do have things to offer - lots, but we've failed to cultivate it.  that's 40,000 minds and imaginations that are redundant. Had they been born into more fortunate positions, what would they have made of their lives and given to society?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike us, children etching a living from the street do not see their future as hopeless. They still hold aspirations. Dawit Yirga, who must be one of the sparkiest kids roaming Arat Kilo, is working to be a doctor. GOAL children hope to be masons, labourers, businessmen and even pilots. They seem to know better than most their objectives in life. It illustrates that given the chance, they would contribute to, not be a drain upon society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is essential to see past the &quot;street kids facade.&quot; To see them playing at the GOAL Drop-in-Centre, they are ordinary adolescents: being child-like, competitive, laughing, cheering each other on, encouraging. They seem very supportive of each other, a replica of 'normal' society. In fact, they are probably better at functioning in society than most of us, since they always operate in groups to share out money and protect each other. The problem arises when we try to integrate them into a society with such ingrained prejudices against them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solutions? Horrendous stories circulate: children are taken out of Addis to areas accessible at night, such as Wolleka, Shashemene, Debre Zeit, to be dumped and left prey to the maulings of hyenas. One child told me how he had managed to jump out of the truck he had been jostled into at the traffic lights. Two boys wandered into GOAL, feverish with malaria; they said that they had hitched back from Goffa where they had been stranded fifteen days earlier. Others are not so lucky. Unofficial sources have even suggested that up to 1000 children are carted off each month. Even if these are just rumours - despite the evidence to prove they are not - they highlight the problem. That children are roaming the streets at night; that children need protection from abuse and that there is something, be it older street gangs, the public or formal institutions, that children are very, very frightened of.  No child whatever their history, should be exposed to this. This sort of solution hardly makes use of all that the children have to offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been more constructive help given to street children. In 1990, a mobile unit was formed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in conjunction with Radda Barna, to help provide support for poor families. The government is aware of the problem, it is motivating international NGOs to support indigenous NGOs in tackling the issue of children on the streets.  Although it conducted a nation-wide survey eighteen months ago to give technical advice, it does not have the resources to do much itself. It does run some form of night shelter in the worst areas such as around the Mercarto, Meskal Square and Cherkos, where children pay between 75 cents and three birr per night. Just to sleep in safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF together with University College Cork, in Ireland conducted an extensive survey of street children, but that was in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly recruited police are being trained at the Kolfe Police Training Centre to see children as vulnerable, requiring protection and help.  Hopefully this will soon be incorporated into the national police-training curriculum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HOPE Enterprises provides day-to-day relief with a feeding centre on Churchill Road which provides on average, 500 meals per day to those lucky enough to receive a meal ticket from a passer-by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOAL-Ethiopia, one of the few NGOs dealing with hard-core street-children, runs a drop-in-centre to keep children off the street during the day. Medical, educational, washing, counseling and meal services are provided, as well as job-training and placements. A savings scheme encourages children to learn how to use their money. Three night shelters can accommodate 75 children and altogether, 369 are registered in their programme. But as they are well aware, this is by no means enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most NGOs focus on methods to prevent children taking to the streets, such as Terre des hommes, Lausanne's Disrupted Families project. Forum on Street Children is the only well-promoted, indigenous NGO devoted solely to helping street children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this identifies is that there is dispersed help but it is not far- reaching enough. No-one is capable of successfully working alone in this issue: if NGOs, the government, private organisations and society, all entered into support together, pooled their resources; if everyone was determined to make a concerted effort, together, solutions could be more easily solved, funds more easily found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem lies with us, with the community, with refusal to accept that these children are the victims of our war-torn past. It is our attitudes that have to change. It is time that we stopped blaming the children for their situations, stopped viewing them as unsettled trouble-makers that are unreconcilable with society. If every business and company in Addis Ababa took the initiative to take on just one street child as a trainee, it would take 100s if not 1000s off the streets, opening up possibilities of employment. Projects involving the community are vital. Schemes such as Terre des hommes' plan to initiate a bed-and-breakfast service using the residents of Addis TAbaba, or the already functioning GOAL library service open not just to GOAL children and staff but to members of the local community and run by volunteers from the kebele are the way forward to draw these estranged vagrants back into our world. As Ato Bekele, the manager of GOAL's street children project, stated:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Awareness and advocacy of street children is very low. This is an issue which must be addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The street children at GOAL said they wanted to help other street children, to provide clothes, food and shelter, to rehabilitate and share the skills they have learned, when they grow up. We cannot wait that long. It is up to all of us to be committed to bring about change and now, before any more lives are wasted. It needs mass promotion and national corroboration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, we cannot guarantee that those 8-15 year olds will ever get themselves into a position where they are able to provide others with the opportunities that they have received through GOAL, but they are determined not to remain the way they are. And we must be as committed and resolute as they are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whose responsibility are they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the duty of the family, of society and state to guarantee children and adolescents with absolute priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Surveys by MOLSA, UNICEF and GOAL-Ethiopia put the official number of street children at between 25-40,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian Economic Association (EEA) held a roundtable discussion on the interrelationship between culture and economic development on March 20, 1997 at the National Hotel here in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the distinguished academics and other intellectuals present were Dr.  Yonas Admassu, Ato Tekalege Gedamu, Dr. Yeraswork Admassie and Dr. Berhanu Nega, who is the current president of the EEA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Yonas Admassu, a lecturer at the Institute of Language Studies of A. A.  University, made the observations quoted below:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Scholars and policy makers are much inclined to make esoteric discourses on development without taking into account cultural influences on economic development. Subtle implications of Ethiopia's heterogeneous cultures and sub- cultures for socio-economic development do not fit into the multiple sets of economic models which have much more to do with western realities than with the peculiar socio-cultural assets of the country. Though we usually try to think of economic development in terms of statistics and figures, lack of sound understanding of the complex cultural values makes our efforts to bring about economic development futile in most cases.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On his part, Ato Tekalegn Gedamu, Chief Executive Officer of Abyssinia Bank, had the following to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ethiopia's long standing practice of administration, well-developed social values and quality of human resources could be regarded in a positive sense as valuable assets, which could be harnessed towards the attainment of socio- economic progress. However, some social traits have been abused for too long and governments are generally bent on ruling rather than administering people judiciously. The culture of envy, the still undeveloped tradition of thrift and the like have posed obstacles to economic progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, Dr. Yeraswork of the Dept. of Sociology and Social Anthropology , A. A. University, made the following incisive comments:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One serious impediment to socio-economic development is the lack of a favouable political and economic environment which discourages those who want to work. The obstacle is not only the existence of people who do not want to work but also the prevalence of an unfavorable climate which frustrates those who are able and interested to work. There should be a well-defined system of incentives and accountability which would encourage those who want to commit themselves to constructive ventures. Bureaucratic red-tape should be curtailed and the law should provide protection for entrepreneurial individuals. Such malpractices as nepotism, favoritism, corruption and patronage should be eradicated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The EEA's recognition of the importance of the interrelationship between culture and economic development should be greatly appreciated. Ethiopians who have had the privilege and advantage of modern education are generally aware of the negative influences of culture as they are generally speaking in a position to compare traditional social culture with modern social culture which they have come to know through their education. One of the remarkable features of traditional social culture in Ethiopia is the persistence of its influence even on those who are educated. One such influence, inherited from traditional church schools, is the inability to accept the possibility of being excelled by others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In traditional church schools, outstanding &quot;Kine&quot; (double entendre) scholars are so much envied by less gifted pupils that their lives are often at risk, frequently being poisoned by those whose envy assumes homicidal proportions. The same is also true of competition in the political arena where ambitious individuals resort to force of arms to gain political ascendancy. Hence, in Ethiopia what may be termed a warrior culture is deeply embedded in the cultural consciousness of the society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negative influences of the deep-rooted culture of envy are also clearly manifested in the economic and commercial sphere where smear campaigns are run against economically successful people by less successful ones although the manner of acquisition of wealth by the former may be perfectly legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the fatalism of the broad masses poses a paradox which is quite difficult to unravel. This has led some to make the general observation that envy and &quot;warriorism&quot; are much more pronounced among social elite groups, be they traditional or modern, than among the vast majority of the Ethiopian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, since the social elite groups are products of the society at large it would constitute a contradiction to contend that the masses are devoid of envy and the warrior culture. A more accommodating line of reasoning would be to regard envy as the antithesis of fatalism in a society where both co-exist.  A negative reaction against those who have succeeded in life which is thought to be essentially pre-determined by fate is quite possible in a dialectically dual co-existence. So, envy may be seen as a conscious or unconscious revolt against fatalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Generally, several more negative cultural traits in the Ethiopia society could be identified besides &quot;warriorism&quot; and green envy, including the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* excessive conformity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* religiosity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* over-dependence on parents, relatives and on the society at large ( the latter giving rise to high social dependency)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* indolence and lethargy (especially in urban culture)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* docility</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* pretentiousness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* distrust of intellectual investigation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* unworldliness (as manifested in downgrading of material possessions)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* subjective reasoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* excessive gossiping and backbiting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* conspicuous consumption to impress others (related to pretentiousness)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* duplicity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* bribe-taking and giving</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* nepotism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ethnocentrism</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, an Ethiopian sitting at a dinner table with other Ethiopians would find it embarrassing to be the first one to start eating. Similarly, educated Ethiopians discussing work-related matters with their bosses would rather not risk offending the bosses by saying something opposed to the bosses' ideas.  Religiosity may be manifested in not working on all the Saints' Days which, according to some estimates, may number as many as 270 in a single year!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overdependence shows up in lack of critical and independent thinking and in social dependency, including the culture of begging. Non-nutritional manifestations of indolence and lethargy originate from the cultural traits of fatalism and unworldliness. Docility emanates from fatalism, acceptance of the natural order of things and as protection against potential retaliation for covert envy and coveting which may be discovered by the envied.  Pretentiousness is everywhere to be seen in Ethiopian culture. A hungry Ethiopian may refuse an invitation to a glorious meal lest he should be judged as one who has not enough to eat at home. A girl may spurn the advances of a boy she secretly admires for fear that he may think her to be cheap. Lavish weddings prepared to impress guests have bankrupted many couples and parents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negative consequences of all these generally undesirable cultural traits on economic development have been obvious enough. Leaders who take political power by force (warriorism) very often refuse to work and cooperate with people who are much better educated, more experienced and intellectually more gifted for fear that they may be outshined by them (envy), with dire implications for the formulation of sound and practicable economic policy.  Ethiopian leaders often equate setbacks in intellectual arguments with defeats in battle. Similarly, the negative consequences of the cultural traits of indolence, religiosity, overdependence, excessive conformity and conspicuous consumption on output and productivity, the degree of social dependency, entrepreneurial initiative and domestic savings have been quite significant although the extent of their influence may be difficult to quantify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What should we do about all these bad cultural trails? The task of doing something about them squarely rests with the elite groups, especially the modern ones. &quot;Warriorism&quot; as a means of access to political power should be replaced by free and fair elections; envy of the green type should give way to constructive competition; getting to know a prospective marriage partner should not take an eternity because of cultural pretentiousness and getting married should be no more than a ten-guest and a-hundred-birr affair! So the advice would be:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Work hard, get married simply, continue to work hard for your family's and your own sake (and, one should add, your country's sake), and if you are politically ambitious and have the qualities needed, try to get elected by majority vote. Say your prayers everyday, but don't use sham prayer and worship as a cover-up for indolence. By all means, make money, but don't steal it by any means. Let merit be your guiding principle and eschew favourtism of all kinds. Try to keep fit and healthy so that you may do all these yet another day&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Lifts breaking down are usual occurrences, but their significance is magnified when you find yourself having to walk up eleven floors. So when I finally made it to the apartment of film maker Mohammed Idris, it was with a slight reluctance that I shifted my attention from my cold drink to the video deck where his wife, Halima Mussa was putting on the &quot; Dawn of Hope&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;Dawn of Hope&quot;, a documentary directed and produced by Mohammed Idris won the Magna Matre at the World Film Festival 1985 in Czechoslovakia organised under the theme &quot;Bread and Peace&quot;. Revolving around the 1984 Ethiopian famine, the film would certainly be regarded as a 'propaganda' piece had it not been for a unique blend of the tragedies of famine and searching for an explanation as to why it occurs in the land of the Nile.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, that was not the best film he had done, Mohammed is quick to say.  Retired from the Ministry of Information since 1994, Mohammed's involvement as a consultant in the new film &quot;Endurance&quot; ife of the renown track-star Haile Gebresellasie makes this statement understandable. Hard though it might be to believe, working with Haile was not what made Mohammed say, &quot;Really Allah loves me,&quot; when he first heard of the project. What got him so excited was the chance to work with the director Leslie Woodhead --with whom he had made three other films including &quot;Kwegu&quot; (about a little known tribe in Ethiopia) that won first prize in 1985 at the Festival de Luchon Grand Prix Du festival in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After I had signed the contract, Leslie said, 'The ball is in your hands Mohammed' and so I went and I could not sleep.&quot; Mohammed felt a big responsibility weighing down on him and said to himself, &quot;Leslie is alien to our culture so I must bear all the responsibility. This is a project (that) I shouldn't work for money.&quot; So when Leslie Woodhead gave him a rough outline of the script, Mohammed had to, in his own words, &quot;invent the cultural aspects (with) Haile as the central character with all 'Ethiopianness' revolving around him. To show Haile as a rural 'geter' boy and his mother as a real Ethiopian 'geter' woman. To depict not as a single individual woman but a character (that) depicts Ethiopian women fully and Ethiopian rural life.  The very difficult scene that Leslie had thought would be was the funeral service (for Haile's mother) but that went well. We had to bring a coffin and put stones in it and we had to bring 'alkash' mourners. We brought in relatives and they started shedding their tears and it became perfect.&quot; What Woodhead had brought with him on August 1996 was really the bare outline as Mohammed shows the papers with dates and a line or two scribbled next to them reveal. But this was the way Woodhead usually worked and Mohammed was not surprised. &quot;When we were shooting 'Kwegu' we flew from here by helicopter and landed at the Omo river. And we don't know whether our characters are there or not leave alone the cinematic aspects of the film. The anthropologists asked for a few characters--they were there--we took off all the gears (and) the helicopter went. It came back after a month and we had a brilliant film.&quot; His appreciation of Woodhead is returned as can be seen from the latter's observation as written in his book &quot;A box full of spirit&quot;. &quot;He (Mohammed)&quot; Woodhead wrote,&quot; was one of those people with a talent for friendship.  Walking down a street in Addis with Mohammed was like strolling through a familiar village. In the bank, a dramatic circular tower like a trendy cathedral, he moved quickly between embraces and hellos to track down our bundles of low denomination notes, vital for porterage and gifts. At the Red Cross offices, more handshakes and we'd come away with two huge tents.  Permits and paraffin, Mohammed had fixed it all. But his major achievement was the helicopter.&quot; Mohammed's dark face loses its huge perfect smile when he mentions that he had lost the certificate for his part in 'Kwegu' following the confusion after the death of his first wife Bezunesh Bekele-- one of the country's leading singers. But the cloud soon lifts from his face as making himself comfortable on the sofa, he talks about his career that has made him a household name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in 1941, Addis Ababa, Mohammed Mussa Idris graduated from the then Haile Selassie University in 1968 with an advanced diploma in Amharic and English. He then taught in elementary and high school for the following seven years before taking an intensive one year radio journalism diploma course.  Mohammed does not see this move in the light of an unpredictable career change. &quot;I can't say it was mere luck,&quot; Mohammed remarks, &quot;because it was my educational background--English and Amharic composite major-that really pushed me to journalism. The other thing is I am somewhat a poet. I won first prize in a poetry competition in the university. I was also president of the Ethiopian Muslim Students Association. I was so popular and people were encouraging me as a poet and as a writer. I was also writing for the Addis Zemen before joining the Ministry of Information.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he joined Radio Ethiopia as head of the Amharic section, Mohammed introduced the programme 'Know Your Country' -- a programme that made his reputation. Getting the chance to travel extensively, Mohammed wrote for Menen magazine and contributed to television as well--and co-produced programmes with for example with Addis Ababa Bank. Also responsible for the broadcast of special programmes (on holidays and such) Mohammed found himself having to do some quick thinking before presenting what was to be his best piece. The feature in question was about Emperor Theodros to be broadcast on his hundredth anniversary. However, Theodros was not a favorite of Emperor Haile Selassie, Mohammed noted, and those heads who knew the young journalist's desire to bring forward 'provocative' programmes would not let this pass. After putting it off for three years, Mohammed finally got his chance. One day his boss flew to France on Ethiopian Airlines' inaugural flight and the timing was perfect as it coincided with the 103 anniversary of Theodros. So Mohammed approached Negash Gebremariam who loved the programme but stated that he was worried about one part where Catholicism (an accusory statement referring to the wearing of modern clothes) was mentioned. There was no time to take a close look at the programme and so when the latter went to lunch, Mohammed went to the deputy to tell him he had received the go- ahead. The programme was a success and the studio received many calls including one from Gondar that inquired whether &quot;his majesty was still on the throne.&quot; Not surprising then that the studio heard from the prime minister and Mohammed was told by his bosses, &quot;Its a good programme but don't repeat it.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the revolution came though, the staff found themselves not only 'confined' to their programme but under bosses that knew little about the work. &quot;We had 'guards' no 'bosses',&quot; Mohammed said, &quot;and we had to teach them about film, about radio, about production. It is very hard to explain to them what you are making. It is heavier than the production itself.&quot; In 1975 though, Mohammed was unwillingly transferred to television where he was made current affairs head. He remembers being called to the office by one of his seniors and told, &quot;Look Mohammed, you are very good in radio--that means you are good in sound. If you just add pictures you will be a filmmaker.&quot; So Mohammed traveled to the war front with cameraman Elias Birru to make documentaries for the government. And at the back of his head was his own documentary, 'The scare of war' that would show the war for what it was without taking sides. Another idea for a film made following Woodhead's 'formula' for a 'drama doc' has also been shelved for the time being.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The events were moving so fast and I was always moving with (them).&quot; Once, Mohammed was asked to do a photographic exhibition under the title &quot;Peace&quot;.  But he found that when he finished one chapter and felt ready to stage the exhibition , he was told the situation was different. After he was asked to change it three times, Mohammed did what he considered to be a great blunder for someone who was a member of the Blue Nile Toastmasters and so knew about communication--he blew up at the minister. Mohammed was not punished for his outburst but rather compensated. He was given the chance to go to England to produce a BBC 'under the sun' trilogy--A woman who smiles, Duca and Gadi go hunting, and Our way of living. These were based on the life of the Hamer tribe and won several anthropological awards. Mohammed was also involved in the making of three films in the Granada Disappearing World Series--The Migrant, The land is bad, and Nitha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man with extensive experience in film making in Ethiopia and with still much to offer, Mohammed is unsure about the country's new crop of would-be film makers. And it is not only the high expense involved that has added him to the long list experts who do not see an 'heir' in sight. &quot;I see one obstacle,&quot; he noted, &quot;Whenever there is a setting it is always a bunna bet (a drinking house). They don't choose good sites. Always they talk about relationships of male and female. Always they show love--that is good I am not against love--but when a man loves a woman and a woman loves a man you show the life style of these two. But they don't show you why she loves that man. Everything is superficial. They don't show the effort that he makes or she makes in his or her work.&quot; But not everything is wrong with what the young generation Tis doing. &quot;I see better techniques than in my time,&quot; Mohammed added, &quot;so by the time they reach my age I am sure these youngsters will make a good film.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - On Sidist-Kilo Campus of A.A. University there is little to show for the government's professed commitment to greater investment in human capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The buildings are generally in a poor state of repair. The library (Kennedy Memorial Library) is overcrowded and poorly lit. The periodicals section of the library is laughable, pathetically cluttered with nothing more than dirty and crumpled local newspapers. None of the well-known international newspapers and magazines such as the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Guardian&quot;, the &quot; Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; are visible anywhere in the room.  Most of the visible stocks of books are mouldy with age. Computers seem to be unheard of here.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, students try to make the most of what is available. They are dour and quiet. Humping over their notes and books, they look quite industrious and intent. It is difficult, though, to fathom what is going on in their minds. Do they have the elementary and secondary educational background to cope with the demands of higher education? How are their language skills? Do they find it difficult to understand everything they read? Is their mathematics strong enough to enable them to grapple with differential and integral calculus? Is their approach to acquiring knowledge based largely on rote memory or have they developed the mental skills to work out problems on the basis of creative and logical reasoning? What is their average IQ? Do they get adequate nutrition commensurate with the enormous intellectual efforts expected of them? Do they have reasonably decent accommodation? Is there anybody, like a psychological counselling expert, to give them tips on how to manage their personal lives and say some comforting words when they are faced with emotional crises?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or maybe they are just too tough to require any such schmaltzy treatment!  However, all the questions raised above are of great relevance to the objective of creating a national intelligentsia of the right caliber, because in education quality is much more important than quantity. Students do not become academic superstars by miracle. To attain such a status, they must be taught by good teachers and must have access to good educational and supportive facilities? For example how many of them have heard of the Internet and how many know that they can now use it as an important source of information? How do you expect them to have heard of Dolly (the first ever animal (a sheep) cloned from a mature cell) if they are not provided with international newspapers and magazines such as the ones mentioned above. Talk to them about the &quot;millennium bomb&quot; and don't be surprised to see at least some of them look blank. Similarly, you can't blame a student for saying in English, &quot;I haven't many money so I can't to buy many furniture&quot; if he or she was taught English in high school by a person who had only a smattering of the language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The price of not investing sufficiently in the development of human resources can be very high in terms of forfeited economic and social growth.  With little or no economic growth, resources available for human resources development become even more meagre. This in turn negatively affects economic growth, setting in motion a perniciously vicious circle. Politics often stands in the way of creating the necessary awareness about the importance of realizing the true value of human resources development. Educated and experienced people may be relegated to the fringes of the decision-making process by less educated and experienced people for fear that they may become dangerous political competitors. This in fact may be thought of as being the first link in the circular chain of human resources underdevelopment. With the best and the brightest barred from the decision-making process, the economy is often mismanaged and growth is arrested, making it impossible to make more resources available for investment in human capital. In turn, this undermines the quality of education and training, demeaning the role of educated, trained and experienced people. This becomes a bogus justification for not paying all that much attention to human resources development. Then people would dare to say: &quot;The university has been around for about fifty years, but the standard of living of the people in the country has been declining during almost all those years. What price university education? It is better to be a &quot;weyalla&quot; and earn more!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So the first logical step to augment investment in human capital in Ethiopia would be to demonstrate, in no uncertain terms, the power of quality education and work experience by concretely showing what well-trained and experienced personnel can do in terms of bringing about economic prosperity in the country such has been the experience of the South-East Asian countries, where mostly technocrats and talented people are in the driver's seat. We need to have our &quot;wonder boys&quot; and girls in agriculture, industry and finance.  Not that such &quot;wonder boys&quot; do not sometimes drive the economy to the ground ( remember the Mexican financial crisis?) , but on average their track-record is one of indisputable distinction. One of the good qualities of most well- educated officials is that when they make mistakes, they can quickly trace where they have gone wrong and often offer apologies and resignations!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But who is going to realize the immense potential lying hidden in the toiling university students at Sidist Kilo and improve the facilities available to them so that they may one day become our &quot;wonder boys and girls&quot; ? The task falls squarely on the shoulders of those at the helm. They must bring about tangible economic prosperity, through comprehensive economic growth and development, and not be satisfied with self-deceiving showcases of sham economic well-being. To do this, well-educated and experienced personnel should be fully integrated into the decision-making process at all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, though, there are quite a few small things we can do to improve the facilities on Sidist-kilo campus. Here they are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* improve access to periodical, newspaper and magazine information in the periodical section of Kennedy Library by making arrangements with the foreign community in Addis Ababa to kindly make such publications available after use;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* improve the poor lighting in the library by replacing done-for light bulbs and grimy shades which blot out the light</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Give the buildings a fresh coating of paint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Work out schemes whereby computers could be used to facilitate the work at the book circulation desks;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* create conditions whereby students may have easy access to the services of the Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These may sound like very small improvements, but they would go a long way towards making life more tolerable on Sidist-kilo campus. For bigger improvements, we need a much larger budget allocation and this can only come from the higher-ups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The secretary-general of the Organisation of African Unity, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, arrived in Kaduna State, Nigeria on March 29th, to attend the opening ceremony of the 7th OAU/AEC All-Africa Trade Fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In statements at the ceremony, Salim called upon the African Business Community to take full advantage of the fair. he urged member states to buy each other's goods and stressed the need to allow &quot;bona fide&quot; African business people to travel freely within the various regions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Salim further noted that for African goods and people to move freely throughout the continent, Africa needed, without delay, to address the problem of transport and communication facilities. Convinced that Intra- African trade was the most feasible strategy of launching Africa into the emerging international economic order characterised by liberalisation, competition and globalisation, the secretary-general called for a reassessment of policies and strategies affecting Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's Trade Fair is unique in that it has, for the first time, a component of the tourism and travel sector. Dr. Salim called upon organisers of a Workshop on Tourism Development in Africa to endeavour to come up with implementable recommendations for the benefit of Member States interested in doing business in this sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The OAU head also advised participants of the Women in Business Workshop scheduled for April 4, to assist in ways in which women entrepreneurs could build upon their remarkable success in cross-border trade and business activities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement from the Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, April 8, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(The following summary of the applications, and the main points of the decisions and reasons therefor, is given purely to assist those journalists needing a quick initial summary of the applications and is not a binding document with any legal status.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Truth and Reconciliation Commission announces the granting of amnesty to three African National Congress members from North-West Province and to a Conservative Party and Volksfront member from the Eastern Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also announces the denial of amnesty to two applicants from the Free State, one an ANC member who killed a municipal policeman and the other a man who took part in a &quot;gruesome and brutal attack&quot; on people whom he alleged were suspected to be IFP members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty has been granted to Peter Lebona, Thabo Solomon Lekitlane and Elias Busakwe, ANC members from Kanana, Orkney, who killed Zenzile Charles Dlamini, the leader of a vigilante group in their township who admitted sexually assaulting a woman, in July 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also been granted to Saint Michael Schutte, a Conservative Party and Volksfront member from Stutterheim, Eastern Cape, for possession of seven AK- 47s and 235 rounds of ammunition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty was refused to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Derrick Tshidiso Kobue, an ANC member who killed Bothetsa Sekatame, a municipal policeman, in Kroonstad in December 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- Justice Sekgopa, who took part in the killing of Shelly Erica Basson, Anthony , Mark Casey, Johannes P van Niekerk and Michael F Belelie at Mashongoville in the Odendaalsrus district in September 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the cases follow:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Peter Lebona, Thabo Solomon Lekitlane and Elias Busakwe:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three men have been serving 10-year jail sentences for the murder of Dlamini, who was at one stage also a member of the ANC but later established a vigilante group called Kofifi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amnesty Committee noted in the reasons for its decision that evidence had been led of various acts of harassment in the form of assault and rape committed by Dlamini, predominantly on members of the ANC and its Women's League. The applicants contended that they perceived Dlamini's gang to be collaborating with police, and that they suspected the gang was aided and abetted by the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee said it was common cause that when Lebone and Lekitlane were taking Dlamini to the local police station -- after the latter had admitted sexually assaulting an elderly woman and grievously assaulting her husband -- Dlamini pulled out a gun. Before Dlamini could fire, Lebone fired a shot at him, using a firearm which Busakwe had supplied earlier. Then Lekitlane had stabbed Dlamini with a knife. Other members of a group accompanying Dlamini to the police station also took part in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee found:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given the above facts, it is quite evident that the deceased and his gang disrupted meetings of the ANC, thereby impeding the ANC in their exercise of free political activity. They committed atrocious acts against members of the ANC and were generally perceived as an anathema in the community. The local community and the ANC leadership perceived them as collaborating with the local police to inhibit them from exercising free political activity in the township.  We therefore find that the primary aim of the deceased's group was to and did in fact impede members of the ANC from exercising free political activity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee said the killing of Dlamini by Lebone and Lekitlane was &quot;an act associated with a political objective&quot; and accordingly granted amnesty.  It said although Busakwe did not physically take part in the killing, he admitted facts which connected him to the murder, and he complied with the requirements for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Saint Michael Schutte</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schutte did not appear at a public hearing of the Amnesty Committee because his offence was not a gross violation of human rights, as defined in the legislation governing the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He bought the AK-47s on a visit to Mozambique in September 1993, and was arrested carrying them at the Lebombo border post upon his return to South Africa on September 28. He was due to have stood trial in Nelspruit this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in his amnesty application that the weapons were bought with the intention of defending the white community of Stutterheim in the event of a civil war after the 1994 election, and of promoting the aims of the right- wing parties to which he belonged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Justice Sekgopa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sekgopa is serving 27 years' imprisonment on four counts of murder and one count of malicious damage to property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing the evidence, the Committee said Sekgopa and other members of a crowd attacked the victims with pangas, knives, sjamboks and other weapons.  Ms Basson's genitals and breasts were mutilated. The Committee said:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was submitted on behalf of the Applicant that his motive for participating in the gruesome and brutal attack on the deceased was that he believed that the deceased were members of the Inkatha Freedom Party who had come to attack his community...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Committee has grave difficulties with this argument because there is no shred of evidence to suggest that the Applicant and/or his co-assailants could have believed that the deceased were members of the IFP at all....&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After reviewing the evidence in relation to perceptions about the IFP, the Committee said it was &quot;quite evident that the Applicant committed the offences for which he has applied for amnesty in an indiscriminate manner against private individuals.&quot; The Committee continued:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This was a clear case of mob violence in which the applicant participated.  There was no suggestion of prior common purpose on the part of the participants. We accordingly cannot accept the evidence of the applicant when questioned, that he participated in the attack in order to kill apartheid.  There had been no prior discussion or agreement amongst the participants to achieve any political objective. Furthermore, the nature of the attack was such that there was no proportionality between it and the supposed political objective, namely, sending a message to the Government that apartheid be abolished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  Derrick Tshidiso Kobue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee said evidence in this application was that Mr Sekatame had intervened in an argument between Kobue and his girlfriend in a restaurant/shebeen and threatened Kobue with a gun. Kobue, an ANC Youth League and Self-Defence Unit member, had run away and, when Mr Sekatame emerged from the restaurant, Kobue had his comrades had followed him and stabbed him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee noted that Kobue advanced as a reason for the killing the fact that the deceased was a policeman and that some policemen co-operated with the Three Million Gang, a declared enemy of the ANC in Kroonstad. Kobue also testified that the killing was on instructions from his commander in the Self-Defence Unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee found:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reason advanced by the Applicant for the killing, namely that he had killed him because he was a policeman and collaborated with the Three Million Gang, seems improbable...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Committee said it had no other evidence before it in the case, and went on to examine the Applicant's evidence more closely. It concluded:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is nothing in the advanced reasons that could have given the applicant any reason reasonably to conclude that the deceased was a collaborator with the Three Million Gang, nor that he was perceived to be an enemy of the ANC and its structures by virtue of his office as a policeman and this evidence is accordingly rejected.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANJUL, Gambia (PANA) - Authorities in the Greater Banjul area have introduced measures to reduce threats posed by the proliferation of used batteries which degrade the environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Used and decayed batteries, which are abundant in many African urban centers, ooze chemicals which cause mental retardation in children, thereby hampering their progress in school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental authorities in the Kanifing Municipal Council (KMC), a suburb of the Gambian capital, have erected metal containers at strategic points where people can dump used batteries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These containers are about a meter above the ground and have an accessible hole at one side. The rectangular shaped containers are clearly marked &quot;KMC Battery Disposal Bins.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative is significant in that it may well be the first of its kind in the sub-region. The scheme is being run by Gamworks agency and the National Environment Agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gamworks, more often referred to as AGETIP in French speaking African states, was set up by government to administer World Bank funds allocated to urban development projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coordinator for technical services at the National Environment Agency, Modou Sarr, says the batteries would later be collected from the metal boxes and transported to a final dump site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarr said that in order to ensure greater environmental safety and security, the huge hole that serves as a dump would be reinforced with internal concrete walls to hold the decomposing batteries, thereby protect neighborhood environments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The site will be located away from human settlements to ensure better protection of the population against known hazards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facility is estimated to cost 109,000 dalasi (about 10,900 U.S. dollars) of which Gamworks contributed 80 percent and the environmental agency the remaining 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarr said the scheme was mooted by a German woman in Kololi, just outside Banjul, who first took the initiative of collecting used batteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She sought and received help from school children whom she paid money whenever they brought her used batteries collected in and around the vicinity of Kololi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sarr said the woman succeeded in collecting a large quantity of such batteries for which no proper storage had been found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the Bakoteh refuse dump was found unsuitable for the batteries, which contain dangerous chemicals such as cadium, mercury and lead,&quot; Sarr said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the KMC provided a shed where the batteries were temporarily stored while awaiting the final construction of the permanent facility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expounding on the dangers of used batteries, Sarr said &quot;small children who usually play with batteries are certainly unaware of the dangers inherent in both mercury and lead.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this lack of awareness had, in the past, been the main factor preventing the required cooperation between institutions and the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he remains optimistic that with the project firmly in place, Banjul residents will respond positively to rid their city of the harmful batteries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If huge sales were made, the cost of the drugs would fall, benefiting all, including the pharmaceutical companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A regional grouping would also benefit anesthetists in the field of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muzenda said because rewards outside the universities were great, many academics were always leaving for greener pastures. Academics, particularly in medicine, made considerable financial sacrifices in order to study their subjects and teach them to the leaders of tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In Africa, if academics find themselves financially unable to provide what most professional people accept as their due, such as a car and a house for themselves, they will either moonlight or, if they are more honest, leave the job altogether,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The congress, being attended by anesthetists from all over the world, is the first to be held in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - A ministerial meeting of the Non- Aligned Movement (NAM) opened Monday in New Delhi, India, during which South Africa is expected to assume leadership of the 113-nation group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From New Delhi, the South African High Commission in India, said that African delegates had endorsed South Africa to take over from Colombia, whose Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia has already met with Alfred Nzo, South Africa's Foreign Minister.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzo, who arrived in India on Saturday, has also met with various other foreign ministers. He has participated in an informal meeting of former NAM summit hosts, including Indonesia, India, Egypt, Cuba, Algeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Sri Lanka and Colombia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Great excitement was expressed about the prospect of South Africa hosting the next NAM summit towards the end of 1998,&quot; the High Commission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New Delhi ministerial meeting will be discussing the envisaged restructuring of the United Nations -- especially the expansion and role of its Security Council, which President Nelson Mandela is adamant should be more representative of NAM member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues will include total nuclear disarmament; better utilization of potential and resources by developing countries; efforts to ensure that developing countries are equitable partners in the the process of globilization; and coordinated efforts to preserve the global ecological balance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - The Organization of African Unity said Monday that African could succeed in confronting the challenges of conflict and economic integration if they employed good government and the rule of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If efforts at achieving peace, development and integration are to succeed in Africa, Salim Ahmed Salim said, &quot;our countries should also ensure speedy promotion of good governance, characterized by accountability, probity, transparency, equal application of the rule of law, and clear separation of powers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He termed this elements as &quot;an objective and a condition for rapid and sustainable development.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, the secretary-general of the organization, was addressing the opening session of the 20th ordinary session of the O.A.U. Labor and Social Commission, a tripartite organ of the continental body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-day meeting will deliberate on employment, enhancing productivity and women's empowerment in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said confronting the challenges of peace and other development issues calls for addressing squarely the scourge of conflicts in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that conflicts in Burundi, eastern Zaire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, and Sudan were &quot;a big drain on the scarce resources that Africa can ill-afford to lose.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, he said, could take the cue from Europe, the Americas and Asia to cope with &quot;the other important challenge confronting our continent&quot; -- economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said pooling resources to be competitive in the world market required the participation and close involvement of all African interest groups: the government, workers and employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the International Labor Organization also appealed for governments to provide an environment for economic reforms that will sweep away unemployment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's chief of administration and conference services division, Jacques Diouf, told the gathering that Africa's officially recorded unemployment, which stood at 22.8 percent in 1990, was expected to reach 30 percent by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said youth unemployment in the 15-25 year age groups, covering also &quot;the rapidly increasing university students in Africa,&quot; was expected to grow faster than in any other group in the coming 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this period the continents projected population of poor, Diouf said, would rise from 216 million in 1990 to 304 million in the year 2000, accounting for half of Africa's total population.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Comesa, said Monday that the economic development in most of its member states had declined because of the civil wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization's acting secretary-general, Erastus Mwencha, said that the gross domestic production (GDP) of most of its members had declined steadily from 1990 to 1994 due to drought and wars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told a Comesa Council of Ministers meeting in Lusaka that in 1990 the total GDP which was 78.3 billion U.S. dollars declined to 66.1 billion in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that much progress had been made with regards to intra- Comesa trade. In value, this had increased from 834 million dollars in 1985 to 1.7 billion in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that in 1995, GDP grew by an additional 6.1 billion dollars, representing a growth rate of 9.5 percent. Preliminary estimates for 1996 post GDP growth at 1.6 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The Zairean peace talks continued late Sunday with no details being revealed on the content or progress made during the past two days of discussions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discussions attended by representatives of the Zairean government and rebels of the Democratic Alliance for the Liberation of Congo (Zaire) are being chaired by the United Nations and Organization of African Unity representative for the Great Lakes region, Mohamed Sahnoun of Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But nothing is filtering out of the talks. South African Foreign Affairs spokesman Pieter Swanepoel would not confirm whether the discussions would continue today. He also declined to reveal any details about the substance of the negotiations to date.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hosts have consistently avoided providing details on the talks, taking the standpoint that it was up to the negotiating parties to release such information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The negotiations officially opened Saturday at an undisclosed location in Pretoria, where delegations of the Zairean government the anti-government alliance failed to commit themselves to a peaceful settlement to the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the leader of the alliance delegation, Bizima Karaha, commended the Zairean government for agreeing to take part in the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are here because we believe those brothers of ours, for the first time, have realized that they can't make it with mercenaries and genocide. They can only make it with us if they want to survive,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda gave the assurance that his delegation had no pre-conceived ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to start these negotiations with a totally open mind to look for peace and to safeguard the unity, integrity and sovereignty of our country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki -- who has played a leading brokering role in the process leading to the current talks -- expressed confidence that the two parties would rise to the challenge of finding a peaceful solution. &quot;We believe the outcome will make a critical contribution to the common and historical challenge to bring to fruition the African renaissance,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile as the rebels press even closer to Zaire's second largest city, Lubumbashi, reports say that 60 British troops arrived in the Congolese capital, Brazzaville, for a possible evacuation of British nationals from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They joint other soldiers from Belgian, France and United States who have taken similar precautions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 250 U.S. troops on land are backed by another 1,400 marines on board the helicopter carrier, Nassau, crusing off the coast of Congo.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign minister of the SADR announced that James Baker was expected to visit the Western Sahara in the third week of April. In a press statement, Bachir Sayed affirmed that the SADR welcomed this visit, attached high hopes on it to reach a solution to the Sahara issue and deliver the peace process from the crisis which was caused by the intransigence of the Moroccan side.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN Secretary-General Personal Envoy planned to go to the region as soon as he could make arrangements with the parties involved, but he did not specify what countries he would visit. &quot;It seems to me the constellations are such that there should be the potential for some possibilities here,&quot; Baker said. &quot;All I can tell you is I will give it my very best effort.&quot; Mr. Jensen, the Acting Special Representative for Western Sahara, continues doing the day- to-day work as head of the Mission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former Secretary to the President and Cabinet, MacDonald Banda, died March 23 in a car accident. Banda, who was SPC from 1992 to 1994, was the last SPC under the former one party regime and he was replaced when the ruling UDF came to power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time of his death, Banda, a carrier diplomat, was working as Investment Manager with Press Corporation Limited. Thousands of people paid their last respects to him on March 25 at his home in Nathenje, Lilongwe where his remains were buried.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. AIR MALAWI SLASHES REGIONAL FARES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Malawi is offering a 30% discount on all its African regional routes to six cities from April 1 to May 31. The airline's Planning and Marketing Manager, Jasson Siska, said the discount was a marketing strategy aimed at fending off the stiff competition prevailing on domestic and regional routes with more people opting to travel by bus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fairs cut will be applicable on the air line's routes to Harare, Lusaka, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Maputo. Siska said the national flag carrier had also embarked on a phased development programme aimed at improving customer delivery services and the general welfare of the company's staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. POPULATION CENSUS NEXT YEAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A national population census, slated for mid '97, will not take place due to financial hiccups and lack of manpower at the National Statistics Office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner for Statistics, Lloyd Golosi said preparations for the census, which were supposed to have been completed, have just started. A donor who is to sponsor the K30 million (US$2 million) exercise has not yet been identified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lloyd Golosi said, however, there were indications that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) , might co-fund the census with the Malawi government as it did in 1987. &quot;We need 25 vehicles, one for each district, and map assistants also for each district and we are still preparing for the task. At the moment, we only have 12 vehicles,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the 1987 census, the country's population was 8 million. It is estimated that the population has since shot up to 12 million. Malawi has a fertility rate of 3.2%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. CIVIL SERVANTS TO STRIKE APRIL 7</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Service Trade Union has declined a government offer to increase salaries by 10 to 47 percent, giving it one week to reverse the decision, and implement what is known as the Chatsika Report salaries in full or face a nationwide strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a rally in Blantyre, union president, Thomas Banda also announced that civil servants would start a go-slow from April to put pressure on government.  &quot;The go-slow is aimed at making the government come to its senses before destruction,&quot; Banda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government says implementing the Chatsika recommendations in full, estimated at a cost of K1 billion, will badly hurt the economy and set inflation and interest rates spiraling. The government also says the Chatsika wage increases would result in high tax increases and could cause labour instability in the private sector which in turn could discourage investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Office of the President and Cabinet warned in a statement last week that the consequences of implementing the Chatsika salaries now are that both the private sector and the public service would be worse off than before.  Instead, the OPC said, government would adopt a phased approach and award average increases ranging from 47% at lower levels to 10% at higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda however warned the government to implement the 29 cost-saving measures the union presented to government in 1995, which include trimming embassies,ministries and ministerial allowances and tax exemption packages.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police on March 23 shot dead the wife of a Blantyre businessman in a shoot- out allegedly because the car she was driving had been one used in an armed robbery .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African born, Angela, 22, wife of Kwacha Ghambi, met her fate as she was about to open the door of her car near a popular night spot in the heart of Blantyre. She was pronounced dead on arrival at the Adventist Health Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Blantyre police alleged she was killed by stray bullets as they were trying to defend themselves in a scuffle with her husband. According to police, events culminating in the late night shoot-out were sparked off by a highway robbery at gun-point, in which a car belonging to a business magnate was intercepted on the road to the airport by four people in a Mercedes Benz.  The car Mrs. Ghambi was driving was not a Mercedes Benz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four are said to have robbed the driver of the vehicle of some K8,000 (US$660). Police then mounted a hunt for the suspect Mercedes Benz, which they found at the night spot.They shot at the car which was carrying no passengers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The row with Ghambi erupted when police told him they were arresting him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. K20,000,000 WASTED IN PAY FRAUD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance minister Aleke Banda has said there were serious irregularities in civil service wages and salaries which have made government overshoot its budget annual wage bill by K400 million (US$28.25 million). He said the scam was discovered following a probe into what he called &quot;month to month inexplicable fluctuations in funding requirements&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the irregularities ranged from the retention of retired workers on the payroll to payment of people working for private contractors.  Irregularities also included &quot;deliberate fraudulent acts such as payments to employees who had been officially identified as deceased, retired, dismissed or resigned, payments that did not match grades, manipulation of details, absence of employment numbers and the duplication of payment vouchers.The probe revealed that the Ministry of Works was the biggest culprit in the, scam followed by Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The salary irregularities pushed the wage bill from K1.5 billion (US$100 million) to K1.9 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. MUTHARIKA PROBE OVER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A probe into allegations of mismanagement and misappropriation of Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), funds by Secretary General Bingu Wa Mutharika is now over. A report of the findings is to be presented to the ministers' council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commerce and industry minister, Chakakala Chaziya, said Mutharika would be called before the council on April 7 in Lusaka, Zambia. He will be asked to explain what he knows about the allegations which prompted the probe and his being sent on forced leave by the council when it met on January 16-17 in Lusaka. The Council appointed Joel Mwencha, a Kenyan, acting secretary general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutharika has denied the allegations and threatened to take the council to court, saying it did not have the mandate to determine his term of office, conditions of service or send him on forced leave. He also said the council had no powers to institute a probe. Chaziya, however, said the council was fully in its right to act as it did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. DONORS, GOVERNMENT IN TUG-OF-WAR</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors and the Malawi government are engaged in a tug-of-war over a provision in the National Roads Authority Bill (1997), which is scheduled to be debated in the current sitting of parliament. The European Union and the World Bank are not happy with a provision which cabinet inserted into the bill giving the Minister of Works control of the Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of the bill restrains the Board from disbursing any money or authorising payment without the minister's consent. &quot;The Board shall not disburse any money or authorise the payment of any money to any contractor engaged unless the minister has certified in writing that work has been carried out to the required standard,&quot; the provision reads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Head of the European Union in the country, Balduin Zimmer, has since called for the removal of the provision. &quot;We feel that the minister's involvement in the disbursement of funds and authorising of payment is interfering with the independence of the Board,&quot; Zimmer said. This, he said, will also drag out the work because there will be thousands of contractors and it would take longer for the minister to consent to them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Minister of Works and Supplies, Abdul Pillane, said the government will maintain the provision. He said, however, that the bill will be tabled in parliament and if members vote for its removal, government will have to oblige. The National Road Authority Bill (1997), is to establish a board to manage and control the Authority and a fund responsible for generating money.  The Authority's basic aim is to oversee the maintenance, rehabilitation and development of public roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. MCP IN LAST BID FOR PRESS TRUST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Malawi Congress Party has applied for a judicial review of the Press Trust appeal case, arguing that the ruling was based on erroneous interpretation or failure to interpret sections of the Constitution and Parliamentary Standing Orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application comes barely a month after the Malawi Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the Press Trust Reconstruction Act (1996) is valid. The Supreme Court of Appeal on January 31 dismissed a High Court ruling of July 1 1996 that the act was invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hearing of the applications is set for April 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the MCP have filed summons for the review of judgement based on 19 grounds. These claim, among other things, that the Supreme Court judgement ignored the rights of Press Holdings Limited to hold property and not to be arbitrarily deprived of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their application, the lawyers note that having found that former president Kamuzu Banda and incumbent Finance Minister Aleke Banda held shares in trust for MCP, and thereafter for the people of Malawi, the court should have proceeded to find that in 1982 Kamuzu could not have formed a valid trust. This was because the property, which purported to be the Trust Fund, was not his. The lawyers further argue that in this regard the court should therefore have found that the Press Trust Deed of 1982 was null and void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They argue that if the court had established that, the logical conclusion would have been that the Press Trust Reconstruction Act was of no effect, as it purported to transfer assets from trustees of a nonexistent trust, to another set who had nothing to take over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. SECOND HAND CLOTHES KEY TO 1999 ELECTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sale of second hand clothing holds the trump card for any political party to win the 1999 general elections and it could thus be suicidal for government to ban this trade. This view was articulated by the Investment Promotion Manager for Malawi Investment Promotion Agency (MIPA), Nebert Nyirenda during a meeting with private sector and business executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyirenda was addressing concerns raised by representatives from the textile industry. They put down their poor performance as being due to the flooding onto the market of second hand clothing, popularly known as KAUNJIKA, and said it would be very crucial and sensitive to completely ban trade in second hand items when the country is expecting to hold general elections in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sensitivity of the subject becomes even more pronounced in the wake of government's widely proclaimed programme of poverty alleviation, he said. &quot;We are looking forward to other alternatives to solve this problem.&quot; He suggested that one way of ensuring survival in the textile industry was to explore regional and international markets that could absorb Malawi's manufactured goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. OPPOSITION PARTIES RETURN TO PARLIAMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition MCP and Aford, have ended their nine month parliamentary boycott following clergy -mediated talks April 2 between the three parties represented in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties said during the talks which were led by Bishop Felix Mkhori and attended by President Bakili Muluzi, that they had agreed to amend section 65 (1) of the Malawi Constitution which relates to the president's powers on the appointment of cabinet ministers. The meeting mandated whips of the three parties to suggest to the House areas of the section of the constitution that needs to be amended and how this could be done. For his part, Muluzi said he would no longer appoint cabinet ministers from other parties without consulting officials of the parties concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCP and Aford had been boycotting parliament in protest against Muluzi's retention and appointment of cabinet ministers from Aford after the breakup of the two parties' ill-fated coalition. MCP and Aford's return to parliament comes in the wake of several unsuccessful attempts by the church, the Public Affairs Committee and other institutions to bring the three parties to the negotiating table.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Finance Minister, Aleke Banda, has unveiled the 1997/98 budget, promising poverty alleviation and sustainable economic growth with incentives for new investments and export-based industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda announced no increases in PAYE income tax, but revealed new surtax on previously untaxed locally consumed tea, coffee, cooking oil and such services as photocopying, rental of registered conference halls and theatres, office cleaning and maintenance services. Banda said new taxes were necessary to offset those taxes that have been reduced to encourage local industry to grow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said import duty on raw materials used in manufacturing would be removed to create more room for domestic manufacturers to compete against imports from countries where Malawi has bilateral regional agreements. The maximum tariff rate has been reduced from 40 to 35% to reduce the cost of imports. A 10% surtax has been imposed on cooking oil while at the same time input surtax on crude oil has been reduced from 25 to 10%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duty on imported cigarettes has been pushed up from 10 to 35% , while duty on imported beer, vinegar and wine has gone up from 10 to 25%. Banda said this would boost revenue while supporting local industry. Imported fruits will also attract a 10% surtax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also announced a 10% reduction of the surtax on the hotel industry, from the previous 20% which had been criticised by the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The export levy on tobacco, tea and sugar has been reduced from 8 to 4% and the same duty has been applied to exports of coffee, not previously taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To offset revenue losses, which the country faces as a result of the duty and tax incentives, Banda announced an increase in with-holding tax from a general rate of 15 to 20% on rents, royalties, fees and commissions, public entertainment and interest payment by banks. There would be no exemption on with-holding tax except where the recipient is not subject to tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To help promote investment, the government has reduced to zero percent corporate tax on firms manufacturing in Export Processing Zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New investments between US$5 million and US$10 million would be given the option of paying a reduced 15% corporate indefinitely or taking a five year tax holiday, while new investments in excess of US$10 million would be given a similar option but with a tax holiday of 10 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall government expenditure for fiscal 1997/98 amounted to K9,794 million of which 77% is for recurrent expenditure and 23% for development expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Budget allocations for the four priority areas of education, health, agriculture and works have grown from 31% in the 1996/97 budget to 37% in 1997/98.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banda said the deficit including grants (K1,748 million), is projected to increase from 3.8% of the GDP in 1996/97 to 4.3% of GDP in 1997/98 due to an anticipated decrease in foreign grants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - We, Associations and Federations of the Civil Society of Kinshasa, assembled in the Fatima Parish Hall on this Friday, the 28th day of March, 1997, in order to examine the situation which prevails in Zaire:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the expressed will and united efforts of the Zairian People, even to the supreme sacrifice, to bring about a Just State of Zaire;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering that the Power in control, which did not issue from a democratic mandate, intends to maintain itself for a long time to come by means of all sorts of subterfuges, in defiance of the rights of the People to choose their own leaders;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the rebellion in the territory of the Republic of Zaire has in no way offered proof of its engagement in the democratic process initiated by the Sovereign National Conference;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering the allegations of massive violations of the rights and liberties of the Human Person in the areas controlled by the &quot;Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire&quot; (AFDL):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering that the negotiations, such as they are, carried on without the participation of the victims - the People - run the risk of failing to win the support of all;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Considering that if Elections are not quickly organized, another dictatorship may take the place of the first;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with the menace of partition - geographic, political, linguistic, economic - of Zaire, devised by external forces with the complicity of certain sons of the country;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us make known to the Community national as well as international - our position:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let Us beseech the immediate cessation of hostilities throughout the national territory and encourage negotiations capable of creating conditions favorable to the immediate organization of Free Elections, unequivocal and democratic, at once, throughout Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Let us denounce and condemn every ideology that promotes the belief that Power is assumed or preserved at the point of a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Let us denounce and condemn every act or declaration which would limit the breadth of fundamental freedoms gained, or hamper the process of democratization defined by the Sovereign National Conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4 Let us denounce negotiations ongoing or to come, as well as the sharing of powers, between the two armed groups, while excluding their victims - the People;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Let us denounce the setting up of a Committee of Negotiators and the proposal of a National Council, without the effective participation of the Civil Society;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6 Let us denounce and condemn every effort toward partition - geographic, political, linguistic, economic - of Zaire, devised by outside forces and relayed to the Interior by nationalists among the groups of the kind springing up in the east or west;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Let us condemn the psychosis of civil war, the looting, and the partitioning of Zaire consequent on a military presence massive and suspect of exterior influences at the national frontiers, notably in the Republic of Congo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Let us call urgently for the participation of Zairian Organizations for Human Rights in every commission of inquiry, ongoing or to come, concerning massive violations of the rights and liberties of the human person, throughout the whole extent of the national territory; and in the case of the nature of these violations, in the zones under the control of the AFDL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Let us urge the immediate formation of a responsible Government, in order to bring the People quickly to the &quot;Elections Now and Throughout Zaire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Civil Society intends to pursue the struggle for the formation of a democratic order in Zaire, and will constantly make public its proposals for the urgent and effective holding of these elections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - At the outset, back in 1995, Cape Town's Olympic planners had only one table, one telephone and a few chairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their barely furnished office on the 17th floor of the Civic Centre must have seemed as inauspicious a setting as you could find for the origin of the multi-billion rand blueprint that, within a year and a half, would successfully project Cape Town's worldly aspirations, and earn it a place on the shortlist for the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What they did have, aside from an unnervingly compelling calendar of deadlines, was plenty of bright ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The genesis of the Olympic plan always had everything to do with the overarching project of reshaping Cape Town, turning it into a dynamic, fair, vibrant, efficient and growing city, and deliberately altering features of the cityscape born of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The philosophical gist was there, but the mechanics, the detail, were absent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To spend an hour, today, with the planners in their Foreshore eyrie, spectacularly high above the gleaming expanse of Table Bay, it is inconceivable that there might ever have been any significant doubts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there have often been times, moments of frenzy or anguish, when they have had to steel themselves to pause and invoke what team leader Peter de Tolly calls &quot;oriental calm&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also always insisted that &quot;we must ultimately ensure that we have fun here&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are no doubt elements the Deputy City Planner has brought to the project from his considerable experience at home and abroad in planning and urban design.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With degrees in architecture and urban design from the universities of Cape Town and Toronto, he has practised as an architect in Cape Town, and as a consultant urban designer/city planner in Toronto, where, among other things, he played a key role in the Canadian city's waterfront development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Latterly, he was involved in the revitalisation of Cape Town's central city area, and in developing the city's world-class Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has extensive experience in strategic urban growth and change management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His team comprises:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Fellow City of Cape Town secondee Nicola Lloyd is a senior planner with a master's degree in urban and regional planning, whose wide experience on inner and outer metro projects includes work on the redevelopment of District Six, and the building of the acclaimed Hartleyvale hockey venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Mary Jane Morris, an environmental specialist seconded to the Bid Company from Caltex, is a botany and geography graduate of the University of the Witwatersrand, and holds an honours degree in geography and environmental studies. She gained extensive experience in Environmental Impact Assessment during a six-year stint with an international firm of consultants, and is committed to &quot;ensuring sound environmental practice in the bid&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* David Maralack, who holds master's degrees in urban development planning from the University of London and in city and regional planning from the University of Cape Town, has had varied experience as a planning consultant, town planner, researcher and teacher in South Africa and the United States.  He is presently working on his PhD dissertation through the University of Minnesota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Derek Thomas, an architecture graduate from Oxford and a practising architect for 30 years, has spent much of his professional life focusing on what he describes as &quot;socially responsive and cost- efficient architecture&quot;.  He has considerable expertise in mass housing, and is responsible for the Olympic villages in the bid plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Jac Snyman, an architecture graduate of the University of Cape Town, is an urban designer on secondment from the City of Cape Town. He has been involved in the plan for Kalk Bay harbour, and has worked on the Culemborg/Black River project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was when this team sat together in the early days of the bid that a fourth pillar of Olympism - human development - was added to the international movement's long-established triad of principles: sport, culture and environment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what did &quot;human development&quot; mean in a real terms? How would it mesh with the dynamics of Cape Town, and the practical needs of putting on the biggest sporting spectacle in the world?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicola Lloyd recalls some of the first discussions, &quot;when the idea of providing a developmental stimulus emerged, but, as Peter kept stressing, placed in the context of the metropole's future growth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Maralack says it &quot;amounted to posing questions about what Cape Town should be in 20 to 50 years from now, irrespective of the Games, and then asking how the Games could be used to kick-start these things&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the Olympic planning was synchronised with the overarching, long-term progressive city plan, the Metropolitan Spatial Development Framework, its potential as an impressive stimulus, as the key to making things happen, emerged all the more clearly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jac Snyman describes how, once this basis was established, sites were identified against a checklist of factors such as availability of land, sports needs, transport, housing, redressing the apartheid legacy ... but, most importantly, as individual elements of a plan to make human development - socially and economically - a real goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These were &quot;exciting times&quot;, the planners remember, but difficult times too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Winning public support was vital, and tiring. Each of the team spent at least three nights of the week during that period &quot;out in the communities ...  getting bashed&quot;, David Maralack recalls wryly. It was often discomforting, but it paid dividends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also those deadlines. Derek Thomas says that to get the Cabinet's approval - a critical element - &quot;we had to provide budget assessments in as much detail as we could, but invariably we had to resort to generic, conceptualised assessments based on the floor area of facilities and little else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was tough, and we had only a matter of weeks to get it done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, a mammoth and difficult consultation process was launched, with the added complication, Nicola Lloyd recalls, of there being no democratically elected local authorities in the Peninsula. This was before the local elections which brought in the present six councils, and the planners were having to work with no fewer than 39 indecisive and politically weak transitional bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mary-Jane Morris was tasked with launching complex and sensitive environmental assessments, and engaging the Green sector in a project the bid team believed would provide invaluable opportunities for establishing new standards in environmental protection and planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From early 1996, planning activity became frenetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlanta Games loomed in July - and it was important for the bid team to be there to learn lessons - and, a month later, the submission of the minutely detailed, 700-page Bid Book to the IOC in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four months after that - in December - the IOC evaluation commission would touch down to cast a critical eye over all that had been done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overseeing the whole, Peter de Tolly's mind was fixed on maintaining the vision of a dynamic city of the future, catalysed by Olympic planning, a vision of making the bid philosophy a real, achievable goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you look at the civic structure of the city of the past 350 years, there are things which contain the essence of what makes this a great place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it is one of our responsibilities to create a new framework for the next 350 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When it comes down to it, it's the absence of that vision that makes cities the sad places they often are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work of this planning team has been a magnificent opportunity to provide the thrust to make all the difference to this city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it is, he says, &quot;like a cosmic kick in the butt&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - The United States says goods imported into South Africa for shipment to the members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) are susceptible to extensive duty evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its annual appraisal of foreign trade barriers, the Office of the US Trade Representative said Portnet customs officials facilitated the evasion of customs duties by grey-market importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to sources, malfeasance within the South African port system is exacerbated by corruption within the ports of entry of South Africa's Southern African Customs Union partners (Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, and Lesotho), where imported goods are occasionally repackaged as items made in one of these respective countries and exported to South Africa, where they evade customs levies due to the SACU accord,&quot; the report said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1997 National Trade Estimates Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, released at the weekend, said that over the past year several South African importers had complained about illicit imports and import duty evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Importers of agricultural products, poultry, and manufactured goods have asserted that a lack of adequate funding, training and staffing has led to a problem of inefficiency and malfeasance among the port customs inspectors and within the state-owned port and cargo handling company, Portnet,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Finally, illegal shipments overland through Mozambique account for a high share of illegal imports and contraband trade. Importers and foreign customs officials have estimated the percentage of intercepted illegal imports into South Africa at less than 10 percent,&quot; the Office of the US Trade Representative said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It acknowledged that the South African Government was aware of the problems with its customs service and was attempting to redress them through co- operation with international organisations and training programmes with US, British and European customs services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nonetheless, the problem of illegal imports and customs evasion will take many years to overcome, as the Government of South Africa struggles to direct limited funding and inadequate available human resources across a wide area of law enforcement needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US government said several US companies claimed that import surcharges remain in several industries, but the charges cited appeared to be excise taxes that were applied in a non-discriminatory manner to domestic as well as foreign producers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, although the government reduced the tariff on instant-print cameras from 6 percent to zero on June 28 last year, instant-print cameras and instant-print film continued to be classified as luxury items and remain subject to high excise taxes of 37,5 percent and 32,5 percent respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although these excise taxes are non-discriminatory, US producers claim that there are no domestic producers and that the high taxes induce circumvention by illegal importers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Extensive circumvention of customs collection at South African ports of entry may allow some foreign importers to avoid paying the high tax, giving them an advantage over those importers paying proper excise taxes,&quot; the Office of the Trade Representative said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACU, created in 1910, provides for the duty-free status of goods from Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Crime committed by police members has increased dramatically in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now police commissioner Leon Wessels has promised a 'ruthless crackdown'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire fabric of society becomes severely threatened when those who are supposed to be public protectors and preventers of wrongdoing themselves turn to crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are few things more abhorrent to the law abiding than policemen abusing their enormous powers by getting involved in a wide range of heinous offences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a time when people at every level of society are wringing their hands nervously over soaring crime, revelations of offences committed by police will add hugely to their anxiety and to the flight of many talented South Africans to safer countries overseas, to the detriment of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial police commissioner Leon Wessels is absolutely correct in describing the actions and behaviour of police involved in a range of violent and white-collar crimes as &quot;shocking&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi has revealed just how corrupt police have become: more police have been arrested on charges of corruption in the past two years than in the previous 40.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why? What has caused a section of the law enforcers to become as depraved as the law breakers? Are policemen so poorly paid that stealing and taking bribes are not longer a temptation but a perceived necessity? Are they stuck in the same socio-economic abyss that causes ordinary citizens to turn to crime? Have they been so disillusioned by the example set by peers and superiors involved in dirty tricks, torture and murder that the line between right and wrong has become blurred? Are they so demotivated they just don't care?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commissioner Wessels promises a ruthless crackdown on police crime and no mercy for the perpetrators. But if the rot is to be stopped, the root causes must also be identified and removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Acclaimed tenor Yusuf Williams, who was dubbed Cape Town's Black Caruso by arts critics, has paid a nostalgic visit to the Mother City on a foreign passport - 38 years after he and 24 members the Golden City Dixies were stranded in Sweden while touring Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clasping a handful of press clippings to verify his tale and looking 20 years younger than his age of 61, he recalled how autocratic South African consular officials terminated the tour and froze their passports in Stockholm - catapulting the the Dixies overnight from the stage into the international political arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident, in the heyday of apartheid, caused a storm of protest and while mounting political pressures led to the South African government chartering an aircraft to fly them back, it left a permanent scar on Williams and several other stars who opted to remain behind in Sweden. He remained there for 11 years, working in a variety of stage shows, until, in 1970, he teamed up with a German band touring Sweden and migrated to Munich, where he became a German citizen and married Elke. They have a daughter Yasmin, now 11.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefly changing the topic he said: &quot;I used to be a bodybuilder and I've kept young by doing a lot of deep breathing exercises and sticking to the right diet. I walk a lot and still do regular training in the gym and push- ups at home to keep fit. I've maintained a strict diet of three meals a day, starting with a light breakfast of muesli, yoghurt and bananas, following this with salads for lunch and rounding the day off with a decent variable supper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his 27 years in Germany he has demonstrated his versatility as an entertainer. It was there that he switched to his adopted and popular stage alias of Joe Curtis, singing swing, calypso and even Stevie Wonder songs with equal facility. Over the years he honed his act to become one of the most popular singers on the circuit. Williams made his stage d but as an Eoan Group tenor, playing to full houses in the Cape Town City Hall as a principal singer in Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana. At the time he was hailed as one of the greatest operatic discoveries on the continent of Africa and his mentor and tutor, Eoan Group director Joseph Manca, who discovered him while adjucating performers at competitions at the annual Coon Carnival, groomed him for a career as a tenor and a baritone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the opera season was short,&quot; said Williams, &quot;and my environmental and personal circumstances were such that I was forced me to earn a living from singing. So I switched to swing to earn an income from my talents.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lure of the bright lights as a stage and variety show entertainer appealed to him and capitivated his interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says he has no regrets about switching from opera to popular songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main thing is that I was still able to sing a song like Granada once in a while on stage and bring the house down. I kept going and have never had a dull moment in my life, earning my living entirely from stage appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I first switched from opera to swing I soon found I had an aptitude to mimic Mario Lanza, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong and my renditions of songs by such evergreen singing greats had a great appeal for audiences everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When our passports were frozen we learnt that we had another more pressing problem. Everything had not been going as smoothly as it seemed on tour. For instance, we suspected that our mail had, for some unknown reason, been withheld from us and our suspicions were vindicated when we located a pile of our letters in a hotel office and opened them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We then learnt that our families in South Africa had not been paid the money we had earned in terms of an agreed stop-order arrangement made prior to our departure. This, indirectly, led to the breakup of my first marriage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shrugs his broad shoulders: &quot;All that is behind me now. A lot of of troubled waters beneath the bridge as they say. The main thing is I have come back and while the place has changed, the people are still the same and as warm-hearted as ever as I remembered them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of the children of the people who were uprooted from District Six, where the Eoan Group had its base before it was demolished and moved to Athlone under Group Area Act, have spoken to me. Some of the old stalwarts of District Six have also reached out to me via radio programmes in Cape Town.  As a result I have been overwhelmed with heaps of invitations, some of which I cannot honour because I am currently booked for a number in live shows in Germany.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - One of the biggest public participation programmes in the Western Cape has been launched to find a corridor across Grassy Park and the Philippi horticultural area to carry a new freeway, the &quot;missing link&quot;, from Vanguard Drive to Prince George Drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new 4,5-kilometre freeway, an extension of the existing R300, the Cape Flats freeway which at present ends at Vanguard Drive, has the potential to save thousands of kilometres and litres of fuel by giving commuters a more direct route across the Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People living in Mitchell's Plain will have a direct route to their traditional shopping areas of Kenilworth and Wynberg and people from the southern suburbs a shorter route to Cape Town Airport.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time the new freeway will relieve the unacceptable situation of 7 000 vehicles travelling daily through the Philippi horticultural area &quot;rat run&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To make the process of deciding on an acceptable corridor as transparent as possible, an ambitious public participation programme was launched in November last year. More than 170 groups and organisations took part in the talks and workshops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The planning of the freeway is being undertaken by the Cape Flats Consortium which consists of representatives of the Cape Metropolitan Council, the Cape Town City Council, the South Peninsula Council, two firms of consulting engineers, Jeffares and Green and Fongoqa, Skade Toyi and Associates and Sakaza Communications and Public Relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffares and Green director Frank Steele said the study would include details on how the corridor would affect the communities through which it would pass and the environmental and economic impact of the route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although it's still very early in the process, all indications are that the freeway will have tremendous benefits,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was hoped that the planning process would be complete by the end of the year and, if and when the freeway was built, it would more than likely be built in stages because of the high costs involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeffrey Kleinsmith of Sakaza said there were concerns. High on the list was the potential impact the freeway - passing through a highly sensitive area such as the 2 720-ha Philippi horticultural area - would have on the environment, agricultural potential and future development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far the public participation process had resulted in the Cape Flats Consortium having been mandated by a representative group of farmers to present a number of potential road alignments to the landowners, taking into consideration all the concerns expressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, the Grassy Park, Lotus River and Parkwood communities had been consulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their concerns about safety, access, crossings for their children, the impact on housing and business are all being considered in the preliminary design stage,&quot; Mr Kleinsmith said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Pagad has condemned panga-wielding Hard Livings gangsters headed by Rashied Staggie for allegedly attacking about 120 people, including women and children, at a drug awareness meeting in Manenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Hendrik Pistorius said two members of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs were shot in the stomach outside the Manenberg People's Centre hall during ensuing mayhem yesterday and taken to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 10 people in the hall were injured when they were hit with chairs and bricks, kicked and punched.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody appears to have been hurt by the pangas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier the meeting had been guarded by four members of Pagad's &quot;G-force&quot; self-defence unit, but reinforcements arrived later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad's national co-ordinator, Abdus-Salaam Ebrahim, said he was attacked by about five gang members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was injured on the head and in the back when he was hit with a chair and punched after the gangsters told him: &quot;Jy's wit bene&quot; (gangster slang for &quot; you are going to die&quot;).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other people at the meeting, including a 10-year-old boy and several women, were injured when they were kicked and hit with bricks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A masked Pagad supporter said her husband was standing outside the hall before the incident when he overheard one of the gangsters asking the police: &quot;Wat maak julle hier?&quot; (what are you doing here).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that several gangsters then chased her husband but were unable to catch him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A woman who was badly cut during the attack said she had been standing at the entrance when the alleged gangsters walked in, led by Mr Staggie and Ernie &quot;Lapepa&quot; Peters, leaders of the Community Outreach Forum of gangsters who say they have reformed. Mr Staggie is known to be a leader of the Hard Livings gang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said she was punched and hit in her back with a chair after gangsters asked her: &quot;Why didn't you ask us for permission to have this meeting?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the gangsters went for Mr Ebrahim with a panga. Another victim said he was kicked &quot;all the way from the hall to the outside of the centre by gangsters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fearing for their lives, Pagad supporters fled the hall, but outside they were confronted by more than 350 local residents, who shouted abuse and hurled stones at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets of the Cape Flats township, traditionally the headquarters of the Hard Livings gang, erupted in chaos as police escorted a heavily armed convoy of Pagad supporters out of the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the supporters left with faces covered and shotguns drawn, residents and gangsters shouted abuse and pelted their vehicles with stones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police fired several shots when they came under attack by the mob, who screamed: &quot;Why are you protecting these bastards?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Police and troops moved into the Cape Flats today to head off more violence after a man was killed and five people were injured in attacks on the homes of alleged drug dealers early today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attacks follow an attack in Manenberg yesterday on supporters of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs by the Hard Livings gang, who invaded a drug awareness meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two people were wounded by gunfire at the meeting and a number of others injured when they were attacked by gangsters allegedly led by Community Outreach Forum leader Rashied Staggie.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five Pagad members were arrested after the clash at the Manenberg People's Centre and four other Pagad supporters were arrested there later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Superintendent Hendrik Pistorius said the homes of three alleged drug dealers were shot at in Mitchell's Plain and Steenberg early today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the attacks, Jerome Williams of 130 Flora Street in Steenberg died when he was wounded in the chest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other attacks had taken place in Heideveld and Athlone, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those injured in the attacks today were 10-year-old Monique Philander and Ismaile English, 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial police spokesman John Sterrenberg said patrols had been increased on the Cape Flats around flashpoints from Manenberg to Retreat and Steenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our members have been bolstered by Defence Force troops while we are busy re-evaluating our strategy today to address the current situation,&quot; he said.  This would involve talking to the groups involved in a bid to end the bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four of the victims yesterday were neighbourhood watch members who tried to intervene during the clashes,&quot; said Superintendent Sterrenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After this weekend's attacks we have arrested nine people and confiscated three heavy-calibre handguns.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday afternoon five Pagad members were arrested after a tense confrontation between gangsters and the anti-drug group in Manenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five, Moegamat Sieed, Moegamat Saban, Ismaile Sieed, Adenaan Daniels and Ali Williams, appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court on charges of public violence. They were not asked to plead and were released on R600 bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Pistorius said he did not know why only Pagad members had been arrested in Manenberg, as it was alleged that gangsters were responsible for the confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad supporters who met in the Gatesville mosque after they were escorted out of Manenberg by a strong police contingent said they were unhappy with the way police handled the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A masked Pagad man said the police had not protected defenceless woman and children from gangsters inside the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad national co-ordinator Abdus-Salaam Ebrahim, who was also injured in the attack at the centre, said that the gangsters were &quot;crazy&quot; if they thought they could scare the anti-drug movement by attacking woman and children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed for calm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Given that majority in a community may not see health, as medically understood, as a priority, planners and workers in this field should therefore not assume that people are ready and waiting to participate in community based health care activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community must determine their own needs, priorities and capabilities, and any projects should capitalize on those priorities and capabilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the most famous guiding principles in most Community serving and based organizations and indeed it did crop as a binding force to the participants of the first Community Based Health Care, (CBHC) conference held in Nairobi from March 17 to 21, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately, it has been plain to see that this principle has been closer to theory than practice because participation, which is community involvement, seems o be induced and driven by donors and intermediaries such that there is undirected accountability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undirected accountability, because leaders and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) are usually not accountable to the communities they are intended to serve, and what is more, the normal traditional functions are professionalised thus giving even greater foundation to a rigid vertical process - the top-down approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Omondi, a Kenyan Community resource person says he is disillusioned with the way his services are overlooked by leaders and NGOs. He adds that it is especially difficult to create a partnership when NGO executives &quot;drive pajeros at the expense of the communities they are supposed to help.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior programme manager of Action Aid-Kenya, Shahanah Ahmed observes that community problems can be anticipated only if leaders and NGOs &quot;listen to the people&quot; and emphasize qualitative research methods to understand the causes and possible solutions to the problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emphasizing health information systems, Ahmed feels that computerization in community based organizations (CBOs) are a bit out of place considering that a feed back of research findings to the communities is important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Action Aid manager notes that since information should be used to break poverty cycles, there is need to encourage manual analysis in rural and peri- urban areas and that the information released should &quot;satisfy as well as dissatisfy the stake-holders so that change occurs. Stake-holders in this case are the community members, CBOs and the donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first CBHC conference dwelt mainly on ways of making health a reality for all beyond the year 2000. About 400 participants drawn from Africa and the rest of the world convened at a Nairobi hotel to design an accord, the Nairobi Accord, that will ensure Health For All (HFA) beyond 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, one wonders whether the accord would help nurse the grudge community health workers have against community based organizations and health systems as most of them are volunteer workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cross-section of community resource persons interviewed by APS did not seem pleased about working for charity. Most of them made reference to their dire poverty and the amount of time and dedication they had put into community health work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Ogola, a community health worker in Western Kenya expressed satisfaction in her voluntary health work, adding that she had learnt a great deal through conferences and seminars such as the CBHC conference. She, however, called for more incentive so that she can perform better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Okello, another community health worker in Kenya's western district of Siaya, felt that the key to good health in African communities is food security. Relating to his own district, Okello told this writer, people never saw the importance of food security and the nutritional value of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed for more awareness building on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also expressed disappointment at the poor involvement of the communities in health programmes, saying that the people know themselves better and therefore can define their most pressing needs. Okello observed that when all is said and done, CBOs and governments should work towards poverty alleviation, adding that people will respond better in good economic conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grace Mundeta, a Zimbabwean health worker said volunteer health workers ought to be remunerated as a matter of incentive, encouragement and appreciation. Mundeta revealed that in her country volunteer health workers often lied that they were receiving salaries to save themselves from public ridicule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With only three years to 2000, health deteriorating at a frightening rate, encroaching poverty and expanding slums, it is still uncertain that there will be light at the end of the tunnel even beyond the next millennium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving a community the onus to decide its needs, priorities and capabilities can be frustrating because most Africans are more concerned with ensuring day-to-day necessities like food and water, according to Director General, African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF)-Kenya, Michael Gerber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerber actually describes this situation as &quot;community imperialism&quot; that has caused &quot;sustainable development fog&quot; because, he says, it is apparent that socio-economic factors influence people's decisions regarding how they will live and where they will situate their dwellings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alluding to an education system where a teacher had to ask pupils what they felt like doing, which is most unlikely, Gerber feels that while it is important to first determine local priorities and disease causation, the majority of a community may not see health, as medically understood, as a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gerber points out that in his analysis, CBOs and health workers should not assume that people are ready and waiting to participate in community based health care activities. The problem really is that most community leaders are merely &quot;watchmen&quot; protecting their positions and wealth, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Director of the country support team for East and Central Africa, Dr. Miriam Were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Were maintains that communities should assess their priorities and be their own leaders with &quot;developing concerned persons&quot; facilitated by government and NGOs to deal with community problems in a mutually respectful context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the role of traditional healers, Dr. Were observed that numerous studies indicate that people often go past hospitals to a traditional healer because it is there that they will find a &quot;personal touch&quot; -&quot;people are tired of machine-based approaches that may keep you alive without giving life to your years,&quot; she adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expressing the advantage traditional healers have over the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">health systems, Dr. Were says managers of health care approaches have been too ignorant to plan health care services that are socially and psychologically relevant, acceptable and usable by people for whom they are planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acknowledging that over 70 per cent of Africa's population</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">live in rural communities and villages, Dr. Were feels that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">since a sick person may not get the personal touch throughout</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the health system, the community level should provide it by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dealing with people one knows and only a few at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A top-down approach on communities certainly will not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">work! Rather, a community based strategy must be employed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recognizing that individuals are already making decisions for</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">themselves regarding CBHC and only programmes consistent with</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">their interests will ultimately be sustainable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - With recurrent drought in various parts of Africa, farmers are increasingly concerned about the gradual disappearance of traditional food crops and are trying to set up new mechanisms to conserve and utilize the varieties in their farms and communities. Our APS Correspondent explores some of the issues affecting agricultural biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a long time in the drought-prone district of Chivi in Zimbabwe, farmers agonized as they sought suitable seeds for the type of land and climate in their district. Government extensionists promoted high-response varieties of maize which were often unsuitable as they required optimal growing conditions.  Small grains like sorghum and millet were ignored despite being more suited to the irregular rainfall and poor soil-types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gradually, the farmers established local seed fairs which with time have become very popular. At the fairs, farmers not only exchange seeds but also share knowledge on farming practices that are relevant to the area.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one of the fairs, up to 50 varieties of sorghum, millet, beans and bambara nuts were exhibited and exchanged. Further, farmers identified more varieties that were no longer found locally but which they believed were available in neighbouring districts, prompting a wider search for and exchange of seeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tharaka Nithi, Eastern Kenya, a similar seed fair was held last year, with 119 farmers displaying 141 locally grown varieties of 12 crops. Another one held last month came at a time when most posts of the Eastern region were hit by severe droughts. Fairs have become an important way of conserving biodiversity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why all the fuss about conservation of seeds? The history of food production goes back between 10,000 to 15,000 years, according to Dynamic Diversity, a booklet by the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG), which is working to help reverse the decline in crop diversity. Quoting Fowler, C. and Mooney, P.R. in their book, The Threatened Gene: Food, Politics and the Loss of Genetic Diversity (1992), the publication states that 'systematic production of food began through the innovation of hundreds of thousands of people in many different social and ecological circumstances.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From many thousands of species of edible plants around the world, farmers and food providers developed and nurtured several hundred species from which they created millions of varieties of useful plants. Consequently, the domestication of the world's major food crops is regarded by many to have been the catalyst for the greatest transformation in human civilization - the advent of settled agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another book, Regenerating Agriculture: Policies and Practice for Sustainability and Self-Reliance (1995), Pretty J.N. adds that the type of agriculture which was developed was diverse, location specific and complex. &quot; This agriculture is now mainly found in less fertile areas such as uplands, savannas, swamps, near-deserts and forests, predominantly in the South.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is significant, however, as it provides food for nearly 35 per cent of the world's population and is dependent on farmers' crop varieties which are well adapted to the growing conditions in these areas. In this type of agriculture, farmers integrate resources from the farm and the wild, diversifying their livelihood base in addition to planting crops. This enables them to survive fragile and challenging environments and ensure a year-round balanced diet as well as augment their income. Maintaining diversity is, therefore critical to ensuring food security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biodiversity of food species, sometimes referred to as agricultural biodiversity or the genetic resources for food and agriculture, is an important subset of general biodiversity. In addition, it is the basis of food security. Biodiversity makes it possible to produce food of desired qualities and taste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) play a significant role in developing global systems that affect the biodiversity of food species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAO is the principal inter-governmental institution concerned with agricultural biodiversity. It achieved the agreement of 148 countries in June 1996 to a global Plan of Action for the conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (GPA), which contains activities on in situ conservation, among others. This is to be taken forward at subsequent negotiations in the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources of Food and Agriculture (CGRFA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This commission is extending its brief from covering only plant genetic resources to include domestic animal diversity (from which FAO already has an international programme), fish genetic resources and forest genetic resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is also the forum in which the International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources (IU), which includes a commitment to farmers' rights, will be negotiated. FAO is also a key proponent of sustainable agriculture and rural development through various of its programmes and is implementing a code of conduct for responsible fisheries, among other relevant programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was negotiated in Rio De Janeiro at the Earth Summit in 1992. The CBD's controlling body, the Conference of the Parties to the Biodiversity Convention (COPS), meets annually and reviews progress in the development and implementation of the Convention. One aspect of this mandate is to consider agriculture biodiversity. It receives reports from FAO on current negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is hoped that the revised IU from FAO, including Farmers' Rights, will be included as protocol to the Convention. However, there are fears that the increasing influence of the World Bank, the Group of 7 and the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the conventions would mean that farmers will get little recognition for their contribution to biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, the United Nations General Assembly is reviewing progress of the Earth's Summit's Action Plan (Agenda 21), in 1997, five years after Rio, a fact which may affect how agricultural biodiversity is governed in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second key institution is the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR). Its overall purpose is to promote international research on sustainable improvements in the productivity of agriculture, forestry and fisheries in countries in the south, in ways that enhance nutrition and well-being, especially of low-income groups of people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CGIAR comprises 16 International Agricultural centres and has a system-wide Genetic Resources Programme managed by one of the centres, the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute. The CGIAR, collection, which is now held in trust by FAO. The CGIAR is the major influence on agricultural research internationally but urgently needs to develop their programmes in ways that are more responsive to the majority of poor farmers, herders and fisherfolk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, World Trade Organization (WTO) incorporates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which since the Uruguay Round Table of negotiations, now trade liberalization and the removal of subsidies and protection from local food production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of its mandate is to promote a Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights system (TRIPs) which favours the development of patents, or other effective systems of intellectual property protection, for living organisms of which a review is due in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been so far three major conservation approaches: in situ, ex situ conservation and conservation in genetic 'reserves'. In situ conservation is achieved through maintaining and developing biodiversity in farmers' fields and gardens, on rangelands and in coastal gardens. The genetic resources develop through utilization and selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, ex situ conservation is mainly done in genebanks or in living collections away from production systems that developed the resources.  This type of conservation has received a lot of attention in recent years.  However, this approach can only preserve materials taken from farms and the local environment, it cannot develop diversity. It may be of interest to explore this conservation concept within communities to support local production systems, according to the authors of Dynamic Diversity. The third option is the formation of genetic reserves, usually in remote environments, which discourage communities from developing their crop varieties and animal breeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, to achieve improved conservation of agricultural biodiversity, policies and programmes need to among other measures. promote the conservation, development and legal use of a wide range of biodiversity of food species in ways which encourage the local improvements of genetic resources; increase consumption of locally produced food and generate among consumers awareness of the importance of maintaining agricultural biodiversity; Emphasize in situ conservation and utilization, maintaining dynamic diversity rather than freezing and losing diversity in genebanks (ex situ genebanks should only be used as a backup to the living, dynamic and evolving collections used and nurtured by food providers) and increase recognition and rewards to women who have been the principal nurturers and developers of the biodiversity of food species.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Barely a week before Zairean rebels and government were certain to meet face-to-face in South Africa to try and negotiate a peace settlement of the Zairean crisis, the country's Roman Catholic archbishop has appealed for an end to the bloody conflict that has left the lives of ordinary persons in complete disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Distressed by the suffering endured particularly by ordinary people caught up in the current strife in Zaire, the Catholic Archbishop of Kinshasa, Frederic Cardinal Etsohou has appealed to the government forces and rebels to end the fighting in the eastern part of this Central African nation and help facilitate talks due in Pretoria,South Africa on April 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an Easter Day meeting with journalists in the Zairean capital on March 30, the Cardinal said his greatest wish was for an end to the war because people were suffering so much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I call on the people of Zaire, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda ... everyone to stop the war, and also for Western nations to stop selling us arms. We don't need weapons, we need implements to work the land and to develop African countries,&quot; Cardinal Etsohou said in Kinshasa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His appeal came against a background of reports that rebels, led by Laurent- Desire Kabila, currently controlling much of eastern Zaire are grabbing more territory in southern Zaire's mineral-rich Shaba region ahead of peace talks that began in South Africa over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to rebel and independent reports, the guerrillas have seized Kasenga, a town near the border with Zambia, 216 kilometres north-east of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels, who now control a quarter of the vast country, said they captured the town with little resistance from government forces, claims that were confirmed by humanitarian workers in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasenga gave them an &quot;open door&quot; to Lubumbashi, the province's capital, and they were advancing beyond the town, the rebels said, although the chief of staff of the Zairean military, General Mahele Lyeko, insisted on March 29 that Kasenga was still under government control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Defence Ministry early last week reported heavy fighting around the town of Moba, on Lake Tanganyika, 150 kilometres south of Kalemia, in Shaba province, and later said it had retaken the town from the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall of Kasenga would mark a significant advance by the rebels, led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, at a time when rebel representatives and Kinshasa authorities are meeting for negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That meeting was agreed to at a special Organization of African Unity (OAU) meeting in Lome, Togo, on March 26, the first face-to- face meeting between the warring parties since the rebels took up arms last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The archbishop's call also came after Mobutu's camp received a major jolt when a long-time supporter of the strongman threw his sympathy to rebel forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in Kinshasa, former prime minister Jean Nguza Karl-I-Bond urged his followers to &quot;no longer obey the regime&quot; of the dictatorial president who has run Zaire for 31 years. He said that he was quitting as leader of the Conclave Political Forces, a coalition of political parties that have been close to Mobutu, and charged that Mobutu was maintaining &quot;political confusion&quot; over Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weakened by cancer, Mobutu, 66, has rarely been seen in public since he returned to Kinshasa on March 21 from France to deal with the rebel offensive that has cost him the eastern quarter of Africa's third largest country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karl-I-Bond, who hails from Shaba, urged his supporters to &quot;welcome the rebel chief&quot; to Lubumbashi, the provincial capital, where inhabitants have been awaiting Kabila's arrival for days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was withdrawing support for Mobutu after he reappointed Kyungu Qu Mwanza as governor of Shaba province. Mwanza had the same job until 1991, when he was ousted after friction between Shaba and East Kasai natives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will say to my activists that this governor is Mobutu's governor,&quot; he said. &quot;They are now free to do what they wish and side with Kabila. They can welcome him, because my party has become an independent force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new developments also come as the Kinshasa government remained in a political paralysis, unable to name a new prime minister since the resignation of the cabinet shortly after Mobutu returned to the country from abroad on March 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile opposition groups meeting at the parliament in Kinshasa on April 2 named Etienne Tshisekedi as Zaire's Prime Minister, a proposal that was okayed by President Mobutu Sese Seko's signature, but little else was heard by way of official comments. Tshisekedi, a minister many times before breaking with Mobutu in the 1980s, replaces Kengo wa Dondo who resigned on March 24. The transition period gives the opposition power to propose the new prime minister to the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a warning to Zaire's opposition leaders before they announced their choice of premier, the rebels' Voice of the People radio said on March 29 that &quot;any adventurer&quot; who agreed to be Mobutu's prime minister would pay dearly. It called on the main opposition leader, Etienne Tshisekedi, not to accept the &quot;poisoned chalice&quot; of the premiership after previous premier Kengo wa Dondo was forced to resign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels' &quot;justice minister&quot;, Kongolo Mwenze, said last week that if Tshisekedi became premier, he would become &quot;an enemy&quot; who would have to be beaten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from Kabila, Tshisekedi is the only figure powerful enough to run against Mobutu, observers say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu, now one of African's perennial figures, seized power in 1965, after independence had been followed by civil war. The then army commander abolished political parties and finally established a single party, the Popular Movement for the Revolution (MPR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His one-party rule was bolstered by prosperity from the rise in the prices of copper, one of the many valuable minerals abundant in this Central African state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1975, however, copper prices collapsed, helping lead to massive foreign debt in Zaire that had a major impact on both domestic and foreign policy.  The situation also suffered from the government's corruption and doctrinaire nationalistic effort to &quot;Zaireanize&quot; the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1990, Mobutu yielded to international pressure and announced a transition to a multiparty system. But this is precisely the system that has failed to create the accountability and debate that would lead to reforms, spawning instead a rebellion that people here seem to be favouring as much out of weariness as political conviction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All hopes are now pinned on the face-to-face talks, the first between the two sides since the rebels launched their offensive six months ago, for the Mobutu regime to save face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But rebels are not expected to walk easily to the conference table, their intransigence clearly built on their military successes. In the past six months, they have seized a quarter of Zaire, in the east and south-east where the mineral wealth of the central African state is concentrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These resources, the bedrock of Zaire's economy, range from copper, the leading mineral, to cobalt, industrial diamonds, zinc, tin, manganese, gold and cadmium. And the resources are of prime importance to the global economy as 60 per cent of the world's cobalt, 90 per cent of the world's small industrial diamonds and a significant proportion of the world's copper come from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seemingly relentless rebel offensive has also trapped an estimated 100, 000 Rwandan Hutu refugees, causing an ongoing row between the United Nations refugee agency and the rebel leadership over how best to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNHCR official Filippo Grandi said the rebels were insisting that refugees camped near Kisangani move south towards the river port town of Ubundu. &quot;We prefer to assist them on the spot as we cannot make them walk in their present state,&quot; Grandi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Around 100,000 exhausted, sick and desperate refugees have set up makeshift camps between seven and 40 kilometres south of Kisangani after leaving the river port of Ubundu around 10 days ago. The World Food Programme (WFP) managed to reach them with 120 tonnes of food aid by train on March 27 and 28, their first supplies for a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels are refusing to allow them to cross the recently taken city of Kisangani on their way home to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grandi said the UN agency had agreed to ask the refugees to move a few kilometres back from a rebel military position. &quot;But we can't force them to,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN wants to evacuate the most vulnerable refugees back to Rwanda using Kisangani airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With five planes, we can take between 1,000 and 1,500 vulnerable people every day,&quot; Grandi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The others face a gruelling journey, he added. &quot;We will transport them by truck through Kisangani, but without stopping until we reach 60 kilometres, on the road to Lubutu.&quot; There, the refugees will have to dismount and hike for a further 40 kilometres as the road is impassable, Grandi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further truck journeys, with periods of arduous long walks where the road is again impassable, await the refugees before their distant goal of Bukavu, on Rwanda's border with Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency believes that it can repatriate 1,000 refugees a day with this plan. &quot;Therefore, it could take, at best, between two and three months. But this plan has first to be approved by the (rebel) Alliance,&quot; Grandi cautioned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACHIMOTA-GHANA - Christian communicators in Africa have been urged to emulate the prophets of old and wage a relentless war against ethnic and religious conflicts, plight of refugees and injustices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Kofi Totobi Quakyi, Ghana's Minister of Information made this call here when opening a three-day seminar under the theme Towards Promoting Human Dignity in Africa - A challenge to the Church and Christian Media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The March seminar, attended by 30 participants from eight African countries was sponsored by the World Association for Christian Communication in Africa (WACC-AR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quakyi told participants drawn from Ghana, Togo, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Kenya, South Africa and the Gambia that there were many social vices on the continent which dehumanize man, adding that &quot;God created all of us in His image and we must not destroy, dehumanize and degrade the image which is molded in beauty and love.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ghanaian Information Minister also cited the abuse of the environment as another act of human indignity and urged communicators to educate the people on the need to preserve forests and trees from total destruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister lamented diseases that are killing Africans. He also deplored the influx of young men and women to the cities in search of employment, and their gradual lure to drug-related crimes, robbery and prostitution among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Girls between the ages of 14 and 16 give birth and are abandoned in various places. The result is that these children are also abandoned in various places. Why should this happen? You as Christian communicators have a daunting task to stop indignity against man. When you see things happen rise and save the lives of the people as the Lord told Prophet Habakkuk - 'Write down clearly on clay tablets what I reveal to you so that it can be read at a glance,&quot; the Information Minister challenged journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quakyi said promoting human dignity is not an easy task and therefore urged communicators to show love, decency and affection for their fellow beings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He regretted that many of the tribal conflicts in Africa were fanned by journalists, charging that had they taken the trouble to soberly reflect on the events and suggested a constructive approach instead of destructive, negative methods, most lives would have been saved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You all know that information is power but power is used to promote peace, love, unity and understanding. Any communicator who uses his penmanship to foment trouble or divide the people is not promoting human dignity and therefore is the son of perdition,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further challenged Christian communicators to be real apostles of communication by delivering the exact message without adulterating it. &quot; Remember what the Lord told Moses when he asked him to go to Egypt and ask King Pharaoh to unchain the Israelites from bondage. 'Let my people go.' This was the concise and precise message from God. Moses did not change it. He delivered it with courage and fortitude. I charge you to be good communicators and not bad ones.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Quakyi reminded the participants that bad communicators are those who never tell the truth for fear of being arrested or persecuted. Indeed bad communicators are those who cause havoc and instability, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Underscoring the role of obedience in communication, the Ghanaian minister urged journalists to be dedicated, committed, fearless and truthful. &quot;Finally, take note that a man's dignity is his greatest pride but when that dignity is dented or smudged, he ceases to be a whole man,&quot; he challenged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar chairman Rev. David Dartey, who is the General Secretary of the Christian Council of Ghana said events in Africa were gloomy and urged the churches to provide material and spiritual needs for the people. &quot;You must endeavour always to show concern to the poor, the marginalised, the sick, and the hungry by ensuring that life is made meaningful to them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar deliberated on the dehumanising tendencies in Africa with particular reference to Ghana and the West-African sub-region, factors responsible for the erosion of human dignity in Africa and the state of the media in Africa with particular reference to issues on human dignity in Ghana and the sub-region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BANGUI - Mutinous soldiers from the Central African Republic have held a series of talks with African peacekeepers to restore relations after violence the previous weekend which left some 20 people dead, the peacekeepers' chief said on March 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Edouard Nkili, head of the African peace force, said he had held several rounds of talks with the mutineers after the previous weekend's clashes between rebels and troops from Chad who comprise part of the peacekeeping mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkili said the peacekeepers &quot;have not come to the Central African Republic to make war,&quot; and stressed that his men were trying to persuade the rebels to disarm, but that no weapons had yet been handed over despite the March 30 deadline.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the rebels said they &quot;were not taking any notice of the timetable (for peace),&quot; and that they &quot;did not know what disarmament they were talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 450 peacekeepers, with equipment from France, were deployed in February to oversee agreements that ended the last two-months' mutiny after an intra-African diplomatic effort to end the crisis, which had begun over salaries, but ended up in a bid to oust President Ange-Felix Patasse after the mutineers had accused Chadian soldiers of supporting his regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last February, following a January accord, opposition parties were called to join a coalition government, and parliament voted in favour of an amnesty for anyone liable to prosecution over the last mutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the hostilities broke out again the previous weekend in and around the Bangui district of Petevo, one of the strongholds of the 500 soldiers who rebelled last November to demand the ouster of President Patasse, despite efforts to restore harmony to a country wracked by three separate army mutinies last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bangui's streets were deserted on March 23 because of the escalating violence, and other members of the 700-strong MISAB contingent were out in force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses reported that some Chadian shopkeepers had been taken hostage by the former mutineers, after the ex-mutineers claimed that their Kasai barracks had been targeted by three mortars, fired either by the MISAB force or the presidential guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both sides have accused each other of provocation. But local sources said the ex-mutineers were attempting to advance on an old armaments factory in the northwest of the city which serves as headquarters for the peacekeeping force's 150-strong contingent from Chad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those killed included two who had opened fire on the six-nation MISAB forces and five civilians hit by stray gunfire, the sources said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEL-AVIV - Adisn Masala, the first Ethiopian Jew elected to the Knesset (Parliament) in Israel says it is not justifiable to call the general Israel population racist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot say the general Israeli population are racist; true some individuals are very racist and call black Ethiopian Jews nick names, but the majority of the population are certainly not racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sentiments come in the wake of revelations of racism in Israeli army ranks which have resulted in nearly 20 suicides among Ethiopian Jews serving in Israel's conscript army in the last three years alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Israeli soldier of Ethiopian Jewish extraction named Elan Tamana is the latest suicide case to hit the army. Israel's Ethiopian community blame racism in the army, a charge borne out by Tamana's sister who said her brother regularly complained to her that his platoon comrades regularly called him &quot;niger&quot; or the Israeli word &quot;kushi&quot;. They chided him to bring his own cup from home and not use their cups and plates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu angrily branded racism in the Israeli army as &quot;an aberration,&quot; following a visit by another Ethiopian Israeli soldier who complained that he was denied medical treatment at a military hospital because he was black.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early last year, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressed his bitterness, saying he too would feel aggrieved following reports in an Israeli daily that blood donated by Israeli's Ethiopian community was regularly destroyed by the Israeli Blood Bank service, who attributed the practice to fears that such blood donated by the black community was more likely to carry infectious agents like HIV or Hepatitis-B.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Peres said he understood the anger of the black Jewish community after several thousands of them went on the rampage in Tel Aviv to protest what they said were wide-spread racial segregation against their community, most of whom arrived in Israeli in a mass airlift in the late 80s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are some 62,000 Jews of Ethiopian extraction in Israel. Most are poor and have made little headway socially since they arrived in Israel.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ALGIERS - One of Algeria's main opposition parties, the Socialist Forces Front (FFS), has decided to take part in the June 5 general elections, but Muslim extremists have said they will boycott the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FFS first secretary Seddik Debaili said after a meeting of his party's leadership on April 12 that the party will campaign on the theme of peace for Algeria, and reserved the right to pull out of the poll if democratic principles were not respected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The elections had been imposed by the regime of President Liamine Zeroual and were not the solution to the country's civil war, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FFS's decision means that most of the legal political parties will run in the general elections, unlike the presidential elections in November 1995 and the referendum a year later, which extended Zeroual's constitutional powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The June 5 poll will give Algeria its first elected assembly since the annulment of the first round of elections in January 1992, which the now- banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. That move sparked off the conflict which has killed an estimated 60,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on April 1, the outlawed FIS reiterated that it will not field any candidates in the June 5 general elections. &quot;FIS representatives have absolutely no intention to stand in these elections -- and with no other parties whether they share our ideology of not,&quot; one of FIS leaders told the daily Al-Alem-Siyassi, which did not reveal his identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This statement refutes persistent reports in the Algerian press recently which suggested that FIS candidates might stand on the electoral lists of other parties, particularly those which, like the FIS, signed an &quot;appeal for peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This declaration is nothing more than a political manoeuvre destined to win greater popularity and credibility or Ennahda by attracting the FIS's large following with something non-existent,&quot; the anonymous FIS leader was cited as saying in reply to Ennahda leader, who recently said his party was prepared to include FIS candidates on its lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FIS decision came one month after reports reaching here that its executive bureau in exile had undergone a reshuffle that had left at the top its Germany-based leader, Rabah Kebir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique issued in Bonn spoke of &quot;a structural readjustment&quot; within the leadership which had created a seven-man executive committee - all newcomers with the exception of Kebir, whose deputy would be Abdelkrim Ghemati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said it was &quot;open to all the cadres and active members of the FIS as long as they respect its political line and its legitimate&quot; leadership in the persons of Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, both imprisoned in Algeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcomers to the leadership in exile, include Djaafar el-Houari, the former president of the Algerian Brotherhood in France (FAF) who fled to London after being expelled in 1994 to Burkina-Faso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another is Abdelkrim ould-Adda, who with Anwar Haddam represented the FIS at the signature of a &quot;national pact&quot; with the Algerian opposition in January 1995 in Rome.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BAMENDA-CAMEROON - Parliamentary elections in the West African nation of Cameroon will take place on May 17, President Paul Biya has announced here.  Elections were last held in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement coincides with reports of serious civil disturbances in the north western district of Bamenda which is predominantly English speaking.  Anglo Cameroonians regularly complain that Francophone regions monopolize power and state resources at their expense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government says 10 people including gendarmes were killed in the civil disturbances in Bamenda at the end of March. The opposition in Cameroon says the troubles were fomented by the government of President Pauyl Biya as a pretext for postponing elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier the Cameroon Minister for Information Augustin Konchu Kumenyi said investigations were still being carried out to determine if the disturbances in Bamenda originated from the aspirations of English speaking separatists.  He said the government had sent more troops to Bamenda to ensure that peace prevailed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other reliable sources say the disturbances in Bamenda were the work of a group called the Southern Cameroon National Liberation Army (SCNLA), whose mainly youthful conscripts were now being rounded up by the army. Reports from the region say there are as many as 500 members of the rebel outfit still at large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1961, Southern Cameroon sometimes called Western Cameroon formerly under British rule (anglophone Cameroon) decided in a United Nations sponsored plebiscite to quit the Federation of Nigeria and instead join the francophone Republic of Cameroon in a federation of equal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the disputed elections of 1992 it became clear that the incumbent President Paul Biya could face greater challenges from anglophone Cameroon following the post-election declaration that the former Southern Cameroon was a mere captive nation within the 36- year-old union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed in April 1993, over 4,000 delegates from all the 13 divisions of anglophone Cameroon met at the All Anglophone Conference held at the Buea Catholic Mission at which speaker after prominent speaker declared in essence that &quot;we (anglophone) have been treated like the jetsam and flotsam of life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE - As Zimbabwe prepares to host the 10th Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in June this year, bullish animal rights groups in the West are on the offensive against the country's attempts to lobby for resumption in ivory trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, who claim to be saviours of wildlife, are even attempting to convince about 1,500 delegates from 136 countries to move the conference from Zimbabwe to another country which supports the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have even extended their pressure to influence donors and Western governments to cut aid to countries defying their dictates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, local wildlife experts accuse the groups of putting animals before human beings by imposing strict protectionist measures at the expense of the welfare of the people and the ecosystems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of concern to Zimbabwe is the 1989 ban on international trade in ivory which has also affected Botswana and Namibia with equally huge populations of elephants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban was initiated in the hope of controlling poaching which has been responsible for the sharp decline in animal numbers particularly in East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three Southern African countries have in the past unsuccessfully lobbied for the down-listing of the elephant from Appendix I which bans any trade to Appendix II which allows for regulated trade under strict conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lifting of the ban during the conference would enable Zimbabwe to resume trade of its stockpile of 40 tonnes of ivory, which would fetch millions of dollars that could benefit the cash-strapped National Parks Department and help fund other government social welfare programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the most vocal opponents of Zimbabwe's lobby is Species Survival Network, a consortium of over 30 non-governmental organizations and leading animal groups active internationally, whose principal function will be to ensure that the 1989 bans stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This they will seek to achieve not by calm reasoning but by whipping up public anger to such a fever pitch that would-be traders will need skins like bull elephant hide if they remain stout in their resolve,&quot; Africa Resource Trust, a locally-based Southern Africa conservation trust warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But local conservationists and government argue that elephants in most of Southern Africa are not an endangered species and are in fact a danger to the environment and human life because of their large and increasing number which is now out of control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) director Taparendava Maveneke says although elephants in Africa are not healthy in numbers, Southern African countries' elephants populations are increasing to the extent of threatening the survival of other wild species and the whole ecosystem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 65,000, Zimbabwe carries twice the number of elephants it can handle at its optimum level of 35,000. Because of their large numbers, the animals have become a menace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People are being trampled to death or left maimed for life. Crops and the natural vegetation is destroyed while homes are damaged. As a result people live in constant fear of the animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maveneke says the groups who practice &quot;environmental colonialism&quot; still regard the concept of a Dark Africa where western &quot;romanticists&quot; disguised as tourists visit to have a taste of the &quot;wilderness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is Western romanticism to equate people with animals and they say culling is inhuman because they just want to come here to take photographs of our wildlife and get satisfied while local people are denied a source of income,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He notes that such groups use the political vote in their countries to influence their governments to withdraw support to organizations which they label as supporters of the killing of animals as if it is murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States' largest animal rights group is reported to be campaigning to discredit CAMPFIRE and put an end to funding for the programme from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS - Nigerian Christians have warned the country's military strongman not to try and convert himself from a military ruler into a civilian president as this west African country prepares for transition to democracy next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement issued here on March 21, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), an umbrella grouping Christians in the country, said that it &quot; strongly&quot; advised Abacha not to follow the trend of other African generals- turned presidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association &quot;strongly counselled the federal military government not to imitate those African countries where Military Heads of State took off their military uniforms and became civilian heads of state,&quot; said the statement, which was drawn up at the end of the CAN's national executive meeting here on March 19.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation has been rife in Nigeria for months that Abacha, who seized power in November 1993, will contest presidential elections due in October 1998, as the final stage in a transition to democracy in Africa's most populous nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On February 5, Abacha refuelled speculation that he may run for the presidency, saying the matter depended on him alone, according to the Nigerian press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The decision is my own constituency's. It is not new in Africa, neither is it new in the sub-region, that military people have stepped into politics,&quot; he told the Washington Times newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With that little phrase in his first interview in two years, picked up by the state News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) here, he thus sparked a new wave of intense debate on his plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under a programme for a gradual transfer of power to an elected civilian government, presidential elections are due to take place in Nigeria in late 1998. The military will hand over power to an elected president on October 1 that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation over an Abacha candidacy was first sparked last September by a comment by former Supreme Court head Mohammed Bello.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;According to the Constitution, all Nigerians have the right to participate in such an election, General Abacha is Nigerian. (A decision to run) would be nothing extraordinary, particularly in Africa where this sort of example is common,&quot; Bello said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha's regime seized power in November 1993, five months after a previous military junta annulled the results of a civilian presidential election, whose presumed winner Moshood Abiola is still in prison despite local and international uproar calling for his release.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's junta has since come under intense criticism for its record on human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Christians stressed that such a move in Nigeria would be &quot;fraught with perilous and far-reaching consequences, which will drastically impede the progress to healthy democracy and shake political stability to its roots.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CAN statement also warned Nigeria from joining the D-8 ministerial meeting early last January in Istanbul, Turkey. Other countries in the D-8 are predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan and Turkey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">VATICAN - As part of its efforts to strengthen Catholicism in predominantly Muslim Libya, the Holy See recently appointed Rev. Fr. Sylvester Carmel Magro as Vicar Apostolic for Benghazi in the north-east.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Vatican's weekly L'Osservatore Romano, English edition, the appointment was made on March 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic church weekly says the new appointment fills the gap left after the Libyan authorities expelled Bishop Giustino Guilio Pastorino, a member of the Order of Friars Minor (O.F.M.) or Franciscans, from the country in 1970.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Vicar Apostolic joins another Franciscan Bishop Giovanni Innocenzo Martinelli, the lone Catholic bishop, who is Vicar Apostolic for Tripoli, Libya's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alteration of church structures will certainly encourage the growth of understanding between Catholic hierarchy and the authorities, and a greater appreciation of the co-operation offered by men and women religious and, in general, by all the Catholics in the country, who are fully involved in the life of their society, the weekly notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya has an estimated 50,000 Catholics served by 12 priests and 80 religious women (nuns). There are 44 centres providing social assistance and health care, the church paper further says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the start in the recent years of great development projects, workers from various countries have come to Libya, spurring the church to increase her efforts for the Christian formation of newly arrived families, according to the weekly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The history of Christianity in North Africa, naturally brings to mind the church of St Augustine and the martyrs of the first centuries of Christianity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Christian faith later benefited from the apostolic activity of the sons of St Francis who, down the centuries, have maintained a discreet, hard- working presence even in the changed political and religious context of those lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christianity was fully integrated into the local situation, respectful and respected, and has left ancient traces such as the church of St. Mary of Angels, dating back to 1645 and located in the capital, Tripoli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L'Osservatore Romano says Libya is becoming an important ecumenical meeting point. Hundreds of thousands of Egyptian citizens reside there, many of whom are Coptic or Orthodox Christians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Holy See on March 10 established diplomatic relations with Libya and immediately appointed Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa as the Apostolic Nuncio in the north African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Holy See hopes that the establishment of diplomatic relations will reinforce and increase the bonds of friendship and co-operation which have existed for centuries between Catholics and the Libyan people,&quot; L'Osservatore Romano reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics provided by the World Christian Encyclopaedia indicate that 98.1 per cent of Libya's 4 million people are Muslims. The Christians represent about 1.7 per cent comprising mainly Catholics and Orthodox.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islam spread into this north African country from Arabia and Egypt in the second half of the seventh century, according to the encyclopaedia, edited by Rev. Dr. David Barrett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The author says; &quot;In north Africa, Christianity has had an ancient history, being the scene of the church's early expansion and the home of some of its most distinguished theologians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the combination of a failure to convert the Berbers and internal divisions due in part to Donatism weakened the church and made it impotent in the face of Muslim expansion in the seventh century, Dr. Barrett notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The region today has almost no indigenous professing Christian believers and Christianity is made up of Catholics and Orthodox from Greece and the Near East, in addition to a decreasing number of Protestants and Anglicans from Europe and North America, says Dr. Barrett, who researched on churches and religions in the modern world between AD 1900-2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expulsion of Italian colonists and American and British military personnel, together with Egyptians since 1974, has radically reduced Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant communities, the survey further says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Barrett adds; &quot;before the departure of Italians at the beginning of 1970, the Catholic church was divided into four ecclesiastical jurisdictions, namely the vicaries of Benghazi, Derna and Tripoli and the Prefecture of Misurata.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . ZAIRE - Complex Emergency, Fact Sheet 9, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, April 8, 1997. Note: The last fact sheet was dated April 3, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background: In mid-October 1996, fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 700,000 Rwandans and 62,000 Burundians to repatriate by the end of 1996. Hundreds of thousands of refugees also fled west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance gaining territory on all fronts. The Alliance now controls the eastern third of Zaire. On March 15, the Alliance captured Kisangani. As the Alliance advances towards its next stated goal of Lubumbashi, it has already seized Kamina, a strategic rail junction located to the northwest of Lubumbashi, and Kasenga, 200 km northeast of Lubumbashi. The Alliance captured Mbuji-Mayi, the diamond capital of Zaire, on April 5 and Kipushi, 30 km west of Lubumbashi, on April 7. Talks between Alliance and Zairian government authorities began in South Africa on April 5.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haut-Zaire Province: Approximately 89,000 Rwandan refugees are clustered in three groups along the 125 km rail line west of the Zaire River, south of Kisangani: 57,000 at km 25, 31,000 at km 41, and 1,000 at km 82. Humanitarian agencies have set up food, water sources, medical facilities, and services for unaccompanied children at each site. Relief organizations are concerned about high rates of severe malnutrition, dehydration and high fever, presumably caused by malaria. The United Nations (U.N.) High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) repatriation plan, approved by the Alliance on April 5, envisions flying the most vulnerable refugees from Kisangani to Goma, where they will be trucked to Gisenyi, Rwanda. Rwandan army soldiers will then screen the refugees at the Nkamira transit center before they are transported home. UNHCR hopes that the balance of the refugees can also be repatriated by air. Displaced and war-affected Zairians are also receiving assistance.  Missionary sources report that 4,000 of the 39,000 registered internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kisangani have returned home. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is also planning to airlift some of the remaining IDPs to Goma or Bukavu. Foraging by the refugees, ex-FAR, and Interahamwe has affected food availability in villages between Ubundu and km 25. WFP has begun food distributions to these affected Zairians. To help coordinate movements of refugees and IDPs, the British Overseas Development Agency is establishing an air logistics center in Goma and a ground logistics center in Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kivu Province: On March 31, UNHCR reported that 20,000 - 30,000 Rwandan refugees emerged at Karuba, 13 km west of Sake. Another 2,500 emerged at Tongo, west of the former camps of Katale and Kahindo, north of Goma. Once the refugees are screened by Alliance forces, UNHCR trucks them directly to the Rwandan border. On April 4 - 5, 4,166 refugees repatriated, including 151 unaccompanied children, 3,819 refugees from Karuba, 168 from Tongo, 19 from Sake, and 12 spontaneous repatriations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasai-Oriental Province: Before the Alliance seizure of Mbuji-Mayi, there were reports of 2,000 refugees near the town. At least 30,000 refugees are moving towards Angola. They are believed to be the group who fled the Shabunda area camps in South Kivu. U.S. Government (USG) Assistance: On March 14, USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) arrived in the region to help advance relief efforts in eastern Zaire. USAID/DART installed an information officer in Nairobi, a field officer in Goma, and a field officer in Kisangani. On April 5, USAID/DART assessed the condition of refugees at km 25, accompanied by UNDHA and EU officials. Two doctors from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived on April 5 in Goma and have been seconded to UNICEF.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Today the Standing Committee on Public Accounts and Finance in the Provincial Legislature began meeting to discuss the delayed provincial budget tabled by MEC Meiring on 2 April. A general discussion was held and three votes were discussed i.e. PUBLIC WORKS, ROADS AND TRANSPORT, AGRICULTURE and the ENVIRONMENT, CULTURAL AFFAIRS AND TOURISM VOTES.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC expressed its concern that the standing committee was at no point consulted concerning the budget crisis. This once again showed a failure on the part of the executive to involve the legislature. We expressed our deep concern at the decision by MEC Meiring to budget for a deficit and thus did not accept the explanation by treasury officials that nothing in current legislation prevented the province from taking this step. ANC members of the committee have thus called on the chairperson Mr Arnold De Jager (NP) to invite the director general of state expenditure, Mr Hannes Smit to appear before the committee.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In regard to the vote on transport, roads and public works, ANC members called on the department to make available a draft asset register by June of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has emerged very clearly that the MEC for Education and Culture has no plan on the table concerning the spending of the R13 million allocated for culture. This programme has increased from R300 000 to R13 million from last year and cannot be justified in the context of a deficit. It clearly is nothing more than a cultural discretionary slush fund. The ANC will be formally moving that R12 million is cut from this vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is clear that scope exists for savings in all these votes in regard to posts which are FUNDED BUT NOT YET FILLED. In the public works vote, 500 posts are funded but not yet filled. In Agriculture, 239 posts are funded but not yet filled. The ANC is convinced that savings can be effected by not filling all these posts. If a total of 1000 posts are not filled across all votes a saving of at least R100 million is possible. We have requested full information concerning the number of severance packages granted in the province and how much this will save the province. This information has not yet been made available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We will make further proposals during the week aimed at trimming R55 million from the budget and hope they will be accepted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC in KwaZulu Natal is gravely concerned about the drop of listenership of Radio Ukhozi from 5,7 m to 4,7 m listeners. This is a drop of a million listeners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Radio Ukhozi is the main source of information to the poorest of the poor in KwaZulu Natal. To ascribe this massive drop to the mushrooming of community radio stations alone is to avoid the real issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem lies in the quality of service rendered by Radio Ukhozi. There is a remarkable drop on the standard of service rendered by Radio Ukhozi.  This is coupled by the fact that listeners now have a choice of community radio stations. This situation may be worsened by the fact that SAPA has severed its relations with the SABC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC suggests that the SABC management must undergo introspection of the way Radio Ukhozi is managed, resourced, programmed and how personnel is deployed according to their skills and experience. It is also a fact that Radio Ukhozi is the biggest and the most profitable among all other stations in the SABC KwaZulu Natal region and throughout South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore crucial that those who are at managerial positions, especially the news section in KwaZulu Natal SABC region, are proficient also in Zulu. This is for practical reasons and the monitoring of the presentation of programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There must also be an acceptance that Radio Ukhozi is not a personal property of the SABC management. The SABC must accept constructive criticism from the public and not always adopt a defensive posture.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC National Working Committee (NWC) meeting in Johannesburg today, Monday 7 April has taken a decision to expel Bhekumuzi Gabriel &quot;Sifiso&quot; Nkabinde from the ANC with immediate effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irrefutable evidence brought to the NWC's attention has established that Nkabinde has not been a bona fide member of the organisation but was infiltrated by the apartheid security establishment, as an agent provocateur, to destabilise and destroy the ANC from within as well as forment inter- communal so-called &quot;black on black&quot; violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among others he was tasked by his handlers to perform the following tasks:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* provide information on the activities of the ANC including leadership structures into which he was infiltrated.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* report on the activities of our erstwhile army Umkhonto We Sizwe and popular self-defence units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* and furnish information on the activities of the mass democratic movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde operated under the alias of Derrick Nene with the agent number SR 4252. The ANC is in posession of the names of his handlers and reports he submitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has information that leads us to believe that Nkabinde was involved in activities that led to destabilisation in some parts of Kwazulu/Natal that could have resulted in the deaths of some of our members and supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NWC has had to act with urgency regarding this matter because activities he is currently involved in, are aggravating the problems in KwaZulu/Natal particularly the Midlands region. As such his continued presence in the midst of the ANC would have afforded him the cover to further undermine peace and stability in the region and the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His expulsion from the ANC removes him from any and all other positions that he may have held on account of his false membership including the KwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC demands that all security force members who have been his handlers now and in the past come forward with a full disclosure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Egypt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brief description of the situation: The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), a member of the network, has expressed its grave concern for the students, Mustafa Zedan, Ahmad Taha Qandeel, Mohammed Abdel-Haleem, Tamer Soliman, and Mohammed El-Ba'ali, who were arrested and tortured by Egyptian security officials between 26 and 30 March. According to the information received, they were arrested following their participation in peaceful demonstrations at the Cairo University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday 26 March 1997, security forces arrested Mustafa Zedan, and Ahmad Taha Qandeel as they were taking a taxi after leaving the university.  At dawn on Thursday 27 March 1997, security forces raided the house of student Mohammed Abdel-Haleem and arrested him after searching the house and confiscating some materials.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 27 March 1997, these three students were referred to the State Security Prosecution which ordered a detention of 15 days pending investigation. They were accused of possession of leaflets and other printed materials that &quot; would disturb peace and harm public interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, on 30 March, the security forces arrested a further two Tamer Soliman, and Mohammed El-Ba'ali. On 31 March, they were referred to the State Security Prosecution, which ordered their detention for 15 days pending investigations. They were accused of the same charges. According to the information, they stated before the State Security Prosecution that they were subjected to two hours of severe torture in the Giza office during the state security investigations, including electric shocks, beating and kicking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the information received, all of the students mentioned above were involved a demonstration at the Cairo University protesting the settlements policies of Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, according to the information received, in connection with the above-mentioned demonstration, the house of the student Samah Helmi was raided by security forces at dawn on 29 March, but she was not arrested because she was not there. Shereen Megahid was referred to the disciplinary board and on 30 March, the University vice president summoned the father of student Areeg Ibrahim, who reportedly had been subjected to strong pressure by the university authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Secretariat expresses its grave concern over the physical and psychological well being of the students mentioned above. The Secretariat also underlines that the arrests, harassment, and torture are clear violations of constitutional rights to peaceful assembly and free expression of opinion and of Egypt's international obligations as a State party to Convention Against Torture the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). These treaties forbid the practice of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, which are, by virtue of Article 151 of the Egyptian Constitution, part of Egyptian law. These arrests also violate article 21 of the ICCPR which affirms the right to everyone to association and peaceful assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action requested: Please write to the authorities of Egypt urging them to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i. take all the necessary measures to guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mustafa Zedan, Ahmad Taha Qandeel, Mohammed Abdel- Haleem, Tamer Soliman, Mohammed El-Ba'ali, Samah Helmi, Shereen Megahid, and Areeg Ibrahim;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii. order the immediate release of the students arrested in the absence of valid legal charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before an impartial and competent tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iii. open a full impartial inquiry into the events, identify all those responsible and bring them totrial and apply the penal, civil and /or administrative sanctions provided by legislation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iv. ensure in all circumstances respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national laws and international standards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), and Robert Menard, general secretary, Reporters Sans Frontieres, April 4, 1997, to His Excellency President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Reporters Sans Frontieres(RSF), independent organizations working to defend press freedom worldwide, wish to protest the detention of Expo-Times publisher Ibrahim Seaga Shaw and editors Gibril Koroma and Abayomi Charles Roberts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to our information, Shaw, Koroma, and Roberts, of the privately owned biweekly newspaper Expo-Times, have been detained in Pademba Road prison since 19 March 1997. In court the prosecutor accused them of having &quot; obtained secret official documents and extracts containing secret military information which might be used directly or indirectly by an enemy against the State.&quot; If convicted of treason, the journalists face a prison sentence of up to 15 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists' arrests are believed to be in connection with an article published in the 19 March issue of Expo-Times titled &quot;Abacha's Gangsterism.&quot; The article alleged that the arrest in Nigeria, of Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leader Foday Sankoh was a stratagem to remove Sankoh from his position as the head of the RUF. Nigerian authorities and the management of the RUF have denied the information published in Expo-Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists, in a recent issue the newspaper clearly stated that its intention was not to disturb diplomatic relations with Nigeria. Shaw, Koroma, and Roberts have appeared in court on four separate occasions and the court has denied all the journalists' applications for bail. The journalists are expected to appear in a higher court on 7 April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As nonpartisan groups of journalists dedicated to the promotion of press freedom worldwide, CPJ and RSF condemn the arrests of Shaw, Koroma, and Roberts and their continued detention as grave attacks on press freedom and a blatant violation of their right to hold and express opinions and ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This right is guaranteed by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees the right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind,&quot; and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, to which Sierra Leone is a signatory.  CPJ and RSF call on Your Excellency to remember that the manifesto of the Sierra Leonean People's Party, on the basis of which you were elected, states that &quot;every effort will be made to upgrade our mass media facilities to 21st century standards, with emphasis on community style radio and a vibrant and free press.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, CPJ and RSF remind you that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights says &quot;detention, as punishment for the peaceful expression of an opinion, is one of the most reprehensible ways to enjoin silence and, as a consequence, a grave violation of human rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency, CPJ and RSF strongly urge you to do everything in your power to ensure that Shaw, Koroma and Roberts are granted bail and guaranteed a fair trial. We thank you for your attention to this matter and welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

Also mentioned with regard to labour were efforts made to harmonize economic reform programmes and the workers and ensure that international labour standards are made the guiding principles at all stages of the reform programmes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

The one-day symposium was attended by 70 specialists and opened by Ato Assrat Bulbula, Ethiopian Scientific and Technology Commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Fekadu kebede, President of the Ethiopian Association of Seismology and Earthquake Engineering, aid in a welcoming address that earthquakes are an expression of the continuing evolution of the earth and its surface. He further noted that they are &quot;the most deadly of natural disasters&quot; affecting the human environment. &quot;Catastrophic earthquakes have indeed marked the whole of human history, accounting for 60% of global casualties associated with natural disasters,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, economic damage caused by natural disasters and by earthquakes in particular are increasing with time. the long-term effects of a catastrophic earthquake (the disruption of the economic chain, human resettlement, the reconstruction to modern standards, etc.) may last for decades and absorb a considerable part of a national budget Dr. Fekadu added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the most disastrous earthquakes which caused enormous damages to property and losses of human lives in Ethiopia, Dr. Fekadu mentioned: the 1961-Kara Koe, 1969 - central Afar, 1987 - Southern Ethiopia, 1989 Dobi Graben (central Afar), 1993 - Nazareth, 1985 Langano and 1995 Awasa earthquakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the president of the association, a good data base collected over several years is necessary to tackle the problem scientifically. for this purpose, he noted, a continuos monitoring of seismic activity and collection of data is going on at seismic stations inside and outside Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The papers which were presented at the symposium were expected to look deeper into the problem again from different angles and make the members and concerned organizations aware of the problem and progress, Dr. Fekadu said, and expressed his hope that the results will make a basis for future revision of the building code or the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, Dr. Fekadu thanked the Ethiopian Science and Technology Commission, Addis Ababa University, and the Building Design Enterprise for their financial help in organizing of the symposium and the Faculty of Technology for hosting it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape-based stationery and office furniture company Waltons is not expected to show any improvement over its interim results when it reports results for the full year to February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a presentation to journalists and investment analysts yesterday, Pepkor chief executive Jan le Roux said a lot of things had gone wrong at Waltons and &quot;we can be accused of not acting earlier to protect this very sizeable investment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mr Le Roux said a thorough investigation was being conducted into the various businesses of Waltons whereafter &quot;we will work very closely&quot; with Waltons' management to restore the company to acceptable levels of profitability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carel Stassen, a director of Pepkor, has been given the responsibility of safeguarding Pepkor's investment in Waltons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pepkor owns 44 percent of Waltons' parent company Walhold as well as a 12 percent direct stake in Waltons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Waltons' poor performance was about the only sore point of the presentation for the Pepkor group. The presentation was held to reassure the investment community that Pepkor chairman Christo Wiese had not &quot;lost interest&quot; in his retail investment arm in favour of his banking interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wiese recently resigned as chief executive of Pepkor and handed the reins to Mr Le Roux, Pepkor's third-largest shareholder and its chief financial officer in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Perhaps the best answer to some of these questions is to refer to what we see as the future structure of Samgro,&quot; Mr Wiese said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samgro is currently the holding company for Mr Wiese's interests in NBS- Boland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the options under consideration is that Samgro will house all my personal interests in the retail and financial services sectors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Samgro will thus have two legs, very distinctive and independent, but nevertheless compatible and synergystic. The most obvious link will be in- store banking.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wiese hoped to have in-store banking up and running in Shoprite stores before the end of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Wiese believed the &quot;real benefit&quot; of in-store banking lay with the &quot; millions of people&quot; who shop at Pep and had no banking experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wiese pointed out that there were twice as many Pep outlets in South Africa as post offices and was in a unique position to bring banking its customers through its tills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the future for Pep's traditional business of selling clothing, footwear and textiles to the mass market also looks promising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Le Roux said it was the Pep customer who would benefit most from the recent Budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We strongly believe the effect of Pep's new information systems ...  coupled with an agressive new store development programme and agressive advertising campaign will see an annual increase in turnover of 20 percent over the next three years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Big business and crime fighters are at loggerheads over a campaign to sell wine and beer at supermarkets and grocery shops after hours and on Sundays</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If some of the most Draconian liquor legislation in the world - which regulated not only when, where and how but also who was allowed to partake of alcohol - was unable to stop South Africans drinking for the best part of this century, it is highly unlikely that restricting sales in this age of individual liberty will make any difference to consumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn argues that the shocking level of crime will soar if more shops are allowed to sell wine and beer and sales are permitted on Sundays. He says alcohol plays an overwhelming role in criminal behaviour, from driving under its influence to domestic violence, murder and rape.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Limiting the places where legal supplies are available or cutting them off for one day a week is not going to help. A hangover from a time when sales were even more strictly controlled is the fact that if one wants liquor, one can get it regardless of the lateness of the hour or day of the week. In shebeens everywhere, willing sellers will supply willing buyers almost around the clock at prices competitive with legal outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liquor legislation has already been significantly relaxed in line with the new South African philosophy of less, not more regulation. More shops are selling liquor, opening hours are longer and some outlets are licensed to sell on Sundays. It is therefore perfectly reasonable for the three supermarket chains about to challenge Liquor Act restrictions in the Constitutional Court - and for that matter the grocer on the corner - to demand their share of the economic action and for their customers to insist on the additional service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it may be a contributing factor, there are far more social ills at the root of crime which need serious attention than liquor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling the last round on Saturdays is not the answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - They should call him &quot;The Voice&quot;. I'm talking about Leslie McKenzie - broadcaster and radio journalist for more than 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tune in to Fine Music Radio and you will hear his deep, well-modulated tones - the perfect radio voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he know this?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes I have been told that. I don't agree with it. I hate listening to myself. I cringe each time I hear it on the air if I have made a recording. I try and listen to it because I've got to pick up the mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The confidence I think I gained at the microphone was in realising that it's actually a lot of fun ... you really are an ordinary person talking to ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not qualified in anything. I passed matric and that's all. I didn't have any other qualifications. I couldn't afford to go to university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I read quite a lot and when possible I read the newspapers to try and keep up with current affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I'm an expert in nothing and a dabbler in everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Leslie doesn't say is that he is very much an expert when it comes to broadcasting and radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been with just about every radio station of note in this country (having begun with the old English Service in Cape Town). His afternoon talk- show on Radio South Africa, Talkabout, was one of the most popular programmes and won several awards during the six years that he produced and presented it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 he was snapped up by Cape Town's Fine Music Radio and he now runs the programming and presentation side of that station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But how nerve-racking being on radio must be; so unforgiving, I suggest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always say to myself, 'Look, if there's a disaster you can't die'. The worst that can happen is that there's a bit of silence while you say there appears to be a bit of a problem ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it's McKenzie's natural and marvellously robust sense of humour that I enjoy most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a knack of lampooning himself (and sometimes others) - maybe subconsciously. &quot;I can't take a meeting seriously. When people sit in a meeting and get terribly intense about it (he tightens the muscles in his face mockingly), I try and look for the funny side, and it's very difficult not to come up with an off-beat comment and not take the mickey out of somebody or something that is being said.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's a great admirer of Churchill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's been my hero, maybe partly because I have a similar bulldog look. As a kid I was likened to a film star at the time called Butch Jenkins. I never knew him as a child, but I could imagine the ugly little freckled face that must have appeared on the screen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was always a chubby little person with freckles, which I was always conscious about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And yet he was a star and I thought, 'Well, if he can make it, I can too, but not in movies.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And once I got into radio, I had a little bit more confidence in myself and I decided: 'Let yourself just believe in yourself'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps because he didn't come from a well-to-do home, Leslie still has the common touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a particular concern for youngsters who are not able to achieve the very basics of what they want out of life and relationships ... kids from disadvantaged or poor homes ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know the traumas and the peer pressures, the awareness of the fact that you can't afford the new shoes that your friends have.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McKenzie says his worst fault is his short temper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's very easy to lose your temper in this job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have a very short fuse. I lose patience with people very quickly, in situations where people are too set in their own ways and too dogmatic and will not listen to another side of the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I often wish that I were a dictator, so that I could listen to various sides and then make a decision and say, 'That's the way we do it.' Boom!  Finished!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does he have any regrets when he looks back at his life?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;None at all. I've had a charmed life. I say thank you to the Maker frequently and quietly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By anybody's standards Leslie McKenzie has been immensely successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his career has been one of waxing and waning, he points out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he became head of the then commercial service Springbok Radio 21 months after joining the SABC, he says, he felt triumphant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He loves what he does because &quot;it's more than just a vocation. It's actually a hobby that enables me to pay the rent and the electricity, and buy a little bit of food now and again.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones, backed by Gauteng soul group Family Factory, is the lead singer of the song Olympic Fever written, composed and produced by Selwyn Shandel and Stan Lurie to project an upbeat message about the bid and generate public enthusiasm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones made her mark as a top South African talent when she performed the theme song for the 1995 rugby World Cup at the opening ceremony at Newlands.  She also sang the song to commemorate officially the adoption of the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her Olympic Fever record also features rhythm guitarist Louis Mhlanga and Cape Town sax maestro Robbie Janssen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lyrics, by Shandel and Lurie, seek to rally the public behind the &quot; chance of a lifetime&quot; project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second verse projects the essential message: The Mother City/with beauty so bold/star of Africa/reaching for gold/c'mon everybody/let the Games begin/let's make it happen/we're all gonna win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The song could be put out for commercial release soon.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Robben Island's transformation from political prison to premier tourist destination has brought more than its fair share of problems as people clamour to get the hottest tickets in town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another controversy involving the Robben Island museum erupted at the weekend, this time over the advance sale of tickets to people visiting the island.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Canadian couple were incensed at having to stand in a queue of about 150 people for more than an hour-and-a-half on Friday, only to be told that just 30 tickets for the island were available that day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Yaccato and his wife Patricia were angry that most of the tickets had been bought beforehand from tour operators, although they had been told they could buy tickets only on the day of the trip from the museum's Waterfront offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The couple were unable to get tickets and had to cancel their trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say that they should have been told the tickets were already sold out, saving them from queuing unnecessarily. They also say they should have been told by the staff at the Waterfront where to get tickets in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Robben Island spokeswoman said large crowds thronged the Island's Waterfront office over Easter and over the previous weekend, resulting in many people being turned away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She denied that only 30 people were allowed on to the island on Friday, saying that the normal quota of about 300 had been accommodated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally about half of the tickets available were sold in advance and the rest were allocated to people in the queue. She added that people were told when the tickets were sold out and did not have to stand in the queue unnecessarily. The island's management had always sold tickets in advance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening of Robben Island to tourism has been plagued with problems.  Soon after its opening, island authorities blocked the prison entrance to stop hundreds of passengers from four charter boats which had taken them to the island in defiance of regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The African National Congress is challenging clauses of the Western Cape's proposed provincial constitution in the Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial legislature recently adopted the constitution, which still needs the court's ratification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the ANC's objections to the clauses are successful, the court could throw out the constitution, as was the case with the KwaZulu Natal provincial constitution. The ANC has problems with the clause providing for cultural councils as it is in conflict with the provisions of the national constitution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesmen said cultural councils were a smokescreen to bring in cultural apartheid through the back door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitution did not have enough safeguards to prevent Premier Hernus Kriel kicking ANC members out of the provincial cabinet when the constitution had been ratified by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation, vehemently denied by Mr Kriel, has been mounting that the premier intends reshuffling his cabinet and replacing ANC ministers with National Party and Democratic Party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The provincial constitution, although securing the number of ANC portfolios until 1999, does not secure the integrity of the ANC portfolios.  Thus Premier Kriel could after certification (of the provincial constitution) throw out ANC ministers after consultation,&quot; the ANC said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party said it also objected to provisions allowing the premier to appoint four more provincial ministers. It also objected to the clause stipulating that 60 percent of the legislature may, after the next elections, vote to continue a government of provincial unity, which the ANC wants to end in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party said the inclusion of the clause providing for a constituency- based electoral system, which differs from the national electoral system, reduced the prospects of the provincial constitution being certified by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC also wanted a clause specifying that previous labour practices of all companies tendering for government contracts be considered before they were awarded contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC also called on the Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions to lodge separate objections with the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The costs of implementing all the provisions of the provincial constitution has been conservatively estimated at R112-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This includes the cost of a different electoral system, four extra provincial ministers, new provincial commissioners and cultural councils.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Heavily armed public order police and soldiers in camouflage uniforms are patrolling the Cape Flats at night to prevent war between anti- drug vigilantes and gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patrols were implemented after clashes between supporters of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs and the Hard Livings gang in Manenberg on Sunday and attacks on homes of suspected drug dealers yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest incidents, a man was killed in a drive-by shooting near his Steenberg home, several people were injured and nine Pagad members were arrested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month homes of gangsters and Pagad leaders were attacked with petrol bombs and handgrenades. Gary Lotz of Brooklyn was killed. It was suspected that he had been mistakenly identified by gunmen apparently looking for a neighbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Hendrik Pistorius said no incidents involving the two groups had been reported last night or early today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police Casspirs and armoured army vans drove from Manenberg police station about 6pm to patrol hotspots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers received two false alarms last night when false messages about attacks on the home of a drug dealer in Lincoln Estate, Athlone, were sent to a pager service in the name of Pagad spokesman Sharief Khan. No such attacks occurred. Mr Khan was unavailable for comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Areas where gangsters have been active were earmarked for visible patrols, including Manenberg, Woodstock, Mitchell's Plain, Brooklyn and Sea Point. The joint army and police patrol watched Kings Road flats in Brooklyn, where Mr Lotz was shot, but everything appeared quiet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Superintendent Pistorius said police co-operation with the army could be extended to include policing of areas of high crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police investigating attacks on Pagad and gangsters have compiled a comprehensive data base of incidents and the profiles of people involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They hope this will help curb bombings, firearm attacks and illegally-held marches. Provincial police spokesman John Sterrenberg said the authorities appreciated the community's involvement in fighting crime and trying to rid the Peninsula of drugs and gangsterism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it is a recipe for self-destruction to take the law into your own hands,&quot; he said. &quot;The community and police together could be a formidable united front against crime, but when people out there fight crime with crime, it is a step backwards that wastes valuable time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are proper channels of communication between the community and the police where information about illegal activities can be reported,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town's highway to hell - that is the grim reputation of Vanguard Drive, on which more people die than on any other road in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the road, from the Viking Way intersection in Epping to Mitchell's Plain, is highlighted in the latest traffic accident statistics as the scene of the highest number of fatalities in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been at least 18 accidents there in the past year in which people died.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several crossings along Vanguard Drive are among the 10 worst intersections in the city for collisions. These include Viking Way (73 accidents), Jakkalsvlei Road (48), Klipfontein Road (55) and Highlands Drive (37).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residents near accident hotspots along Vanguard Drive are demanding an end to the carnage. Some point fingers at minibus taxi drivers, whom they accuse of speeding, jumping robots and reckless driving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others blame traffic authorities for failing to maintain a visible presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Danny and Ruth Adonis of Vanguard Estate are so incensed by speeding on roads in their area that they are considering a petition to have speed bumps built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Accidents occur at regular intervals. This piece of road is like a race track; speed bumps will help a lot,&quot; said Mr Adonis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shamiela Hartzenberg, who lives on the corner of Vanguard Drive and Jakkalsvlei Road in Bonteheuwel, said there was an accident at the intersection virtually &quot;every second day&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very dangerous on these roads. Traffic cops should control the area and ticket offenders immediately. I have seen many pedestrians being knocked down on these roads,&quot; said Mrs Hartzenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her sentiments were echoed by her neighbour, 18-year-old Lizette Organsie, who said traffic officers should be more visible in the area. &quot;There are a lot of accidents around here because a lot of people just go through the red robots as they please and disobey the rules of the road.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jean Rossouw of Vanguard Estate said roads in the area were so dangerous she hardly crossed them any more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think taxis are the main cause of accidents on these roads,&quot; said Mrs Rossouw.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Details of the worst accident spots were released to the Cape Argus at its request, in a move which signals a new approach to traffic management in the city. New traffic manager Mark Sangster has vowed to target the worst accident spots as a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, some of the other accident hotspots are virtually on the doorstep of the traffic department headquarters at Gallows Hill in Green Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Main Road in Sea Point and Green Point and the notorious double intersections in Buitengracht Street are among the worst roads for accidents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stretch of road experiencing the most collisions in one year is Main Road in Green Point and Sea Point - with 387, two of them fatal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - The Nigerian Stock Exchange launched a Central Securities Clearing System on Tuesday, which traders say could mark a turning point in the efforts by the exchange to revolutionize its activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inaugurating the scheme, Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, the number two in Nigeria's military administration said it was a major step in the process of &quot;jump- starting our economy in order to mark it a concrete and credible player in the international market place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Nigerian Stock Exchange had, over the years, been highly rated in spite of its limitations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exchange, he added, was now capable of processing increased volume and turnover of securities with &quot;greater efficiency, transparency and at reduced cost to investors.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the exchange, Paschal Dozie, said the new clearing system would serve as a central depositary for all the share certificates of quoted securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would also provide a sub-registry for all quoted securities in conjunction with the registrars of quoted companies, issuance of central securities identification numbers to stock holders and the clearing, settlement and custodial services for local and foreign instruments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The dynamics of the Nigerian capital market,&quot; Dozie said, &quot;will from today undergo beneficial radical transformation which will unfold with time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozie said the system &quot;will continuously be enhanced and upgraded as the volume of transactions increase and new and varied instruments are introduced into the capital market as the market develops and become more sophisticate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme, which started in 1989, is expected to enhance the delivery system of the Nigerian capital market, through the introduction of efficient and effective securities clearing settlement and custodian mechanisms with minimum risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before now the transfer of shares and production of new certificates for traded securities between the stockbrokers and the registrar took a few months to conclude, while processing of transactions on the floors of the exchange were carried out manually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This created delays affecting the operational efficiency of the capital market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it took up to seven working days for brokers to pay for transactions previously, the new clearing system requires the selected banks to reconcile the accounts of the brokers as soon as they received instructions from the central clearing system after the day's trading.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials of the Nigerian Stock Exchange say the system is to function as a subsidiary of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stockbrokers are required to have enough funds in their accounts with any of the four selected banks before they can engage in trading on the floor of the exchange on any particular day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say the modernization is expected to boost exchange's growth and enhance its performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to official records, the exchange's market turnover increased significantly in 1996 with a total of 882 million shares valued at 7.058 billion naira. This was in contrast to 397 million shares worth 1.838 billion naira achieved in 1995 (85 naira = 1 U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market capitalization of the exchange was put at 285.6 billion naira in 1996 as against 171.1 billion naira recorded at the end of 1995, while the All-Shares Index also rose by 37.3 percent from 5092.15 to 6992.10 in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issues market recorded impressive performance with the approval of 36 new issues worth 21.45 billion naira in contrast to 31 worth 7.084 billion naira in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the aggressive campaign by the exchange to attract foreign investors, a total of 32.98 million dollars was invested in the Nigerian capital market by foreigners in 1996 as against 1.137 million dollars in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dozie believes that with the introduction of the new clearing system, the turnover of the exchange could hit some 10 billion naira in 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we succeed in our plan in reactivating trading in the gilts and industrial bonds, then this estimate will be exceeded,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the strategic plan of the exchange, the call-over trading system of the exchange is to be moved to the automated trading system this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts will also be made to expand the scope of the internet services of the exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Large price gains have remained in vogue at the Nigerian stock market in 1997 as confident buyers continued to pour money into shares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But some operators recently called on the exchange to check what they called &quot;the violent equity price fluctuations and the persistent bullish tendencies&quot; on the exchange. &quot;The Nigerian capital market to a large extent is an artificial creation made possible by stockbrokers who control more than 98 percent of market information to the disadvantage of most investors,&quot; said Christopher Eze, the managing director of John Holt, a major quoted company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the unsalutary economic environment made it imperative for the regulatory authorities to re-evaluate the indices of equity pricing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eze said that unless equity pricing procedures were modified to reflect the dynamic nature of company price earnings ratio, investors, especially unquoted companies, would remain skeptical about the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director-general of the Securities and Exchange Commission, George Akamiokhor, has also warned that the recorded daily percentage increase of equities under the present economic climate might precipitate a market crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He called for the intervention of the exchange, especially in stock pricing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from this worrisome development, the introduction of the new central clearing system and the extension of the internet services of the exchange are expected to position the stock exchange adequately for the challenges of a growing domestic economy and internationalization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a joint statement issued in Lusaka, the five organizations urged their members to support actions aimed at stopping the introduction of the law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Media Council Bill seeks to regulate the media, introduce the compulsory registration of journalists, set qualifications for journalists and institute a disciplinary body for media practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council, according to the bill, published in Monday's issue of the state-owned daily newspaper, the Times of Zambia, will have the power to reprimand, suspend or withdraw accreditation to offending journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Any journalist who ceases to be accredited for whatever reason will be committing an offence which can attract up to three months imprisonment or a fine if he or she continued to practice in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To practice, journalists must have attained the age of 18, hold of a bachelor of arts degree in mass communication obtained from a university or learning institution recognized by the council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicant will also be required to have completed at least two years training in journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council shall be composed of a journalist employed by the government- owned print media, a representative of the Press Association, the Union of Journalists, a nominee from the private print media, the Media Women Association and a representative from media institutions involved in the training of journalists and the broadcasting industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their statement, the five bodies said the licensing of journalists and such things and imprisonment and fines constituted an infringement of the journalists' freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists said they were opposed to the use of legislation to control the media, whether or not such legislation was driven by the media themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media bill was announced by President Frederick Chiluba when he opened his second term's parliament in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed law has also been opposed by the London-based Commonwealth Press Union and the International Press Institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The director of the Commonwealth Press Union, Robin Mackichen, said Tuesday that the protest should be coordinated, on behalf of relevant press freedom organizations, by the World Press Freedom Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Press Institute's press freedom advisor, Michael Kudlak, added that the bill contravened Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The declaration states that everyone has the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Namibia has reversed its earlier intention to withdraw from the 20-nation Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (Comesa), it confirmed Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's trade and industry deputy minister, Wilfried Emvula, said that the problems that were affecting the organization at the time Windhoek wanted to withdraw had now been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out the vague relationship between Comesa and the 12-nation Southern African Development Community (Sadc), to which Namibia is also a member, as the main reason that had prompted Windhoek to consider reviewing its membership with Comesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After studying a report which was done on how Sadc and Comesa intended to work to avoid duplication of their work, we are now at peace and clear as to how the two groups will cooperate,&quot; Emvula told PANA.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botswana and South Africa are the only other Southern African states which have never joined Comesa. Ten Sadc members also belong to Comesa, created in 1992 as a market for the east, central and southern Africa, with 300 million inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Emvula, who is heading Namibia's delegation at the on-going Comesa Council of Ministers meeting in Lusaka, claimed that Comesa's future was at stake because a majority of its members belong to Sadc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that dual membership to the two regional bodies raised the problems of loyalty, given that there was no clear direction as to which way the two organizations could avoid duplication of their programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Donors and some member-states in the organizations have been urging a merger of the two bodies, to avoid duplicating development efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesotho and Mozambique announced in December 1996 that they would pull out of Comesa after a year's notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesotho confirmed Tuesday that it had decided to withdraw from Comesa because of the issue of duplication and overlapping of programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesotho's principal secretary for trade and industry, Lefa Mokotjo, told PANA that the uncoordinated manner of the program by the two organizations had made it difficult for Maseru to implement Comesa and Sadc programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that as a small country, Lesotho also felt that it was stretched in manpower resources to manage the ongoing economic changes of the region, at the international level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are rapid changes that have been brought by the World Trade Organization which we have to oblige to. Given that our manpower requirements are quite stretched, we felt better to have a bit of focus on what we can manage,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesotho, he said, had opted to remain in Sadc because of its major commitment to coordinating the water development and environment sectors in the region to which the country has been assigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that it was difficult for Lesotho to absorb Comesa's sector responsibility it had been assigned and also manage its other responsibility from the Southern African Customs Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our withdrawal from Comesa does not in any way relate to how Comesa is conducting itself. It is no way a reflection of any bad faith in Comesa. It is just a practical move,&quot; Mokotjo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokotjo is leading his country's delegation to the council of ministers meeting preparing for Thursday's heads of state summit in the Zambian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues to be discussed at the summit include the envisaged withdrawal of Lesotho and Mozambique from Comesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mozambique's foreign minister, Leonardo Simao, said the country will not take part in Thursday's summit.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said the Mozambican government's decision aims at dedicating more attention to Sadc, of which it was elected deputy-president in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have already suspended our participation in the works of Comesa,&quot; he told the country's news agency, AIM, Monday. &quot;Our withdrawal from the organization has been officially informed to the Comesa secretariat.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - African countries and institutions are not benefiting from the foreign-dominated oil trade industry despite the opportunities which could propel the continent into making significant earnings and savings from this energy sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, some extra-continental countries were using the continent's resources to make a profit out of Africa, a coordinator of the forthcoming African oil trade conference, Clive Mutiso, said Tuesday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency, Ziana, that market deregulation in most of Africa presented opportunities for institutions to explore the non-traditional aspects of the industry, such as finance and insurance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference opens Monday in Harare, the Zimbabwe capital. At least 200 delegates from across the world, representing decision makers and customers, are expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-day conference is expected to provide details, for the first time, of the infrastructure and financial needs created by national energy strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying to give Africa and its institutions a bigger share in the profits of the African oil trade,&quot; Mutiso said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African countries, he said, should be able to attract local investors in the form of reinsurance companies and other indigenous concerns, departing from reliance on government, state-owned firms and multinationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For instance, the financing and insurance of oil trade is big business and big profits because the standards of safety are very high,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited the example of Zimbabwe where players in the oil trade were paying high insurance premiums. Because there had never been a claim in a long time now, the reinsurance companies abroad were making huge profits, Mutiso said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, he said, also needed to invest in infrastructure to exploit different kinds of fuel such as liquid petroleum gas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Nigerian chief of army staff, Maj. Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, arrived in Monrovia on Tuesday to inspect troops of the West African Peace Monitoring Force for Liberia, Ecomog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecomog said Bamaiyi was received at Monrovia's Roberts International Airport by the regional force's commander, Maj. Gen. Victor Malu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later Bamaiyi assured Malu, also a Nigerian, of Nigeria's continued support.  Nigeria provides the bulk of the force's estimated 10,000 men from Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Sierra Leone. Other troops are expected from Benin, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ecomog has said it wants 15,000 men for the period leading up to Liberia's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bamaiyi said the Ecomog High Command had performed well in bringing peace to Liberia. He said that he was very impressed with the performance of all Ecomog officers and men, especially those of the Nigerian contingent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier, Malu affirmed that Ecomog was prepared to ensure a free and fair election in Liberia scheduled for May 30. He said the force was able and willing to deal with any threat to peace in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May's election will last stage of the Abuja Peace Accord, which was signed by all of Liberia's warring factions, to end seven years of civil war that has caused an estimated 15,000 deaths.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Code-named &quot;Joint Combined Exercise Training (JCET '97),&quot; the month-long exercises are the fifth to be held in Ghana.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participating are nine officers and 93 men of the Ghana Armed Forces, and two officers and 10 men of the United States Special Forces, the Green Berets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an opening address on the exercises, Col. Francis Mahama, Commanding Officer of Ghana's First Infantry Brigade, said the soldiers will exchange ideas in land navigation, interdiction and operation raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other aspects of the exercise are battle drills, ambushes, road blocks, platoon-size operations and marksmanship. Mahama said the joint exercises would put the soldiers in good shape for any eventualities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the U.S. Army had been supporting the Ghana Armed Forces and that, hopefully, cordial relations would continue and be of mutual benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Army team leader, Capt. Harry Woodmansee, said the exercise was &quot; once again a great opportunity for us to share experiences and skills with our Ghanaian counterparts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woodmansee, who in 1996 took part in a similar exercise in the in northern Ghana town of Tamale, said such build-up exercises were necessary to instil professional discipline in soldiers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Commanders of the much hailed Southern African peace-keeping training exercise dubbed Operation Blue Hungwe, completed a gruelling 36-hour session Tuesday in United Nations peace-keeping doctrines, command procedures and strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The session held at the Zimbabwe Staff College -- and code-named Exercise Blue Tsuro -- was designed to equip commanders with command and control procedures for multinational operations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are as good and ready for any peacekeeping mission,&quot; said Brig.  Subusiso Moyo of the Zimbabwe National Army after the exercise, which went throughout Monday night till Tuesday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, which is hosting at least 1,500 personnel from the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), has vast experience in peace-keeping operations having served in the abortive U.N. Somali Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has a battalion currently on a U.N. peace-keeping mission in war-ravaged Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj. Gen. Mike Nyambuya, who is the director of Operation Blue Hungwe, was one-time deputy forces commander of U.N. forces in Somalia. Moyo served as chief military personnel officer in the same mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the peace-keeping exercise, jointly sponsored by the British Military Advisory Training Team and the Zimbabwe army at a cost of some 4.5 million zimdollars (409,090 U.S. dollars), is in three phases: exercises Blue Jesa, Tsuro, and Ijuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Operation Blue Jesa is already underway in the eastern district of Nyanga with at least 1,100 troops from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Troops participating in the exercise, which will end April 20, are from Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The joint exercise, Africa's first, will also see the training of troops in drills and mock peace-keeping operations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI - Controversial Kenyan tycoon and Dolphin Group president, Ketan Somaia, failed to appear before that country's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) hearing on tender fraud for the forth time on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia was requested to appear to explain his part in a R34-million tender fraud eight years ago, when a British company which he represented in Kenya failed to deliver police equipment after being paid in full by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legal fraternity in Kenya demanded that Somaia be extradited from his base in Dubai following his earlier three refusals to testify and his alleged use of President Daniel arap Moi's name in vain.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia sparked widespread public debate in South Africa four months ago after he attempted to secure an exclusive monopoly on vast chunks of Mpumalanga's State owned game reserves and other tourism attractions for 50- years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following revelations about the proposed deal's possible consequences in the Mail &amp; Guardian, the central government forced Mpumalanga's Parks Board (MPB) to re-negotiate its secret deal with Dolphin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A revised contract greatly diluted Dolphin's rights, halved the contract period to 25-years and limited Dolphin's activities to just three of the six initial areas targeted by the multi-billion dollar company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliamentary officials in Kenya said on Wednesday that Somaia's failure to appear at the hearing had again delayed the PAC's investigation into the alleged fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Somaia reportedly faxed an apology to the committee just before it convened, the PAC has decided to take steps against Somaia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will meet on Friday to decide what these steps will be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somaia is also facing possible legal action by President Moi's office after he publicly accused both Somaia and MPB chief executive officer, Alan Gray, of &quot;provoking&quot; the presidency by claiming that Moi had written a letter exonerating the tycoon from all dubious business dealings in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray claimed during a TV interview that he had received such a letter from Moi. He used it to argue against reports about Somaia's questionable past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray has consistently refused, however, to produce the letter - at first insisting that he needed Moi's permission but later saying that he needed legal council from Somaia's attorneys before doing anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's High Commissioner to South Africa, Justice Mudavadi, claims to have been rebuffed each time he attempted to contact Gray on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After also being rebuffed on a number of occasions, the M&amp;G has forwarded a request for the letter to the Public Protector, Selby Baqwa's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to Somaia's woes in Kenya is the demand by a group of Kenya's leading attorneys last week, calling for Somaia to be extradited from Dubai where he now lives, to stand trial on fraud charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, both Mpumalanga environmental affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi and MPB chairman, Dr Patrick Maduna also repeatedly refused this week to answer written questions about the financial value of Gray's business deals with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G previously revealed that Gray owns a helicopter charter company and medical rescue company which are both patronised by the MPB without being submitted to tender procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G has also referred these questions to the Public Protector, who confirmed this week that his office would be looking into the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - A Statement by Archbishop Theodore McCarrick, chairman, Committee on International Policy, United States Catholic Conference, April 8, 1997</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turmoil raging in eastern Zaire is having a destabilizing effect on the entire region of Central Africa. We call on our United States government leadership to employ all diplomatic means that will bring about a cease-fire and promote a complete democratization process in order to prevent further loss of life, to bring about regional stability, and to introduce lawful, elected government to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a recent letter to United Nations (UN) Secretary General Kofi Annan, Pope John Paul II said that cooperation between the UN and the Organization of African Unity (O.A.U.) is necessary if representative parties are to bring about conditions for an equitable solution to the interlocking problems which affect the peoples in the Great Lakes region. The recent steps that have been taken by the international community to put together a framework for peace, particularly the recent cease-fire proposal, have been helpful. We believe, however, that bilateral and multilateral negotiation efforts could be more effective if they were coordinated under the auspices of the Special Representative for the UN and the O.A.U., Mohammed Sahnoun, to include regional leadership. Such an arrangement would centralize the efforts of the international community and enhance the movement toward a peaceful settlement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, more attention should be devoted to supporting the legal institutions based on the transitional Constitution and the political common agreements and commitments. This will ensure the timely implementation of the five objectives enumerated in the UN Security Council Resolution 1097: cease- fire, withdrawal of foreign troops, recognition of Zaire s territorial integrity and that of the other adjoining countries, promotion of the electoral process, and an international conference on peace, security and development in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, we believe that the international community should not remain indifferent to the thousands of suffering individuals, many of whom are severely malnourished, traumatized and stricken with diseases. We urge all governments with regional influence to insist that all groups, including the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire (ADFL), allow safe passage to the Zairian displaced persons and the Rwandan refugees in eastern Zaire, so that they may return to their homes in safety and dignity. That many thousands of deaths have resulted from the current refugee crisis underscores the need to provide regional and international relief and peace- keeping institutions with adequate resources to address such emergencies in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We pray for all the people of the Great Lakes Region of Central Africa, most particularly the suffering in Zaire who are displaced and the Rwandan refugees. We also pray that all people of goodwill, on both sides of the conflict, find it within their hearts to create the conditions for a national dialogue and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - STATEMENT BY MR DUMISA NTSEBEZA, HEAD OF THE INVESTIGATION UNIT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johannesburg office of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission received a statement in April last year from a Soweto pensioner who reported that the late Chris Hani had informed her in 1991 that her son had died in a shoot-out in the Eastern Cape in 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In October last year, the Commission was approached by Mr Tokyo Sexwale, Premier of Gauteng, and given information on an investigation carried out by his staff into the fate of four MK cadres, including Mr Sexwale's brother and the person who had been mentioned in the statement received by the TRC in April. Subsequently, in November, Mr Sexwale's father and one other parent made statements to the Commission. As a consequence, we have statements from three of the families involved in the matter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRC investigations have borne out the investigations carried out by Mr Sexwale's family and colleagues. They indicate that two of the cadres died on August 7, 1981, and another two on August 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cadres had been based in the Butterworth/Umtata area but were discovered and attempted to retreat into Lesotho. However, they were stopped at a police roadblock near Elliot on August 7, where two cadres were killed.  Two escaped but were intercepted six days later at Barkly Pass, outside Elliot, and also killed in a shoot-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigations carried out so far indicate that the four were secretly buried on a farm on the Free State side of the Orange River at night. An undertaker, a police reservist at the time, has admitted that he buried the bodies with the help of white Security Police members. The burials took place on the farm of another police reservist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission is at present looking for the bodies. It will not release the names of those cadres who have not yet been named unless bodies are found and positively identified, and until the next-of-kin have been informed. It will also release only limited information until it is certain that whatever it releases will not prejudice a ongoing investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission will give adequate notice of a full news conference once this stage of its investigations has been completed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Mpumalanga's provincial government has ignored requests by national ministers to consult with them before finalising its controversial multi-billion parks deal with the Dubai-based Dolphin Group. The initial 50- year secret deal had to be re-negotiated after the Mail &amp; Guardian revealed that it granted a virtual monopoly of some of South Africa's key tourism attractions to Dolphin before any affected communities had been consulted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The re-negotiated deal diluted Dolphin's commercial rights, halved the contract period to 25-years and limited Dolphin's activities to just three game reserves instead of the original six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The historic town of Pilgrim's Rest and the Manyeleti Game Reserve were also expressly excluded from the new deal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Environmental Affairs deputy minister, Peter Mokaba, told M&amp;G this week that he specifically asked the relevant provincial politicians and Mpumalanga Parks Board (MPB) officials to forward him their policy guidelines for the commercialisation scheme and to also discuss any re-negotiated deal with him before signing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similar requests were, Mokaba said, made by the national Portfolio Committee on Environmental Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But, to date, we have heard nothing. We are still waiting for even a copy of the new deal, never mind policy guidelines or consultation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The non-consultative approach by the MEC and Board is really testing the limits of concurrent powers and governance,&quot; explained Mokaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What worries us is that it appears that the MPB is rushing into this deal because it is afraid it cannot pay its staff salaries. That is not good or even responsible management.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that he was not rejecting the deal &quot;out-of-hand&quot; but was rather concerned that necessary processes hadn't been followed, Mokaba added that both the motivations for the deal and the way in which it had been concluded were &quot;setting bad precedents for similar initiatives in the future&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why all this secrecy? Any government needs clear policies before committing public assets to radical schemes such as this - we haven't seen any such policy,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the financial situation was really that bad at provincial level, more money could have been found nationally. Civil service salaries should never be the motivation for management decisions in this field - the environment should be paramount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, I am still not convinced that we need to go into this deal at all.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mokaba is not the only one still unhappy with the re-negotiated deal.  Mpumalanga's most inclusive rural NGO, the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), accused Environmental Affairs MEC, David Mkhwanazi of attempting to misrepresent its stand-point on the issue this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EJNF's provincial co-ordinator, Thabo Madihlaba, told M&amp;G that Mkhwanazi had attempted to draft a joint press-release implying that EJNF had dropped its opposition to the deal after a meeting with him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I only found out about the press release by chance, when I phoned and a secretary read it to me. It was completely untrue. We did meet, but EJNF at no stage changed its stand-point. In fact, Mkhwanazi pledged that no developments would take place before all land claims on affected reserves had been dealt with,&quot; explained Madihlaba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, for some unexplained reason, he is backing out of his promise to put that pledge into writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that EJNF, which represents 380 community organisations, had had to &quot;battle&quot; for three months to secure the meeting with Mkhwanazi, Madihlaba added that the MEC was also refusing to return calls to discuss the &quot; distorted&quot; press release and the pledge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our representatives and the four delegates from the Land Access Movement of SA travelled hundreds of kilometres to meet with him. We are rural people and this is not cheap. Instead of resolving the problems, his current attitude is undermining our attempts to settle the unease of our communities,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mkhwanazi was consistently unavailable for comment this week and failed to return the M&amp;G's calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the deal attracts new criticism in South Africa, Dolphin Group president, Ketan Somaia's problems back home in Kenya have also snow-balled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Daniel arap Moi accused both him and MPB chief executive, Alan Gray, of &quot;provoking&quot; the presidency by claiming that Moi had written a letter exonerating the tycoon from dubious business dealings in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gray claimed on national TV to have received the letter in January and used it to argue against reports about Somaia's questionable past. Gray has consistently refused, however, to produce the letter - at first insisting that he needed Moi's permission but later saying that he needed legal council from Somaia's attorneys before doing anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's High Commissioner to South Africa, Justice Mudavadi, claims to have been rebuffed each time he attempted to contact Gray on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adding to Somaia's woes is the announcement by Kenya's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) that it has re-issued a summons for Somaia to appear before it on April 14, to explain his part in a R34-million tender fraud. Somaia has ignored three previous requests to testify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following Moi's denial and the PAC summons, a group of Kenya's leading attorneys last week called for the government to extradite Somaia for Dubai where he now lives, to stand trial on fraud charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, both Mkhwanazi and MPB chairman, Dr Patrick Maduna also repeatedly refused this week to answer written questions about the financial value of Gray's business deals with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G previously revealed that Gray owns a helicopter charter company and medical rescue company which are both patronised by the MPB without being submitted to tender procedures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M&amp;G has referred the questions to the Public Protector, Selby Baqwa, with an appeal to assist in obtaining the answers. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pietersburg - On Friday, Northern Province will be the last of South Africa's nine provinces to establish a House of Traditional Leaders after three years of inter-tribal power-wrangling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes just one week before the inauguration of the national Council of Traditional Leaders which will be addressed by President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town next Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesperson for the Northern Province Department of Local Government, Thomas Lekgothoane, said inter-tribal disputes between the majority Pedi group and the minority Venda and Tsonga groups, had prevented the House of Traditional Leaders from being established sooner, due to minority fears that the Pedi would dominate them.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Originally, there were to be six representatives from the six tribal areas, &quot; Lekgothoane explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would have meant that the Pedi would have had 24 represent- atives on the 36-member council, and the Tsonga and Venda a combined representation of 12 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we've solved the problem by deciding on 18 Pedi representatives, and 18 representatives for the Tsonga and Venda peoples,&quot; Lekgothoane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem that needs to be resolved is that of ground-level conflict between members of the South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) and the chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President of Sanco Northern Province, Moses &quot;Saddam&quot; Malemela, said Sanco supported the establishment of the House, but would initiate a meeting with the still-to-be-elected chairman to draw up a &quot;bilateral&quot; memorandum of understanding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The memorandum will minimise tension and prevent the derailing of the development process,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited examples of &quot;tension&quot; where Sanco members in the Moletjie district are to appear in court on charges of intimidation after allegedly attempting to convince an induna to use community money for the Mvula water project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The induna took the money, but hasn't used it, so the project is on hold.  We tried to meet with him, but he refused to talk with us and now some of our members have to go to court,&quot; Malemela explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused another chief of using tribal money to fund Zionist Christ- ian Church meetings, losing the tribe's vehicle and selling the tribe's cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only peaceful route to resolve such crises is to develop a memorandum of understanding,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malemela said Sanco also wanted copies of the House of Traditional Leaders Act to know how it was constituted, as well as to be informed on the findings of the Ralushai Commission which is investigating the authenticity of certain chiefs in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Lebowa bantustan, many chiefs were crowned, some were not really chiefs, but were crowned only to serve the interests of the past regime,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the new dispensation, the people shall govern and, according to traditional culture, the chiefs are only the announcers of the decisions of his subjects,&quot; he said. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The Nelspruit town council denied on Wednesday that intends to privatise its water and waste department, insisting that it only wants to enter into a private-public sector partnership with a private company managing its services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to threats by the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) to stage nationwide marches from May 1 to May 9 in protest against the council's &quot;privatisation&quot; plans, town council spokesperson, Etienne Garnett- Bennett said there had been a communication breakdown between the union's national and local offices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This (public-private sector partnerships) has never been done in South Africa before, which probably explains why the unions are reacting this way,&quot; he explained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said extensive discussions and negotiations had taken place with Samwu's Nelspruit representatives, as well as members of the Independent Municipal Allied Trade Union (Imatu) since October last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the unions had also been asked to select representatives to sit on a committee which would advise the Nelspruit town council as to which bidding company should be awarded the service contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garnett-Bennett refuted reports that the council would announce the winner of the tender on April 30, saying that it was the final date for companies to submit their bids for the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samwu spokesperson, Anna Weekes, said on Wednesday that Samwu regarded public/private partnerships as &quot;an excuse for privatisation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a press release, she accused the Nelspruit town council of planning to award a 30-year contract to an as yet unnamed company.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The truth is that WWSA, a subsidiary of Lyonnaise Des Eaux (who is one of the two main private sector companies currently seeking to control the world's water) is already operating in Fort Beaufort, Stutterheim and Queenstown,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekes warned that should a private company be granted a concession for Nelspruit's water and waste services, not only would employees lose their jobs, but water prices would increase and water quality would drop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Garnett-Bennett said before any company was granted the service contract, it would first have to guarantee the council that it would not retrench personnel transferred during the transaction, and that employment benefits would be the same as offered by the council, or even better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weekes said Samwu demanded a complete moratorium on all major contracts and negotiations between local governments and the private sector, and that all information be made available to the union.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The weeks following Cape Town's celebrated ranking as a shortlisted candidate in the race for the Games have seemed anti-climactic, but deceptively so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there has been none of the fizzle that attended the build-up to the March 7 announcement, it is actually only the character of the frenzy that has changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bid Company's task at this juncture is, on the face of it, a simple one: it must persuade at least 54 members of the International Olympic Committee to vote for Cape Town on September 5.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing else matters quite as much as this imperative, yet there are many ancillary factors which have a bearing on it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The dynamics of persuasion are complex, almost indefinable - especially in the sense that much of the opinion-forming that will occur in the minds of visiting IOC grandees will be based on perception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some perceptions can be anticipated, and countered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among them is the international view of South Africa, and Cape Town, as a crime-ridden society, a view, it must be said, reinforced by a number of recent headlines, not least the one accompanying the report on 52 murders and 81 rapes in the Western Cape over the Easter weekend, or, for that matter, this week's &quot;Troops Into Wartorn Flats&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that bid-related crime initiatives are probably among the most important practical measures to be launched and sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of initiatives, some of which are being launched this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even if crime is not something that will be solved overnight, or before September, it will be vital not just for the bid, but future investment in the region, that these and other initiatives are seen to be efficacious.  Doubting IOC members are more likely to be convinced if Cape Town demonstrates the will and the capacity to tackle crime meaningfully, even if it is in the long-term.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other perception that tends to bedevil particularly European assessments of the South African Olympic project is the view that an African bid - seen, essentially as a Third World exercise - is bound to be inherently deficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is by no means a grave perception, because it is relatively easy to dispel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virtually every visitor from the IOC fraternity so far has gone away favourably impressed with the technical accomplishment of the bid plan, and the depth of understanding that exists in the planning team of the tasks that lie ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's shortlisting in the race for the Games counts, in fact, as recognition of its ability to stage the event, and there are no major doubts about this within the IOC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, presentations to visitors will seek to provide assurances that the Peninsula's transport system will be adequately upgraded, that facilities will be &quot;athlete-friendly&quot; and accessible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about public support?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has always been a hot topic, not least because the anti-bid groupings (who, mostly, represent political fringe interests) will simply not accept the results of independent opinion polls which consistently show support at around 80%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That figure often seems at odds with the expression of opposition in letters columns and elsewhere, but in any debate, vociferous minorities are always noisier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is a view that sentiment has actually changed markedly in Cape Town: where, until a month ago, a lot of people were cool about the Olympics and didn't want the Games in the city, they now like the idea, but doubt our chances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building on that to create a sense of &quot;excitement&quot; about the bid is the task a multiparty group of MPs, headed by half-a-dozen Western Cape ANC politicians, has set itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This spontaneous initiative will clearly do the bid a lot of good in the next few months, but only if the MPs sustain some sort of profile, and make sure that the IOC is aware of their efforts. Visits so far have gone well, by all accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first visitor, Swedish IOC member Gunilla Lindberg, arrived in the city last month for a three-day assessment which, true to the form that is likely to characterise every IOC voter's visit, was low-key.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that the Swedish capital is one of Cape Town's four rivals in this final leg of the race - the others are Athens, Rome and Buenos Aires - would suggest that Ms Lindberg's loyalty would lie with Stockholm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second visitor was Pirjo Haggman, the Finnish IOC member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite Stockholm's being a rival, there are strong fraternal bonds with South Africa in Scandinavia - and indications that Scandinavian IOC members would not automatically vote for Sweden. So these visits are probably more significant than they may seem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bid staffers say that during these visits there has been less emphasis on technical information than on perception-forming. Visitors are treated to an extended helicopter tour of the Peninsula to give them what must amount to an impressive overview of the whole plan. This brings home the developmental nature of the bid plan far better than a formal presentation would. The city is hoping to host as many as 76 IOC members, as well as representatives from international sport federations, between now and August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has become clear is that the debate about whether Cape Town should or should not bid for the Games - the dominant theme of the past year - has been almost entirely overtaken by the project to win the prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, to the extent that the over-arching strategic environmental assessment (SEA) has yet to be completed, the bid is, technically, still on the scales: if, on the basis of the results of the SEA, the public expresses sufficient concern about the environmental, economic or social impact of the Games in an opinion poll to which the specialist consultants running the assessment are committed, the city could find itself in an awkward position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The poll is meant to indicate whether or not the public believes the bid should continue. Practically, though, it is more likely to serve as a planning instrument, an indicator of the kinds of problems that deserve closer or remedial attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the concerns raised during the consultative phase of the SEA - when the consultants sought public guidance on what questions the study should pose - was whether the disadvantaged sector of the economy would really benefit from the Olympic project, as it had been promised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More often than not, detractors trot out the weary argument about the rich getting richer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, only last week, details were announced of an imaginatively recrafted tendering procedure - which will apply to the seven priority projects to be completed by September - specifically to favour small and emergent businesses and contractors from the previously disadvantaged sector.  This gives practical effect to one of the bid's key undertakings, and should go some way to dispel concerns that only the well-off will benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the extent that the outcome in September is incalculable, there is no science to guarantee a winning bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not possible, then, to calculate where Cape Town is lying in the race so far - but there is a sound strategy in place to keep the bid in contention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Hundreds of people eager to lay claim to tons of crayfish lying on the beach at Elands Bay were furious yesterday when they were prevented from doing so by an order from Cape Attorney-General Frank Kahn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said people removing crayfish without a permit would be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is going to waste, why can't we enjoy it? It is not fair and it is not right to me. This is pathetic. It' s a lot of bull,&quot; said an angry Donald Smith, who travelled from Bothasig to try to get his share of the booty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stellenbosch pensioners Charles and Barbara Dinham had to turn back disappointed, missing out on the crayfish after their long drive to Elands Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it's bloody ridiculous,&quot; said Mr Dinham. &quot;If there are thousands of tons of reasonably good food for people, it should be made available to them and the authorities should turn a blind eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We did not come for the crayfish, but to witness the phenomenon. &quot;We were told that it has occurred only once in 30 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief Sea Fisheries marine conservation inspector at Saldanha Bay, Andries Visser, said about 200 tons of crayfish were taken by people at the weekend alone and 200 tons were taken to the Lamberts Bay Fishing Company to be processed into fish meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 50 tons were put into containers and put back into the sea. Mr Visser said that his department would, in conjunction with the police, do everything in its power to carry out the attorney-general's order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kahn said he had been informed that crayfish were still leaving the sea yesterday and people seemed oblivious to the fact that only four crayfish a person a day could be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This situation will not be tolerated and the Sea Fisheries inspectorate has now been instructed to apply the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People removing crayfish from the West Coast area without permits will be prosecuted irrespective of whether the crayfish is dead or alive,&quot; Mr Kahn said. A large contingent of police, army and Sea Fisheries personnel converged on the area yesterday to enforce the regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the lucky ones to get in on the windfall before the ban was slapped on was 20-year-old Elands Bay labourer Nolita Masoyisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;God sent us luck, it's like manna from heaven,&quot; was her view of the 1 000 tons of crayfish that &quot;walked out&quot; of the sea, apparently because of a red tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nolita, who works on a potato farm and lives in a dilapidated shack with her husband Amos, pocketed R500 in three days by selling crayfish to many people who converged on the town eager to cash in on the freak event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Nolita is over the moon about her windfall, the entire West Coast fishing industry is expected to be affected negatively by the walk-out, which will have a serious impact on commercial quotas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fishermen have expressed the fear that after this huge exodus there will be nothing left for them to catch when the crayfish fishing season opens in November.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - More people are killed and injured in motor accidents in the eninsula than by any other violent means. The time is overdue for action to stop the slaughter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call from a concerned public for effective action to contain the growing and mindless slaughter on the Peninsula's roads must be heeded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a little under two generations, the death toll has increased sixfold - from 58 in 1958 to 360 people who died last year in road accidents in Cape Town. In addition, many thousands were injured. Apart from the emotional trauma involved, the costs to the city are enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main reasons for the rapidly increasing accident rate are overcrowded roads, poorly trained and often unlicensed drivers, speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, selfishness and a growing lack of respect for authority in any form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This manifests itself in the way in which many motorists, most frequently the drivers of minibus taxis, flagrantly flaunt the most basic rules of the road by speeding, stopping at will, cutting in on traffic queues and shooting through red traffic lights with impunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost inevitably, when these infractions occur, there is not a traffic officer in sight. He or she usually arrives to re-direct the traffic after an accident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town's new traffic chief, Mark Sangster, has said he intends targeting accident blackspots in the city in an effort to restore order on the roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes, too, in high visibility policing and that this must be accompanied by vigorous enforcement otherwise it has no effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Sangster can take encouragement from international policing trends which indicate that firm action against minor offenders - like those who cross yellow lines - ultimately reduces serious offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He can also be assured that the Traffic Department will have the full support of the law-abiding public of Cape Town for its efforts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - &quot;Stringing&quot; of the upgraded Table Mountain cableway and fitting of the new cable cars is due to start towards the end of June, and this part of the R74-million upgrading programme should be complete by the end of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cableway company managing-director John Harrison said this had presented them with a dilemma - should they start taking passengers up immediately the new cars were in place, or wait for the scheduled re-opening date of October 4, the anniversary of its first opening in 1929?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The company has decided to keep to the original schedule and to use August and September to complete the programme at the upper cable station,&quot; he told journalists during a site visit to the lower cable station yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This means that, by the time we re-open, all the paths will have been done, the restaurant will be finished and all the containers will have been removed. Remember that we've had 120 people living up there. We had a nightmare two weeks ago when we ran out of water at the top - and so the rain this week was very welcome.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the equipment for the new cableway has arrived in Cape Town and most of it - apart from the two new rotating cars, gearboxes and electrical items - is being stored on-site along Tafelberg Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beat Musfeld, the project manager from the Swiss company Garaventa which is supplying the new cableway and supervising its installation, is in Cape Town this week to check progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told journalists the stringing operation would take about six weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A heavy-duty winch would be flown to the top of the mountain by helicopter.  Then, a set of three &quot;ropes&quot; (steel cables), each progressively thicker and heavier than the last, would be hauled to the summit in turn until the fourth and final rope, with a diameter of 488mm and weighing 54 tons, was pulled up.  The first rope - an old machine cable from the previous operation - is already in place. Otherwise, an ordinary cotton rope would have been used as the first &quot;string&quot;, Mr Musfeld said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Swiss project manager is currently also responsible for installing cableways in Albuquerque in the US and St Moritz in Switzerland and his company is the biggest of its kind in the world, with projects in Europe, Canada, US, Korea and Japan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He suggested the round design of the new cable cars, to cope with the problem of wind on Table Mountain, but said this project had presented no other problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And in monetary terms for our company it's about R63-million, which is not a big project,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Harrison acknowledged there had been one &quot;serious&quot; spill from the top cable station when a sand-and-cement slurry had leaked from a catchment area and spilled over the front of the mountain, staining an area about 25m long by three metres wide on the rock face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We treated that as a serious spill,&quot; he said. &quot;We waited until it had dried and then went in and cleaned it off, brushing it and then hosing it down. Our environmental control officer is entirely happy with the result.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Harrison also announced that the issue of removing sewage from the upper station - one of the most controversial aspects of the upgrading - had been resolved in principle to the satisfaction of the Department of Water Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Construction at the lower cable station was difficult because of the city council's insistence that Tafelberg Road remain open to traffic. &quot;It's not an ideal construction site,&quot; Mr Harrison said. &quot;In fact, it's like being in a lion park and being the lion!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my dream that all employees can participate in this listing and, in so doing, participate in the dream of ownership promised in the new South Africa,&quot; Mr Brozin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the group had arranged financing through Standard Bank to help employees buy shares and was also about to embark on an awareness campaign among its 1 750 employees, educating them on their rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nando's is making 10 million shares available to employees compared to the 15 million shares being made available to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said all employees would be able to subscribe for the same number of shares &quot;from management to floor sweepers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to Nando's prospects for the future, Mr Brozin said he saw no reason why Nando's could not become the world's next MacDonalds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nando's already has 38 overseas outlets from Australia to Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brozin believes this could quite easily grow to 400 stores &quot;within the next few years&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nando's is currently looking at expansion in the Pacific Rim countries where Mr Brozin believes there is a huge potential for Nando's brand of spicy chicken dishes and sauces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is a lot of emphasis on Nando's becoming a global brand, the management has not lost sight of its local roots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Brozin believed there was a market for at least 200 Nando's outlets compared to the 102 outlets it currently operates around South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nando's is not really about the chicken, but the Nando's experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For us it's not a business, but rather a way of life,&quot; Mr Brozin said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Trevor Jones sat this week on the stoep of his brother's University Estate home watching the sun rise over the Hottentots Hollands mountains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was almost 30 years since he had last done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The famous film-maker and composer of film music, whose scores for over 60 films include those for Mississippi Burning and In the Name of the Father, sailed for England on May 17, 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was 18 and had just enough money to pay his fees and take up a three- year scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London. Soon after his arrival he told journalists: &quot;I don't think I will ever set foot in South Africa again.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones, who lives in London but whose work frequently takes him to Europe and the United States, said: &quot;I find it very easy to work in New York or Los Angeles or in Paris, because I'm not rooted anywhere ... I just enjoy the places I'm in when I'm there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But in a sense one cannot lose one's roots ... that mountain, that sea ...  the space between ... doesn't change. And intrinsically the people don't change.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What has changed very much for Jones is the place where his home once stood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wept when I saw Black River. I said 'Where's my home? Where's my house?  Where are those orchards? Where are the people?' It's as if the life that I led here in that apartheid system has been totally eradicated - as if that world didn't exist .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the place where his family home once stood is a multi-lane concrete motorway, except for &quot;three trees which were at the bottom of our garden&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones describes how as a five-year-old boy he was captivated by films which offered an escape from the harsh realities of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Film taught me about America and Hollywood ... and it was an escape from the poverty and the restricted environment of my home country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he might not have been aware of it at the time, Jones says he was &quot; a product of what apartheid did to my family, which was incredibly mixed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I had a grandmother from Irish stock with flaming red hair and piercing green eyes, and cousins with dark skins, so we as a family covered a spectrum of races and religions. And still, irrespective of those differences, we were very close.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Throughout my life here the one thing my mother never begrudged me was the thruppence or sixpence I needed to go to the Gem or the Avalon or the Bijou or wherever to see films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And when I played truant from school, during a traumatic period from the age of about five to 12 after my parents were divorced, that was my way of escaping. At the cinema the lighting used for the projector would burn down - either because the projectionist was drunk or had fallen asleep. The image would go but you could still hear the soundtrack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On other occasions the sound system was so bad that it was crack, snap, pop and it would disappear and you would just see the visual image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When you are watching films day after day, which I think I did for at least six months, I felt it almost in a subliminal way ... learning about how soundtrack and image worked ... and I fell in love with film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time Trevor discovered that he had a talent for music. Today he conducts orchestras around the world in addition to writing music for film.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He recalls how, when he was 13, his English teacher at Harold Cressy in Roeland Street asked the class to write essays on what they imagined they would be doing in 20 years' time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I said I was off to conduct the London Symphony Orchestra. And on that day, 20 years later, I was at the Abbey Road studios conducting the London Symphony Orchestra with my mother actually there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Remarkably, most members of that class went on to do what they had said they would in that essay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trevor attributes his and his classmates' success in part to the inspiring teachers they had at school and the solid education they received.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fact that this was at a time when the apartheid system was at its strongest and most vicious also helped in a paradoxical way. &quot;Everything was incredibly constrained and it focused one. We had a situation where people were arrested if they even talked about politics and that sort of climate created a feeling of conspiracy - it was an extraordinary climate to be brought up in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why hasn't Trevor yet made a film about South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think it would be very presumptuous of me when everybody is at this time working so hard at building a new society to come in after 30 years and say 'This is this country'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Somebody will probably beat me to it and will produce some hideous version!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Truth Commission is examining the record of a 1986 State Security Council meeting which appears to show that senior apartheid cabinet ministers, including F W de Klerk, helped form a counter-revolutionary &quot;third force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission chairman Desmond Tutu was commenting today on the revelations in State Security Council minutes leaked this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those at the meeting on May 12, 1986, included former state president De Klerk, who has consistently denied knowledge of such a force, his predecessor P W Botha, and former foreign affairs minister Pik Botha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is nothing new,&quot; said Fanus Schoeman, spokesman for Mr De Klerk. He said Mr De Klerk had admitted the National Party government had considered the possibility of a third force, but after lengthy consideration had decided against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minutes are part of a package of information given to the Truth Commission by Durban lawyer Howard Varney, convener of the Investigation Task Board, which oversaw a unit investigating &quot;third force&quot; killings in KwaZulu Natal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Hundreds of Cape Town's public buildings are potential fire hazards, as more than 80 percent of them do not comply with modern fire safety rules, the city's fire service has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the department was unable to force property owners to safeguard their buildings, said Neville Evans, senior divisional fire prevention officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was because buildings erected before the 1987 national building laws came into effect were not obliged to comply with new fire safety regulations as long as they satisfied the National Buildings and Standards Act of 1962 or a 1972 Cape Town municipal by-law.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've been horrified to see what some of our buildings in town look like inside. Heaven help us if one of them goes up in flames.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Evans urged owners of commercial buildings to put the safety of occupants first and take urgent steps to safeguard their buildings. The onus was on the owner to ensure the safety of a building in the event of fire or any other incident, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately the new regulations could not be made retrospective - thus they affect only those that went up after that date. The structural requirements in those days were not as tough as they are today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fire risk in large office blocks was highlighted by the fire that destroyed most of Munitoria, headquarters of the Pretoria municipality. Mr Evans said fires above the eighth storeys of highrise buildings could not be reached by fire-fighting equipment now available in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buildings more than eight storeys high were therefore a problem for the fire service - there were about 120 in Cape Town, mostly in the city centre and Foreshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fires above eight storeys have to be fought with the help of helicopters.  The city fire service can call several helicopters in an emergency, including those of the air force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New buildings more than 10 storeys high must now be fitted with sprinklers on every floor. This does not apply to office blocks, which are a low risk as they are less likely to contain highly inflammable substances. The Metlife building on the Foreshore was a model fire-safety building, Mr Evans said. It had sprinklers and fire-detection equipment and the fire escapes were well designed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to name the buildings most at risk of fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city's fire prevention officers conducted regular checks on buildings and recommended safety measures, but if a building did not violate safety regulations, owners were not obliged to act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recommendations included installing sprinklers and fire hydrants, which could be costly, as well as fire extinguishers and hose reels, which were fairly cheap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Invariably, when we call for sprinklers to be placed in any building in progress, the owners, architects and designers try to get out of it. They would rather cut down on safety and spend that money on the decor. But you can't talk of expense when it comes to lives,&quot; Mr Evans said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the regulations say they must have sprinklers, that's the bottom line and we do not budge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town's narrow streets caused an access problem for the fire brigade, made worse by illegally parked vehicles blocking entrances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire prevention officers were available to educate occupants of buildings.  But Mr Evans disclosed that Cape Town did not have enough such officers - the 16 on the staff were only half the number required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Five Zambian Journalists' bodies petitioned government Wednesday to withdraw a proposed media council, describing it as a &quot;draconian law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five bodies said they have rejected the government's decision to impose a legislated media council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those who have petitioned government are Press Association of Zambia, Zambia Independent Media Association, Zambia Union of Journalists, Zambia Media Women's Association and the Zambian chapter of the Commonwealth Press Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media council bill launched Tuesday seeks to regulate media organizations. It has introduced compulsory registration of journalists, set qualifications for them and has also instituted a disciplinary body for media practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If instituted by law, the council will have the power to reprimand, suspend or withdraw accreditation to offending journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To practice, journalists must have attained the age of 18, hold of a bachelor of arts degree in mass communication obtained from a university or learning institution recognized by the council. Journalists will also be required to have completed at least two years training in journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after the signing of the petition, journalists reiterated their strong condemnation to the bill which they said would hinder freedom of the press and free flow of information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Media Liaison Committee, Robby Makayi, said that by introducing the bill, government's agenda was to would make the journalism profession criminal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the government definition of a journalist is a degree holder. If not, he has to be a trained person by not less than two years internship,&quot; Makayi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that journalists were committed to a self-regulatory body which was in line with practices in democracies like Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the continent with 37 of the 48 least developed countries in the world, Africa's salvation lies in speedy economic integration, the organizations says in a declaration.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Failure to integrate will lead to an &quot;economic scramble&quot; for Africa by those who have fully integrated their economies, OATUU's secretary-general, Hassan Sunmonu, said in the declaration. The document was presented Wednesday at the on-going O.A.U. Labor and Social Commission meeting in the Ethiopian capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This type of economic scramble will lead to Africa's economic slavery, which we should all resist and avoid at all cost,&quot; he told the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On globalization, he said, &quot;It is not a divine decree,&quot; but a &quot; Frankenstein's monster&quot; that should be fought against when it tries to promote unfair trade rules and investment regimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said as political instability was inimical to economic integration, African workers had stakes in the struggle for peace, stability, democracy and development in their respective countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunmonu cited the upheavals in Algeria, Somalia and the Greater Lakes region that had resulted to deaths, hunger and disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loan, which will begin to attract a 3-percent interest five years from now, is repayable in 18 years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expansion and modernization of the airport has become necessary with growing air traffic to Ethiopia. The facility is the base of the state-owned carrier, Ethiopian Airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, Ethiopia received another loan of 110.5 million dollars from six international institutions for expansion of the airport. One of the five lenders was Badea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time that loan was made, the Ethiopian minister of communications and transport, Abdulmeujid Hussein, said that some 130 million dollars was needed for the project. Ethiopia was to cover 20 million dollars of that sum.  Wednesday's loan leaves a shortfall of 7.5 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work on the airport, which is due to finish in 1998, includes the construction of and renovation of runways, the passenger terminal, and the air control tower.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Africa's top civil servant, Salim Ahmed Salim, appealed Wednesday to two southern African economic bodies, Comesa and Sadc, to resolve their dispute over the duplication of their programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to find a way to ensure the harmonization of the operations which are being undertaken by both Comesa and Sadc for the interest of the two bodies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity -- the continent's foremost political body -- was speaking on arrival at Lusaka International Airport. He is here to attend Thursday's summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Comesa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been an on-going debate on the need for a merger of Comesa and Sadc, the 12-nation Southern African Development Community. Both economic blocs are expected to work toward the economic integration of their members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All but two members of Sadc -- Botswana and South Africa -- also belong to the 20-nation Comesa. But Lesotho and Mozambique have given notice to leave Comesa in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Namibia's Trade and Industry Deputy Minister, Wilfried Emvula, said in Lusaka Tuesday that the country had reversed its earlier intention to withdraw from Comesa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the problems affecting the organization at the time Namibia wanted to withdraw had now been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out the vague relationship between Comesa and Sadc as the main reason that had prompted Namibia to consider reviewing its membership with Comesa, created in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thursday's summit is expected to provide direction so that any confusion in the respective roles of the two regional groupings can be resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said the O.A.U. attached great importance to Comesa, a region of 300 million people, as the pillar to the African economic integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawian President Bakili Muluzi also said Wednesday that Comesa and Sadc needed to cooperate in the implementation of their programs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - Sudan's Popular Defence Forces, a militia of volunteers set up by government to help the regular army fight the Sudan People's Liberation Army, has recaptured an important mid-western location in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a report Wednesday, the government-run daily newspaper, Alsudan Alhadeeith, said that the militia had &quot;managed to purge&quot; the areas of Jabal Abyad, Almur, Jabal A'Awar and the areas of Shamrna, Saraf Addalenj and the Nakar hills of the rebels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no independent confirmation of this claim.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area lies at about 150 kilometres south-east of Delenj, the second largest town in Southern Kurdufan State, mid-western Sudan. It borders war- torn southern Sudan and is part of the eastern Nuba mountains, known in Arabic as Aljibal Alshargiaa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern Kurdufan is largely inhabited by the Nuba people. Since the late 1980s the SPLA has been able to attract many Nubas to their cause and capture wide areas of the primarily agricultural district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper said its reporters had accompanied the militia in their sweep of the area and had seen &quot;more than 200 families, including women, children, elders and youths return to their areas,&quot; following the recapture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It quoted Delenj Province Commissioner Abduljabbar Hussein, who has been in the Jabal Abyad area, as saying that &quot;the sons of the area are determined, through this popular campaign, to free all the citizens held by the outlaws in the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that with the recapture of these areas, he said, some one million acres (404,700 hectares) of agricultural land in Habila and Kerttala will be ready for use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area produces sorghum and sesame and is second in agricultural importance to the vast mechanized farming area of Gedarif in eastern Sudan, thought to be the granary of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Returnees described their confinement in the areas held by the SPLA as like being in &quot;a big prison.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief of the Kawaleeb ethnic group, Hassan Abdallah Miskein, 58, told the newspaper that since 1987 the SPLA never allowed anyone to leave the area under its control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many of our people have been liquidated for trying to escape the area,&quot; Miskein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kawaleep are a branch of the Nuba people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA, Tijani Kalas, said: &quot;used to force citizens to carry ammunition and weapons from their depots in Allir in southern Sudan to the area of Moun, in southern Jurdufan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalas, who is chief of Jabal Abyad, added: &quot;Citizens were forced to walk for a whole month with these heavy loads of big munitions boxes on their heads.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in Taludi, in Southern Kurdufan State, say they have managed to open up the road to Malakal, capital of Upper Nile State, after its closure for 13 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taludi Province Commissioner in Southern Kurduf, Elayyan Ali Mohammed, declared the opening in March of the road linking Kadugli, the state capital, to Taludi to the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These reports of government successes follow claims by the SPLA over the past two weeks that it had taken a string of locations close to the southern city of Juba. Now they claim to be approaching Juba from the west and east.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KINSHASA, Zaire (PANA) - Zairean leader Mobutu Sese Seko has appointed Gen.  Likulia Bolongo as prime minister in a government that is fast losing its grip on power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zairean state television announced this Tuesday as Mobutu moved to replace Prime Minister Ethienne Tshisekedi, who was reappointed to this post April 3 by the High Council of the Republic, the country's parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is Tshisekedi's sixth sacking as prime minister in his long-running battle for power with Mobutu. Tshisekedi had just succeeded Leon Kengo Wa Dondo who was fired March 18 by the transitional parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On assuming power again, Tshisekedi immediately dissolved the parliament which appointed him and appointed new ministers. But he excluded members of Mobutu's party from the new government, calling only on his party and the anti-government Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (Zaire). The alliance rejected the offer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Tshisekedi tried to assume duties Wednesday, under the escort of his supporters, his way to the prime minister's office was barred by government troops. Then, fighting broke out between his supporters and the troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi and his estimated 10,000 party supporters -- of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress -- were dispersed with tear gases. He was wounded slightly on his right arm by grenade fragments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the commander of the 11th military district of Kinshasa, one Gen.  Elese, denied rumors of Tshisekedi's arrest by security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These developments came just hours before reports that the forces of the anti-Mobutu alliance forces entered Lubumbashi on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city, Zaire's second largest and wealthiest, is of strategic importance to central government. The province of Shaba, in which the city is located, is the centre of diamond, copper and cobalt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mobutu declared a state of emergency over two-thirds of the territory still under his control and appointed five military governors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MAKALLE - Ato Gebru Asrat, President of Tigray Regional State, has reaffirmed his government's strong commitment to encourage and support entrepreneurs who invest in the region, as the two-day investment promotion conference successfully wound up there late Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He reiterated that the regional government is determined to do its level best to clear any obstacles which investors may face now or in future. He reminded them none the less not to expect overnight solutions to deep-rooted problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are prepared to tackle problems that you may face, those related to legislation in particular but we don't expect a dramatic change in this regard within a very short period of time,&quot; Ato Gebru said, adding &quot;together we will none the less eventually solve all problems.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Gebru assured the participants that some of the views made and complaints raised in the course of the conference will considered with the context of law making process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the complaints which the investors raised revolved around working procedures in the banks in general and those of the Development Bank of Ethiopia(DBE) and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) in particular.  Several investors claimed that the latter's procedures lack transparency and that corruption and nepotism have almost become their distinctive features, not to mention the &quot;quite revolting&quot; bureaucratic red-tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives of the banks tried to defend their positions. In their views some of the complaints appeared to emanate from simple lack of a clear understanding of the policies of the financial institutions in question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, Ato Gebru said that the banks have the responsibility of elaborating on their policies to their customers so as to avoid such misunderstandings. He described some of the grievances as disregarding the banks' role as profit making enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president stressed, however, that from the complaints reaching his office constantly, he learnt that corruption and red-tape remain pant in these institutions. According to him, complaints related to the banks were too many to have been taken up in the two-day gathering and needed a special forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of participants described the conferences as successful and said that it brought the rich and the policy makers closer together, enabling them freely discuss common interests. Many said that such a practice needs to be part of an ongoing tradition and be emulated by other regional states as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This reporter approached three participants for their views and all expressed utmost satisfaction with the outcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W/t Etenesh Abrha, importer and distributor of medicaments and medical equipment, said that the conference was both educational and informative. &quot;In addition to closely witnessing the progress going on in the region, in Makalle in particular, we learnt that the region is a major reservoir of untapped investment opportunities. It was also an opportune moment for experience sharing between and among investors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to this young entrepreneur, the holding of the conference motivated others to contemplate investing in the region in one sector or other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W/t Etenesh is currently operating a 38-million birr disposable syringe factory project in Addis Ababa due to become operational next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of its kind in the country, the factory will generate employment for 82 people, it was learnt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another participant, Ato Haile-Selassie Kahisay, said that the conference was &quot;simply impressive.&quot; although noting the prevalence of some red-tape in some bureaus, Ato Haile-Selassie is none the less confident that this will be corrected in due course. According to him the very preparation of the forum itself meant a lot to him and others. Ato Haile-Selassie had constructed a 1.  5 billion birr hotel in Hawzen which is now operational. he is also finalizing preparations for launching a 20-million birr hotel project here in Makalle. &quot;In realization of the dire shortage of fuel here, I am on the way to invest on a filling station, too,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A building contractor by profession, engineer Asmelash Hadgu described his very participation in conference as a special privilege, &quot;Everything was impressive,&quot; he stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What impressed engineer Asmelash most was the demarcation of an industrial zone. &quot;With all the necessary infrastructure in place and connected, this is something of spoon-feeding to the investor.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently working in Addis Ababa and Beni Shangul - Gumuz, the engineer said that he was now inspired to expand his firm to Tigrai as well.</SPAN></P>

His article was given prominence both by the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Argus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the article Mr Newton wrongly alleges that the ANC is in the red by R41 million.  This is simply not correct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The basis of this article is a &quot;leaked&quot; information of what the ANC discussed at its Lekgotla of the 19th of January this year. Whilst the figures quoted were correct then, the situation has since improved and the overdraft was made good. Mr Newton gives the impression that it is a crises and a scandal to run a business on an overdraft. He knows that this is not abnormal even for individuals. As such, the intentions of this article are very dubious. Mr Kanhema should at least credit the ANC for not using government and public funds to boost its coffers. Other ruling Parties easily fall into this trap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article also claims that Mr Marcus is a sole director of Freedom Transport. This is different from Mr Newton's earlier allegation that Mr Marcus was the sole OWNER of the company, which we disputed. I am sure Mr Newton knows the difference between ownership and directorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is simply trying to create a scandal. This kind of reporting is not helpful at all. It misinforms the public and seems to have a political agenda.  It must be treated with the contempt it deserves.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The public acrimonious brawl between the minister of Safety and Security and the National Commissioner of the South African Police is a great matter of concern not only to the portfolio committee but to the general public as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is serious given that both the Minister and the Commissioner partly hold the key towards at the least creating a climate for people to go about their daily lives in a secure and safe environment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We had hoped that any misunderstanding and differences between the two will at least end in their boardrooms. We do not wish to point fingers as to who is wrong or right, but we feel that in the interest of our country and people such matters are better dealt with inhouse. Now that the matter is public we have decided to request the Commissioner and the Minister to appear before the portfolio committee and therefore parliament to explain what the problem is. Letters have been sent to both of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We should also point out that we share the Minister's concern about the frequent and continuous piece meal restructuring of the service by the commissioner. We thought and feel that any restructuring that is far reaching should be done once the personnel and resources utilisation plan is in place and after discussion not only in the department but with the Portfolio committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Exposure of the National Party's knowledge of the creation and activities of the third force aimed at destroying the ANC and its allies is nothing knew to the organisation. This exposure has vindicated the ANC's long held conviction that the former National Party government aided and abetted in the creation of a third force</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has always maintained that the creation of a third force and subsequent activities, which undermined even apartheid laws, was never the work of mavericks within government but was sanctioned at the highest levels of the apartheid state.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the heart of the state strategy as confirmed by the documents in possession of the STAR, lay a cold and calculated state sponsored conspiracy to murder, maiming, poisoning , distortions and disinformation against anti- apartheid activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, successive National Party leaders, including FW De Klerk presided over meetings of then State Security Council which had arrogated to itself the right to determine the fate of countless anti-apartheid activists at home and in foreign lands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC calls for members of the former National Party regime including FW De Klerk to come clean with a full disclosure in the interest of reconciliation on their knowledge or otherwise of the creation and subsequent activities of the third force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this context, FW De Klerk's successive submissions to the TRC fell short of the whole truth. De Klerk's continued denials of knowledge of third force activities has been directly contradicted by this exposure and other testimonies during the TRC process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - The first half of this Ethiopian year has seen an unprecedented increase in rape in various parts of the country including the capital, Addis Ababa, police announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;922 women and under aged children in various regional states and 68 others in Addis were raped over the last six months alone,&quot; police told ENA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">some 655 of the victims have reported to police while others did not due to social and cultural influences, police said, adding 370 of those who made compliant are children brutally deflowered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of the victims are aged 16-18, some 19-30 and others are below the age of 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police say 1,653 people have been charged with rape or being an accessory to the crime. Seventy-nine of them are convicted while charges levelled against the remaining are pending court decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crime is committed in most cases individually, and sometimes in group, by those often aged between 19 and 30, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the last Ethiopian year 1,067 women and under-aged children throughout the country had been raped, police reports indicate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related news, certain female students in the capital Addis Ababa disclosed that they are alarmed by the widespread acts of rape as teachers asked for stringent punishment against the culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the opinion of female students, deflowering of under-aged girls and forced sexual intercourse result in study inconvenience and absence from school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lulit Girma, a ninth grade student at the Black Lion Senior Secondary School, told the Ethiopian News Agency that she was saved by her brothers and cousins when gangsters attempted to abduct her at knife point some three years back. Lulit said she was forced then to quit classes for a semester.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haimanot Merid, an 11th grade student of the same school, said many victims of rape desist from divulging the case due to cultural and other social influences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maedot Tesfaye, an 11th grade student of Bole Secondary School, advised female students to wear and decorate decently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weizero Bezuayehu Admasu, headmistress of the Addis Amba Elementary and Junior Secondary School, said rapists have disvirgined a 7 year minor and a 14-year girls students of her school.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - STATEMENT BY MR DUMISA NTSEBEZA, HEAD OF THE INVESTIGATION UNIT OF THE TRUTH AND RECONCILIATION COMMISSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digging at the Aliwal North farm where it is suspected the bodies of MK soldiers were secretly buried in 1981 was suspended this morning when bones, including what appear to be a human femur, spinal cord and ribs, were found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pathologist is being summoned from Bloemfontein and we shall wait for his arrival before we continue with the digging.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until now we have been using mechanical excavators but we have brought in men who will dig more slowly with shovels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Today's discovery was made after we moved to a new location this morning.  We identified the spot after consulting with the policeman who brought the bodies to the farm in 1981, with the undertaker involved and with labourers who knew the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sniffer dogs brought from Durban were used to help find the spot where the bones were found.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC Gauteng Province supports and endorsed the report of the Froneman Commission of inquiry into the violence and occurrences at Eldorado Park, Westbury, Reiger Park and Noordgesig on the 6th February 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC believes that SOWEJOCA, and in particular, Basil Douglas as leader should be held accountable for the unnecessary loss of life, injury to innocent people and senseless damage to property on that day.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flowing from the facts of the report, Basil Douglas is not fit to remain in Public Office and should be dismissed and if necessary, legal action should be taken against him and his organisation by the Attorney General's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC Gauteng Province call on the police service to ensure greater efficiency, gathering of intelligence and planning when faced with such situations. In future police should be better prepared to handle all kinds of protests, including situations where violent outbreaks are predictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure to co-operate between Local Government, Business and Communities will lead to the collapse of our Local Authorities. We therefore call on Local Government, to increase the process of delivery, and business and communities to pay for services rendered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The exhumation of bodies of more ANC cadres including Tokyo Sexwale's brother in Aliwal North today, Thursday 10 April, is only a tip of the iceberg of the many secret graves of ANC and other anti-apartheid activists lying all over South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We salute and dip our banners in memory of these and other ANC cadres who perished in the noble and just cause for a democratic, non-racial and democratic society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The moral and political responsibility for these cold-blooded murders and secret burials of ANC and anti-apartheid activists lies squarely on the shoulders of the National Party regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No amount of denials by respective leaders of the NP including FW De Klerk can convince the public and the international community that apartheid was no crime against humanity in the face of these exhumations, exposures of aiding and abetting in the creation of a third force and other revelations of gross human rights violations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is disheartening to note that NP leader FW De Klerk instead of accepting political responsibility for these acts continues to play hide and seek with the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We demand that leaders of the former National Party government implicated in hatching conspiratorial schemes against anti-apartheid activists in meetings of the State Security Council, break ranks with the past in the interest of reconciliation by providing the TRC with full disclosures of their knowledge of such heinous acts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We call on members of the former security forces who were misused by the National Party government to bolster the repugnant system of apartheid, to come forward and lay bare the truth about:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the disappearance of Stanza Bopape, Egy Mthebula and many anti-apartheid activitis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* train and taxi violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* inter-communal so-called black on black violence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans anxiously await confessions on the disappearances of many of their compatriots. If the National Party is serious about nation building and reconciliation then they will afford families of these victims an opportunity to bury them in honour and dignity by coming clean on all these issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Today marks the Fourth Anniversary of the assassination of Chris Hani, former Member of the ANC National Executive Committee, General Secretary of the South African Communist Party, Commander and Commissar of our erstwhile people's army, Umkhonto we Sizwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On this day, four years ago, the evil forces in South Africa and the world over snuffed out the life of Chris Hani with the hope to destroy the birth of a united, non-racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, only two members of these evil forces are behind bars. The ANC demands that the case of the assassination of Comrade Chris Hani be re-opened.  The new evidence clearly indicates that the assassination of Chris Hani was not just the maverick work of Derby Lewis and Janus Walus. Their network went beyond the borders of South Africa. All those who were involved must be brought to book.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC will do everything to oppose the application for amnesty by these criminals. The new revelations linking directly the apartheid National Party leaders, including former State Presidents, P.W. Botha and F.W. de Klerk, in the formation of the former NP regime's Third Force vindicates what the ANC has always been saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC demands from F.W. de Klerk that he tells the world what did he and his Third Force regime know about the plans to assassinate Chris Hani and all other Third Force activities, including the stoking of political violence in KwaZulu Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the ANC demands that De Klerk resigns from all public positions and completely dismantles the NP regime's Third Force covert network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we mark the assassination of Chris Hani, we take solace in the fact that his death gave South Africa April 27, 1994 as the day for democratic elections which liberated South Africa from the yoke of apartheid colonialism.  His death too shifted the balance of forces irreversibly in favour of the forces of peace, democracy, freedom and prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Hani may rest in peace for the programmes he struggled and died for, The Freedom Charter and the Reconstruction and Development Programme, are being implemented vigorously.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DELMAS - A second young woman has escaped from captivity in the Highveld region of Mpumalanga after allegedly being kidnapped and kept as a sex-slave by taxi drivers, police report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 20-year-old woman, who may not be named, reported to police on Wednesday that she was abducted and forced to have sex with her captors for 29 days before being released by a remorseful taxi driver.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 36-year-old woman, who claimed to have been held as a sex-slave by taxi drivers for six days, escaped from an isolated house near Witbank on Monday when her captors forgot to tie her up after spending the night gang raping her.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provincial police spokesperson, Captain Benjamin Bembe told African Eye News Service on Thursday that the 20-year-old had been abducted by just one taxi driver on March 10, when she attempted to catch a ride in a taxi on the Grobblersdal/ Benoni road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the taxi suddenly left its normal route and the woman protested, the driver pulled out a pistol and ordered her to shut up or she'd be shot,&quot; explained Bembe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She was then driven to a different abandoned house in the bush and tied up with rope - just like in the previous case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The driver then allegedly left the woman alone in the house but would return at odd occasions over the next 29-days and rape her. &quot;Finally, the woman's pleas and assurances that she wouldn't tell anyone after he released her seemed to work and he apologised for keeping her captive,&quot; said Bembe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man then drove the woman to a road near Delmas and gave her R20 for taxi fare before speeding off in his red BMW. The woman was reportedly too shocked to take down the number plate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the previous case, the 36-year-old woman was also kept captive in an abandoned rural house, was tied up with rope and was raped every evening by a group of roughly five taxi drivers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are also investigating a possibly related rape case near Witbank were a woman was dragged into a veld by a taxi driver after she attempted to catch a ride and was raped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman was released immediately after the attack but had to be treated for injuries to her knees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests have been made yet, but police are investigating. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ermelo - Mpumalanga farmworkers will march in Ermelo on Saturday in protest against evictions and harassment by farmers, said ANC spokesperson, Vusi Sibiya on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said &quot;long-suffering&quot; farmworkers would march in support of the Security of Tenure Bill and hand over a memorandum to Mpumalanga MEC for Agriculture, January Masilela, at Wesselton stadium, who would pass the memorandum on to National Minister of Land Affairs, Derek Hanekom.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a shame and disgrace that whilst the face of South Africa is undergoing massive transformation and democratisation, pockets...called farms, remain untouched,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the ANC supported the farmworkers' call for the immediate passing of the Land Tenure Bill.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pietersburg - The South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) in Northern Province supported the establishment of a provincial House of Traditional Leaders, but wanted a joint memorandum of understanding to be drawn up between it and the house, said Sanco president, Moses &quot;Saddam&quot; Malemela, on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Province is the last province in the country to establish a House of Traditional Leaders, which will be inaugurated in Thohoyandou on Friday, after two years of tribal-conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move comes just one week before the inauguration of the National Council of Traditional Leaders which will be addressed by President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town next Friday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malemela believes the memorandum of understanding would &quot;minimise tension and prevent the derailing of the development process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cited examples of &quot;tension&quot; where Sanco members in the Moletjie district are to appear in court on charges of intimidation after allegedly attempting to convince an induna to use community money for the Mvula water project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The induna took the money, but hasn't used it, so the project is on hold.  We tried to meet with him, but he refused to talk with us and now some of our members have to go to court,&quot; Malemela explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also accused another chief of using tribal money to fund Zionist Christian Church meetings, losing the tribe's vehicle and selling the tribe's cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only peaceful route to resolve such crises is to develop a memorandum of understanding,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malemela said Sanco also wanted copies of the House of Traditional Leaders Act to know how it was constituted, as well as to be informed on the findings of the Ralushai Commission which is investigating the authenticity of certain chiefs in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the Lebowa bantustan, many chiefs were crowned, some were not really chiefs, but were crowned only to serve the interests of the past regime,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spokesperson for the Northern Province Department of Local Government, Thomas Lekgothoane said inter-tribal disputes over the past two years between the majority Pedi group and the minority Venda and Tsonga groups had prevented the House of Traditional Leaders from being established sooner, due to minority fears that the Pedi would dominate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Originally, there were to be six representatives from the six tribal areas, &quot; Lekgothoane explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This would have meant that the Pedi would have had 24 represent- atives on the 36-member council, and the Tsonga and Venda a combined representation of 12 members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we've solved the problem by deciding on 18 Pedi presentatives, and 18 representatives for the Tsonga and Venda peoples,&quot; gothoane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Northern Province House of Traditional Leaders will be inaugurated at the Thohoyandou government buildings at 10am on Friday. - African Eye News Service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Traditional leaders in Mpumalanga want the government to grant them additional land to prevent further urbanisation, said chairman of the province's House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Moses Khumalo, on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the opening of the House of Traditional Leaders, Chief Khumalo said tribal subjects were not benefitting from government schemes such as the housing subsidy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We make a strong plea to government to make it possible for the current system of Permission To Occupy (PTOs) to be acceptable, to qualify people for the subsidy,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this is not urgenly addressed, we are concerned that there will be a continued influx of people to urban areas which will create another problem for government,&quot; he warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Khumalo said traditional leaders were still debating the findings of the Steyn Commission last year which recommends traditional leaders receive reduced salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to report that this debate has not been finalised yet,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is hoped the...establishment of the National Council of Traditional Leaders...will help expedite this matter,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also called for the strengthening of the provincial powers of the Department of Constitutional Development, by either establishing a separate office in the province, or placing relevant personnel in the provincial department responsible for traditional affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This will assist in expediting matters affecting traditional leadership from provincial to national level, and vice versa,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Khumalo also called for the clear separation of powers and functions of elected local authorities and traditional leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not against democratic governance as traditional leaders, but would like a mechanism to be jointly and co-operatively worked out between ourselves and government, as to how we should co-exist with the elected local government structures,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his presentation to the Mpumalanga House of Traditional Leaders, Mpumalanga Finance MEC, Jacques Modipane, said beliefs, values and cultures had to be adjusted to the realities of the modern world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have ruefully clung to our culture, values and beliefs, stuck in an era that has long passed us by,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said traditional leaders should not to forget their traditions, but at the same time accept the realities of modern democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must face it, the globalisation of economies is making the nation state obsolete,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added traditional leaders should ensure infrastructure set in place by the government was respected by communities, that they support the drive against crime and that they push for the development of their people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Thursday, the Mpumalanga House of Traditional Leaders elected three representatives to the National Council of Traditional Leaders which will be inaugurated in Cape Town next Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mpumalanga representatives are, Chief Moses Khumalo, King Mayitjha II and King Makhosoke II. - African Eye News Service</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - If your definition of a second-hand store is a run-down building in a dark alley administered by a scrawny-faced old man with gold- plated false teeth and lots of friends in the underworld, think again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Australian Brian Cumins has made it his life's mission to change that perception and he seems to be succeeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian is chairman of Cash Converters International, which has 340 franchised second-hand stores in 17 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One sure way of measuring the success of the stores is the fact that they generate a turnover of 2-billion Australian dollars a year (about R6-billion).  Not bad for a collection of second-hand businesses. The company is also listed on both the London and Australian stock exchanges.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I set out to change the image of second-hand stores and it was very difficult indeed during those initial days. Our stores have to have flair, flavour, presentation and an ambience,&quot; said Brian, who was interviewed at the Mount Nelson Hotel, while visiting the Mother City to attend a Cash Converters international conference here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first store was opened in Western Australia in 1984 and he readily admits that the road to success has been filled with potholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Setting up the first store cost about a million rands,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in a dark, pin-striped suit, he dispels any myths that second-hand dealers are not worthy business people, always trying to get the better of you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe the concept we have developed is universally acceptable as it appeals to nearly all social groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eliminating this jumble sale mentality, the business of Cash Converters is simply the resale of second-hand goods - an alternative department store, specialising in a wide variety of items ranging from TVs and videos, cameras and sporting goods to computers and jewellery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market for second-hand goods is growing rapidly. Previous consumer reluctance to purchase second-hand items is progressively giving way to the realisation of the value for money offered by second-hand goods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is intriguing about Brian Cumins is that he left school at the age of 14, does not possess the Australian equivalent of matric and was bankrupt at the age of 42, when a bakery he owned went under.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would have been enough to get many other people to throw in the towel, but not Brian. He swallowed his pride, packed his belongings and shepherded his family to Perth, Western Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went back to the job he had before opening the bakery, and worked for a bed retailer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As with many things that have happened to Brian in his lifetime, he got into the second-hand goods trade through a combination of good judgment and business instinct. The shop next to the bed retailer was a second-hand store and he began to study its operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One day he bumped into the owner and asked him if he could help out in the business. The result was the birth of the first Cash Converters outlet in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash Converters has never looked back and in 13 years has grown to the extent where it employs more than 3 000 people in worldwide operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even Brian, a multi-millionaire, confesses that he buys some of his personal items from his own stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The watch I'm wearing, I bought from one of my stores,&quot; he tells me proudly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cash Converters ventured into South Africa two years ago, opening a store in Cape Town. It currently owns eight stores in the country, seven of them situated in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian said he had invested in South Africa because he was confident of the country's economic prospects. He called on other international businesses that had adopted a wait and see attitude not to hesitate but to go right ahead and invest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mandela has done an incredible job without bloodshed or economic demise to change the entire country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is quite evident that the feeling of economic development in the financial markets is one of excitement. Business people are confident about the new South Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conferences such as the Mount Nelson one are held every six months in countries where Cash Converters has franchises and this time it was Cape Town's turn to play host.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking at the strategic planning of our businesses as they change in the future. We are also planning to introduce a set of standards for the stores we have,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian is divorced with two daughters. One of his daughters is involved in the family business, as a jewellery valuer for Cash Converters.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Hundreds of people eager to lay claim to tons of crayfish lying on the beach at Elands Bay have been stopped from doing so by the threat of prosecution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ecological catastrophe playing out at Elands Bay has disastrous economic implications for poor West Coast communities who make their living catching crayfish.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why then have the authorities lapsed into traditional South African big stick mode and stopped those communities - and for that matter any ordinary citizen who takes the trouble to drive the long distance to get there - from salvaging what they can before hundreds of tons of good, nourishing food simply rots on the beach?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney-General Frank Kahn has decreed that the full weight of the law will descend on anyone removing the beached crayfish, pointing out that it is illegal to possess more than four at a time and that one needs a permit to do so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is quoting anti-poaching legislation promulgated for the sole purpose of conserving a marine resource. But there is no way the bulk of crayfish ashore at Elands Bay can be regarded as a resource any longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By their own admission Sea Fisheries staff have managed to save only 50 tons and return them sea. Another 200 tons were picked up by the public at the weekend and 200 tons were taken to a processing factory to be turned into fish meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How can conservation legislation be invoked to protect something which is no longer in its natural habitat and is going to die in the sun or be turned into fertiliser or animal feed? And why waste person power turning these people into criminals when there are murderers, rapists and robbers to be caught?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No Mr Kahn, in this case the law is an ass and should be ignored. Many of the people taking the crayfish, be it to sell or feed their families, probably do not have enough bread to eat. For one brief moment in time, let them eat crayfish.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Maitland-based DL Petroleum has been chosen by the giant Elf Aquitaine group as a partner in its bid to break into the automotive lubricants market in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elf Lubricants South Africa, jointly owned by Elf Lubrifiants of France and DL Petroleum, would have start-up capital of up to R20 million, DL Petroleum's Stephen Watson told the Cape Argus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Watson, grandson of the man who founded DL Petroleum in 1937, is managing director of the joint venture.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking at initial capital of R15 million to R20 million,&quot; Mr Watson said. &quot;But we have a five-year plan and this investment is likely to increase substantially .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elf Lubricants South Africa would sell the full range of Elf's automotive products, from monograde and multigrade oils to hi-tech synthetic lubricants and diesels, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the products will be locally sourced. We will purchase the base oils and the additives here, the cans will be locally made and the products will be blended in South Africa under the technical guidance of Elf, to ensure compliance with Elf's standards worldwide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Watson said the joint venture with the French multinational, which nets profits of R5,76 billion a year and employs 95 000 people in more than 100 countries, was &quot;a natural move&quot; for his company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Created by William Ewart Watson 60 years ago as a lubricants importer, DL Petroleum (named after the founders' sons Derrick and Lincoln) blended and sold the Duckhams range of automotive products until Duckhams was taken over by BP, and then continued marketing the range until the 1980s. The company's association with Elf goes back 20 years through the sale of marine lubricants, which are blended in Durban to supply Elf-contracted ships calling at South African harbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Four years ago we were approached by Elf for a feasibility study of the Elf automotive range in South Africa. The study was completed last year and last August the decision was taken to start a joint venture,&quot; Mr Watson said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next move would probably be into industrial lubricants, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Light industrial lubricants would immediately be sold to workshops and the range would be expanded soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elf Lubricants South Africa will also sponsor the Elf Racing team and has started a training programme for kart drivers from the townships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive director of Elf Aquitaine in South Africa Alain Terrenoire said the time had now arrived for a much greater involvement and investment in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We see South Africa as a great base from which to expand our operations, particularly into the southern and sub-Saharan African regions,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The long-awaited contract to undertake a strategic environmental assessment of Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games has been signed by the Olympic Bid Company and a group of consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strategic assessment has been commissioned to provide an independent assessment of the short- and long-term implications of the bid, and is one of the &quot;minimum requirements&quot; negotiated between the company and the environmental sector for environmentalists' participation in the bid process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of the requirements negotiated between the company and the environmentalists is an independent poll to test the opinion of residents of the greater metropolitan region on whether Cape Town should continue its bid to host the Games.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The environmentalists argued that a proper strategic assessment and related environmental impact assessments of all the proposed Olympic sites were essential if residents were to make informed choices about hosting the Games during the poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of their agreement, the poll should be conducted a month after the results of the assessment have been released. The actual mechanism of how the poll is to be conducted has yet to be decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues to be investigated during the strategic environmental assessment include: economic performance; small business opportunities; public finance; public involvement; urban development pattern; transport; nation-building; job creation; price effects; institutional capacity; population growth effects; housing; sport needs; and promoting sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the original programme, the strategic assessment should have been commissioned in February; a draft working report produced by March; a review draft report by April-May; and the final report by the end of May. But the process is way behind schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of March the Wildlife and Environment Society, a key player in the environmental sector, wrote to the bid company saying the completion of the strategic assessment was a priority and asking it to ensure it was given priority funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, not having had an answer, the society wrote again, asking for an urgent response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Recent decisions by city politicians will prevent the full disclosure of the bid company's financial records. This is cause for further concern regarding the funding of the SEA,&quot; the society's letter, signed by its Western Cape conservation ecologist, Marlene Laros, stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bid company's environmental planner, Mary-Jane Morris, told the Cape Argus there was a commitment to a strategic assessment, as stated in the Bid Book which had been handed to the International Olympic Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The SEA was discussed with the Wildlife Society prior to its first letter of March 3 and I explained that there is full commitment by our management team to ensure the SEA is completed,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The bid company has indicated both verbally and in writing its willingness to deal with any questions any environmental organisation may have, and a telephone query would have been appropriate.&quot; A letter of appointment for the consultants had now been signed by chief executive Chris Ball, Ms Morris said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Ball and the company's financial director, Mike Fuller, had been concerned that funds used for the strategic assessment were spent effectively and there had been extensive talks with the consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We went through a comprehensive process of looking at all the work that needs to be done, and it has taken us longer than we would have liked,&quot; Ms Morris conceded.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A big scam, possibly involving millions of rands, has been uncovered in the Cape Town office of the South African Revenue Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the latest in a string of thefts and irregularities exposed at the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week a VAT expert was suspended when it was alleged he had opened a bank account in the name of a fictitious business and was depositing revenue service cheques in it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scam came to light after authorities became suspicious about large amounts of money flowing in and out of the account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A high-ranking source in the revenue service said four other officials were being monitored and their work scrutinised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In February, a senior tax official with about 20 years' service was suspended for allegedly pocketing PAYE payments .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged scam was exposed when her work portfolio was changed. Certain taxpayers' files were taken from her, preventing her from covering her tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official admitted stealing about R60 000 when the irregularities were found, but to date thefts amounting to &quot;well over&quot; R800 000 have been linked to her, according to a well-placed source in the revenue service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraudulent transactions connected to the VAT official suspended last week so far involve only R25 000, but the investigation is at an early stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said the amount could be much higher and that internal investigators were going through files with a &quot;fine- tooth comb&quot; to establish the magnitude of the fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Receiver in Cape Town, Attie Fourie, confirmed that his department was investigating two cases but declined to elaborate. He also declined to identify the suspended officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest investigations follow the arrest last year of a VAT official who allegedly created a fictitious bottling company to steal more than R400 000 of taxpayers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He allegedly ran the scam for at least a year before he was caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have announced that fraud in government departments is a top priority. Late last year a meeting between heads of commercial crime units across the country prompted a more unified approach in the previously fragmented network of investigative units to clamp down more effectively on government fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was proposed that a new agency, the Financial Intelligence Centre, be formed to monitor suspicious banking transactions, in a bid to expose money laundering.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Long lines of cars remained a common sight at filling stations in Lagos on Thursday despite an order by Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, to release gasoline from the National Strategic Reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an on the spot PANA check in Lagos showed that more stations had received supplies by Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha ordered the fuel release as an interim measure to ease a lingering gasoline scarcity that has crippled economic activities in parts of the oil- producing country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Military officials called to try end this embarrassing shortage say Abacha has also directed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to end the shortage promptly. The shortages have been blamed on supply and distribution difficulties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos, Nigeria's economic hub of some six million people, has been in a virtual standstill as a result of the gas scarcity now in its fourth week.  The shortage is spreading to other parts of the country, including Abuja, the nation's capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's chief of defence staff, Maj. Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, held a crisis-management meeting Wednesday in Lagos with the petroleum resources minister, Dan Etete. Other ranking officials of the country's refineries and members of the armed forces and Police Committee on Petroleum Distribution attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigerians deserved a lot better than this,&quot; Abubakar told the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Industry sources in Lagos said part of the problem was that only three of the country's four refineries were functioning, and all at below their installed capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or Opec, has a daily production quota of 1.85 million barrels. Nevertheless, the Nigeria experiences occasional gasoline scarcities, which are attributed to hoarding, smuggling, distribution or maintenance problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the domestic shortage does not always affect exports, which account for some 90 percent of Nigeria's total foreign exchange earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past, government had to import fuel to augment the shortfall in domestic supply. But industry officials said this practice was stopped in December 1996, following public outcry. Energy experts said imports could be an option to ease the current crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commuters have been badly hit, with many commercial vehicles forced off the road by the fuel shortage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the ban on the sale of gasoline in jerry cans or in unauthorized containers, many car owners say the black market is booming. Fuel now sells for up four times the official price.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana (PANA) - The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Ghana says it has begun preparations for the voluntary repatriation of Liberian refugees, so they can take part in May elections designed to return the country to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high commissioner's representative in Accra, Chrysantus Ache, told the Ghana News Agency in Accra on Wednesday that his outfit was playing &quot;a pro- active&quot; role to transport as many refugees as possible to Liberia to vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ache, who has just returned from Liberia, said the U.N. agency held preparatory meetings with the outgoing special representative of the U.N.  Secretary-General, Anthony Nyakyi, the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, the Interim Government, the West African Peace Monitoring Force in Liberian and other facilitators on security and reception for the returnees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting assessed the significance and potential involvement of Liberians living outside their home country in the May 30 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was for this reason, Ache said, that the U.N. agency had decided to work with other agencies to return Liberians home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the elections to be free and fair it is important that as many people as possible, including those living abroad through no fault of theirs, take part in the decision-making process,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. agency has under its care some one million Liberian refugees in five neighboring countries. They fled seven years of civil war in which some 150,000 people were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The host countries for refugees are Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. Ghana has some 17,000 displaced Liberians at two main camps -- Budumburam in the Central region and Sansuli in the Western region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ache said his organization would spend 2.8 million dollars to transport the refugees from Accra to Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far, he said, about 400 Liberian refugees have said they wished to take part in the elections. Voter registration is still in progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those living near the Ivorian border will be transported by road and others by sea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ache said the U.N. agency would ensure that the refugees it transports will disembarked only at the officially marked zones. There will be two of these areas, one in Monrovia and the other in the hinterland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new wave of Liberian refugees arrived in Ghana in May by sea following renewed fighting when the transitional government tried to arrest Gen.  Roosevelt Johnson of the defunct ULIMO-J faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghana government, already burdened with other refugees including those from Togo, was reluctant to accept more. It relented only after U.N. and aid workers, spearheaded by the UNHCR, pledged to take responsibility for their upkeep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based on this pledge, the UNHCR put up new refugee camps and rehabilitated the old ones. When the Liberians go, Ache said, the camps would be put under the care of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These buildings are assets and could be put to effective use by government, &quot; Ache said in reaction to criticism about investment in the camps.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - African leaders agreed here Thursday that member states of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, or Comesa, who failed to pay membership dues to the organization for five years would be expelled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders, at the end of their one-day summit, said defaulting states had made it difficult for Comesa to carry out its activities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing journalists immediately after the end of the summit, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the new chairman of the subregional economic bloc, said that most of the programs which Comesa was undertaking had not been implemented due to lack of money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit was attended by the presidents of Kenya, Namibia, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Also in attendance were the prim ministers of Rwanda and Swaziland, and the Organization of Africa Unity secretary-general, Salim Ahmed Salim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders urged Comesa member-states to resolve any conflicts through the conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms of the O.A.U. and other regional organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders also agreed to undertake consultations with the governments of Mozambique and Lesotho following their decision to leave Comesa. The two countries have given notice to withdraw from the 20-member organization in favor of the Southern African Development Community, also called Sadc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leaders agreed that Comesa and Sadc co-exist as autonomous and complementary institutions. Critics say their tasks were often duplicated, a factor that has led to Mozambique's withdrawal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Leaders of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Comesa, began their summit in Lusaka Thursday calling for an immediate solution to the civil strife that has engulfed a number of their states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of Comesa states among them Burundi, Somalia, Sudan and Zaire are engulfed in civil war in which hundreds of thousands have been killed and displaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the one-day summit, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said leaders should not hide behind the notion of absolute sovereignty because internal conflicts had the potential of destabilizing other states.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need, therefore, to implore our colleagues collectively in the strife- torn countries to open up the political arena so as to allow all and sundry to decide on their future,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the solution to the on-going conflicts in the region, he said, lay in allowing society to choose its leaders freely and for these leaders to practice good government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe said unless peace and stability was achieved in the region, then the efforts by member-states in building a regional economic bloc and uplifting the quality of life of the population would fail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Malawian counterpart, Bikili Muluzi, told the summit that the influx of refugees threatened the security and stability of most countries in the region. The conflicts, he said, had affected market integration since social and political linkages had been broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi reiterated the need for the affected countries to respect the sanctity of human life and keep open all avenues for dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We ourselves must do the best to resolve the problems. We must work hard to maintain and prevail our dignity even if we are poor,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa, he said, should work aggressively for regional integration, as active participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit's theme is on the &quot;gateway to regional economic integration, growth and development into the 21st century.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected to find measures to strengthen the 20-nation organization, following the withdrawal of Lesotho and Mozambique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations (PANA) - The United Nations has said it will reduce its presence in Kinshasa following increasing anti-government demonstrations in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt told correspondents in New York Wednesday that 12 of the 67 U.N. international staff in Kinshasa would leave the city in about two days.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Staff members who are performing less than essential functions at present will be relocated out of the city in the next 24 or 48 hours,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are three from the U.N. Children's Fund, four from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, one from the World Food Program, two from the World Health Organization and two from the U.N. Development Program.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that some donor agencies and some people in the humanitarian community may also be planning to leave the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa has, in the past few days, been rocked by violent protests against President Mobutu Sese Seko's firing of his newly-appointed prime minister, Etienne Tshisekedi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest marked the latest turn in the crisis facing Zaire, where the Alliance of Democratic Forces For the Liberation Congo (Zaire) have captured at least one third of this country of 905,365 square miles, a country in the heart of Africa almost twice the size of Alaska.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels, who captured Lubumbashi, Zaire's second and richest city on Wednesday, have often said they were fighting to end Mobutu's 32-year reign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States, which backed Mobutu throughout the Cold War, said Wednesday that the era of &quot;Mobutuism&quot; was over. However, Washington denied a newspaper report that it had called on the Mobutu, a self styled field marshal, to resign and go into exile.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - With the fall of Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city, and the change of prime ministerial guard in Kinshasa, Africa's media continued to focus on that country, among other issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakar's Le Soleil noted that given Zaire's current situation, the United States has not hesitated to drop its erstwhile ally, President Mobutu Sese Seko. Jumping ship, it said, Washington had switched its support to the anti- Mobutu leader now in control of the country's richest third.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This explains the latent war of influence being waged by Paris and Washington,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, it added, was the reason for talk of a transitional government and holding of free and fair elections.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But is it democratic to push out of power the marshall who has already announced his intention to stand for presidency in the next elections?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another Dakar newspaper, Sud Quotidien, expressed horror at the lack of African reaction to the thousands of refugees emaciated and dying in Zaire's forests, because of the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither heads of state, international organizations, human rights organizations, nor the civil society have mobilized to stop the human tragedy that is taking place in the forests,&quot; it said. &quot;At a time when many Africans have their attention cast elsewhere, Western public opinion is the only one expressing concern, by alerting their governments and demanding that they intervene,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact, what price did we pay for a free Kuwait, devoid of any tutelary influence? Perhaps the African people do not deserve as much?&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinshasa newspapers also commented on their country's plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">L'Avenir was caustic in its comment on the state of emergency declared by Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wondered what Mobutu sought to achieve by extending an already existing state of emergency when it was &quot;evident that the initial measure never prevented Kabila from conquering the North and South Kivu provinces where the military governors only had time to flee head over heels.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By his action, Le Soft said, Mobutu was displaying his determination &quot;to control the war&quot; single-handedly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Turning to the proposal by Congolese President Pascal Lissouba for a face- to-face meeting between Mobutu and Kabila, the paper said Kabila would appreciate the idea since he had been calling for such an encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it said, acceptance of the meeting would depend on the agenda Lissouba proposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If it is a question of going to negotiate Mobutu's departure from power, it is quite absurd to think that Mobutu would attend such a meeting. One does not saw off the branch on which one is sitting,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For its part, the Kampala tri-weekly newspaper, The Crusader, commented on the third anniversary of the Rwandan genocide which in 1994 claimed about a million ethnic Tutsi and moderate Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a situation such as this, everybody must rise up to protect the rights of the endangered group to live and also to punish the perpetrators,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, it stressed, &quot;the issue of genocide should not be left to the Rwanda government to handle or to commemorate. Genocide is a crime against humanity and it should be the responsibility of the so-called international community to halt it or punish those whose hands are tainted with the blood of innocent victims.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper castigated the short-comings of the United Nations tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, and the manner in which Rwandan courts have been proceeding with their trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Arusha trials are too slow, it noted, human rights groups had questioned the hasty manner in which the genocide suspects in Rwanda are being conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important that justice be done so that individuals do not take the law into their own hands to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Therefore, Africa and the rest of the world must help Rwanda come to terms with this horrible legacy,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ideal, it went on, would be for a more efficient and expanded U.N.  tribunal to handle all the cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper cited growing frustration in Rwanda where the Interahamwe are said to be covering their tracks by killing the survivors of genocide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, it said, fears that the broken-down Rwandan judiciary, sending suspects to their deaths without a fair trial and tragic deaths of Hutu trapped between the Zairean rebels and government troops in the east of that country, were sure embers for a larger fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is a scenario that portends cataclysmic pogroms,&quot; it said, as &quot;there are already accusations of reverse genocide&quot; against the Hutu in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And like Sud Quotidien, The Crusader called for action by the governments of the Great Lakes, Africa and the world to &quot;eliminate the ever-present reality and possibility of genocide&quot; in East Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The best honor we can accord to the memory of the million dead is to ensure that we outlaw genocide from our midst and hunt down the perpetrators.  We must not allow any community, be it Hutu, Tutsi or any other socially and politically undesirable group to suffer extermination,&quot; the paper said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shifting focus, The Times of Zambia commented on Thursday's one-day Comesa summit in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nearly 20 years ago, former American ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young lamented that the trouble with African conferences was that they ended up as talking shops because of lack of follow-up action,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because Africans lacked the will to implement their resolutions, it went on, their people &quot;still face growing misery and economic decline.&quot; It added: &quot; Monumental opportunism, contagious lethargy, unjustified fatalism and the dependence syndrome are just as rife and the future as insidious as when Andrew Young made these remarks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, it said, &quot;we hope the Comesa heads of government and representative of members states meeting in Lusaka will not be guilty to past inadequacies and failure to adhere to what they agree to do in pursuit of their cherished goals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Post, also a Lusaka newspaper, called for Comesa to emulate Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that each head of state at the meeting spoke of the need for peace and stability as essential for economic development. However, as regards Comesa member countries, the issue has to be put in the context of the situation on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality of the Comesa member countries does not demonstrate peace and stability as preconditions for development,&quot; it said. &quot;It is like a pastor who preaches the avoidance of sin as the only key to heaven but continues to live in adultery and transgresses the ten commandments without shame.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cited 33 years of stability in Zambia, for example, yet the country was &quot; on the brink of economic and political dislocation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It gave other examples, such as Zaire, saying that in many parts of Africa &quot; peace has only bred and become a cloak for the perpetuation of some of the worst dictatorships the continent has seen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that &quot;virtually in all the Comesa countries peace is working to the advantage of -- not necessarily popular regimes or leaders but -- dishonest leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Crooks in power are preaching peace to wade off genuine rebellions like that of Zairian patriot Laurent-Desire Kabila,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is quite doubtful, therefore, in view of the situation on the ground whether the Comesa program will be enhanced by peace and stability,&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only example of a Comesa leader who does not have a narrow definition of peace is Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uganda leader, it noted, was using the limited peace in Uganda for economic development and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem with Comesa member-states is not really the absence of peace but (the presence of) corruption.&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was, it said, also &quot;lack of vision and managerial acumen among leaders and the fact that their true priority is to stay in power at all costs and not development.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's National Drug Law Enforcement Agency confirmed Friday it was holding the country's internationally renowned and controversial Afro-beat musician, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, for alleged possession of drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's chairman, Maj. Gen. Musa Bamaiyi, told a news conference that Fela and 107 others were arrested Wednesday at his Ikeja residence and nightclub in Lagos for alleged possession of unspecified quantity of Indian hemp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anikulapo-Kuti, also called the Afro-beat King, was in handcuffs when shown to journalist Friday. He is to be prosecuted after investigation to determine his role and those of others arrested with him in the &quot;sale and smoking&quot; of the banned substance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bamaiyi said that, if convicted, Anikulapo-Kuti could forfeit his property to the government. Anti-drug agents arrested him in a similar raid at his home in April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency did not press charges then. Instead, it opted to counsel the musician and his band members under a rehabilitation program to wean them from Indian hemp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bamaiyi charged that Anikulapo-Kuti's &quot;activities had wrecked many lives in the society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bamaiyi said after Anikulapo-Kuti's arrest in 1996, agents visited and counselled him and his workers at home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one year later, Bamaiyi said, there seemed to be no change and many more people were joining the habit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bamaiyi said the 79 male and 28 female suspects arrested along with Anikulapo-Kuti were mainly teenagers, among them a 13-year-old girl. Some of them said they were not members of the band but lived in the neighborhood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, ever defiant, Anikulapo-Kuti said he had smoked hemp for 40 years and that the substance had &quot;medicinal values and helped him to write good music, eat well and sleep well with women.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The frail-looking musician, who has had several brushes with Nigerian authorities, said he was against hard drugs such as opium, heroin, cocaine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he insisted that smoking of hemp, which he calls &quot;natural grass&quot;, was only a misdemeanor that attracted minor punishment and not the forfeiture of property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been arrested several times for offenses ranging from murder to assault and has always managed to come out unscathed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in 1984, he was jailed under a stringent law against currency trafficking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the agency announced the seizure about 2,444 kilograms of substances suspected to be prohibited drugs in the country this year. Some 320 suspects were arrested over the seizures.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agency's director in Tanzania, Irene Lacy, said that the food will come from the country's strategic grain reserve and the sale of maize stocks would stabilize market prices.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DARWENDALE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - An India and a Swed were presented with the International Association of Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT) awards for their outstanding programs. The presentations were made Thursday at a dinner hosted in Darwendale, Zimbabwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basu Nupur of India won the award for excellence for her television film Dry Days in Dobbasunta. The film depicted women living with breast cancer. It spoke of the vital aspects of the disease of which women were keen to learn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing guests, jurist Jai Chandiram said Nupur won out of a field of 98 film entries. She said there were 16 entries for the radio category.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jenny Cole, another jurist from the British Broadcasting Corporation, said the entries reflected the struggles of women in everyday life and touched on aspects that affected all people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entries, she said, displayed skill, talent, good editing and were highly interesting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there were five entries worthy of honorable mention, among them Zimbabwean producer Lynet Mawere's program on rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chandiram recommended that the association's board seek rights to the films &quot;so that for the price of one we can have many programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also suggested that the association search for ways to help co- productions to help &quot;overcome the shortage of funds which many organizations face.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The week-long bi-annual meeting, the organization's 27th, was jointly hosted by this body and the Federation of African Media Women - Zimbabwe. It was the first such event in African and attracted 70 participants from the continent, European and Asian countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association comprises broadcast professionals, and those in related fields, from around the world. It seeks to advance the impact of women professionals in the electronic field, develop women in broadcasting and utilize the professional skills of the members to support women in development. The meeting ended Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . ZAIRE - Complex Emergency, Fact Sheet 10, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, April 10, 1997. Note: The last fact sheet was dated April 8, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background: In mid-October 1996, fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 700,000 Rwandans and 62,000 Burundians to repatriate by the end of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of refugees also fled west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance gaining territory on all fronts. The Alliance now controls approximately one-quarter of Zaire and is steadily advancing towards its next stated goal, Lubumbashi. In the meantime, talks in South Africa between Alliance and Zairian government authorities adjourned on April 8, so that parties could receive further guidance about a ceasefire agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haut-Zaire Province: Approximately 96,000 Rwandan refugees are clustered in three groups along the 125 km rail line west of the Zaire River, south of Kisangani: 57,000 at km 25, 31,000 at km 41, and 8,000 at km 82. Humanitarian agencies have set up therapeutic feeding centers, water sources, medical facilities, and services for unaccompanied children at each site. Relief organizations are concerned about high rates of severe malnutrition, dehydration, and high fever, presumably caused by malaria. The United Nations (U.N.) World Food Program (WFP) is flying food twice daily into Kisangani, and plans to add a third flight. Relief trains carrying 120 metric tons of food and non-food relief commodities run from Kisangani every 2 -3 days and trucks are also delivering food to refugees. WFP has begun food distributions to Zairians whose food supply has been affected by the foraging of refugees, ex-FAR, and Interahamwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) repatriation proposal, approved by the Alliance on April 5, envisions flying the most vulnerable refugees from Kisangani to Goma, where they will be trucked to Gisenyi, Rwanda. Rwandan army soldiers will then screen the refugees at the Nkamira transit center before they are transported home. On April 7, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) began an airlift of approximately 12,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) to Goma and Bukavu, beginning with 57 unaccompanied children. The British Overseas Development Agency is establishing an air logistics cell in Goma and a transportation unit in Kisangani, which will control air, road, and river movements for the repatriation. Humanitarian agencies are working to alleviate fuel shortages in Goma and Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kivu Province: On March 31, UNHCR reported that 20,000 - 30,000 Rwandan refugees emerged at Karuba, 13 km west of Sake. Another 2,500 surfaced at Tongo, west of the former camps of Katale and Kahindo, north of Goma. Once the refugees are screened by Alliance forces, UNHCR trucks them directly to the Rwandan border. Since March 31, 16,244 refugees have repatriated from Karuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasai-Oriental Province: At least 30,000 refugees are moving towards Angola.  They are believed to be the group who fled the Shabunda area camps in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Assistance: On March 14, USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) arrived in the region to help advance relief efforts in eastern Zaire. USAID/DART installed an information officer in Nairobi, a field officer in Goma, and a field officer in Kisangani. On April 9, USAID/DART and UNHCR representatives accompanied the Government of Rwanda's representative for repatriation issues to Kisangani to assess the refugee situation and finalize the repatriation plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seconded two doctors to UNICEF. BHR/OFDA has provided grants to ICRC to assist Zairian IDPs and repatriating Rwandan refugees and to Save the Children/UK for vulnerable Rwandan and Zairian unaccompanied children. The State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration has provided funding to ICRC and to UNHCR for IDPs and refugees in eastern Zaire. Between December and February, BHR's Office of Food for Peace provided roughly 2,500 MT of food to eastern Zaire from the Rwanda Regional Program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Central Executive Committee met in its normal session from the 8 April 1997 to 10 April 1997. The meeting was preceded by a workshop on the September Commission on 7 April 1997. The CEC is the highest decision making structure in-between the National Congresses. A number of decisions were arrived at. Some of those decisions are contained in this statement, others will be released to the press over the week of the 14 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. State Assets Restructuring The CEC received a report on the restructuring of the state assets. Arising out of discussions the following decisions were taken:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">a) Water The CEC expressed its shock and disbelief at the statements attributed various tiers of government that water provision is to be privatised. The CEC unanimously condemned any suggestion or proposal that water should be privatised and provided by private companies on the basis of profit chasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Water is a national resource and an essential support to the livelihood of all our people irrespective of their class differences. Water is amongst the nine essentials which COSATU will never accept privatisation of. As our policy dictates, we are prepared to consider equity partnership when there are compelling reasons including in these sectors. A wholesale privatisation of water is non negotiable and any attempt to force this down our throats will be fiercely resisted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attempts to privatise municipal services will also be resisted. COSATU will raise this issue at the next meeting of the NFA's 6-aside. If our fears are not adequately addressed in this meeting, we will launch a campaign to thwart these ideologically driven agenda's. The CEC has also endorsed the SAMWU campaign which is scheduled to begin on 1 May 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">b) SAA COSATU took note of the reported statements attributed to the Ministers of Transport and Public Enterprises with regards to the wholesale privatisation of SAA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU wishes to put it on record that these statements are not in line with protracted negotiations between government and transport unions and are also out of line with the NFA agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEC expressed its disappointment of this growing tendency and strategy by some Ministers of making public announcements on issues which are in the process of being negotiated and hope to force these announcements as faite compli.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU will be taking up this matter in the NFA 6-aside scheduled for the 21 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">c) Eskom COSATU CEC is fully behind the positions taken by NUM and NUMSA with regard to the restructuring of ESKOM. We reject the positions that have recently been announced by Minister Maduna. We call on communities to support the march planned for 14 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A broad discussion was held on these matters. The CEC reaffirmed its position as decided by the previous CEC which is outlined below: There may be state assets which should never have belonged to the state sector in the first place, whose retention does not benefit the majority of people or helps perpetuated the apartheid divide. These would need to be identified and sold.  As a movement we will need to ensure that workers and community will not suffer as a consequence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others may require the involvement of the private sector (in a limited form) , based on the need for more capital, new technology, enhanced delivery etc.  Where there is a compelling case for such an approach, the Federation would be willing to consider them. In such situation, the state should remain the majority shareholder rather than withdraw from such a sector or activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In pursuit of the need to involve the state in production, new enterprises and sectors need to be established. An example would be in housing and health, where the current system in failing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, as envisaged by COSATU's 1995 Economic Policy Conference and the RDP, where the balance of evidence point to the need for strategic nationalisation, there must be political willingness to follow this route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this way, the debate shall focus on the role of the state in the productive sector rather than its withdrawal. The CEC also identified sectors which should be in the state sector. These are post and telecommunication, electricity, public transport, housing, health, water, state forests, municipal services and education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Employment Standards The CEC evaluated the campaign underway against the fact that there has been no formal negotiations on the Employment Standards since late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU reiterated its position on all the issues currently in dispute.  These are: a). 6 months maternity leave of which at least 4 months must be paid b). 40 hour week which should be phased in, in the next five years. c).  variation which will not lead to the derailment of rights in which a more favourable test shall be used with a tight exemptions procedure through Bargaining Councils. d). 16 years as a threshold to enter in the labour market. e). Sunday Work with retention of the status quo which should be extended to all workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEC decided to intensify the mobilisation and mass action in support of these demands. All COSATU regions will hold regional Shop Steward Councils on the 19-20 April 1997. COSATU CEC calls on all these Shop Steward Councils to adopt programmes and take this campaign to new heights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COSATU CEC has called a special Executive Committee (EXCO) to be held on 18 April 1997. This EXCO will study the Employment Standards Bill which the cabinet will be discussing on the 16 April 1997. Subject to the progress achieved, the Special Exco was given powers to decide whether to continue or suspend the general strike scheduled for 12 May 1997. In the meantime, we are mobilising for the general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Industry Demarcation The CEC discussed its approach to the industry demarcation for the purpose of the collective bargaining as required by the new LRA. The CEC endorsed the principles which should guide our approach to industry demarcation. These principles include the following: 1. Fewer bargaining instead of the current 82 industrial councils. 2. The accommodation of differences within bargaining councils through special schedules for smaller companies, different sectors or &quot;non standard&quot; employment if necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A process of finalising sectors was agreed upon. Our position shall be submitted to NEDLAC on 17 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. CCMA The CEC evaluated progress since after the CCMA was launched.  Arising from these discussions CEC expressed its uneasiness at the increasing case load the CCMA has to deal with. To this effect a research was commissioned to study all cases submitted to CCMA. COSATU wants to check if the increase is as a result of incompetence of union organisers or the decline in the ability of shopstewards and factory managers to resolve mini problems on their own without resorting to referring every small dispute to the CCMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A concern was also raised that the government expenditure cuts was affecting the capacity of the CCMA to deliver and discharge its mandate. The budget of the CCMA is about R20 million for the current year. This budget is well below what the CCMA will require in order to meet the volumes of cases referred to it in terms of the LRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CEC resolved to take this matter up with the relevant Minister and seek to have this reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Politicians and officials in the Western Cape and in central government are at odds over who should take responsibility for the conflict racking the Cape Flats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conflict between vigilantes and gangsters on the Cape Flats has simmered for months, coming to a boil in recent weeks. The recent spate of attacks and counter-attacks has been characterised as a war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the accuracy or otherwise of that description, the conflict has claimed some lives and destroyed others. Some of the victims have apparently been innocents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, another dispute - albeit considerably less bloody - is building between the Western Cape and central governments. A recent manifestation was the barbed exchanges over the Western Cape budget, with the province taking the pointed step of budgeting for a deficit. It claimed the allocation from central government was, in effect, punitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the two conflicts appear to have overlapped. Central government's Justice Minister Dullah Omar and his Safety and Security counterpart Sydney Mufamadi distanced themselves from the Cape Flats violence, saying it should be tackled at provincial level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party - which controls the Western Cape - says central government is in fact vested with the powers to take effective action and accuses it of being reluctant to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Democratic Party says Mr Mufamadi and Police Commissioner George Fivaz must provide adequate police resources to end the conflict and restore peace to Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the people of the Cape Flats continue to hide behind locked doors as the warring parties go about their business. The constitutional niceties of the argument between politicians will be of little interest to them. They will, however, be asking where on earth the effective policing is.  And they may well question whether the same situation would be allowed to develop in, say, Gauteng.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Chicken farmer turned round-the-world sailor Kobus Kotze was understandably looking a little jaded as he recounted the experience of battling the elements in the Southern Ocean.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had just spent 38 days at sea on the fourth leg of the BT Global Challenge and had been up all night helping coax his yacht into his home port of Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his 13 crewmates on Toshiba Wave Warrior had been agonisingly becalmed off Sea Point and had to limp into Table Bay to take third place on the leg from Sydney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet in spite of the endless pounding they had endured and Kotze's tiredness when I spoke to him aboard the yacht just hours after docking at the Waterfront, the 35-year-old from Agter-Paarl still displayed a remarkable enthusiasm for competing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And why did the chicken farmer cross the ocean?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Kotze: &quot;It's been something I've always wanted to do, although I didn't really believe I would get the opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Before all this,&quot; he continues, making a sweeping gesture with his arm at the other two yachts moored alongside, &quot;I'd expanded my business and proved to myself that I could make it. But living in confined spaces with 12 other people has meant I've had to acquire a whole lot of new skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've learnt to relax and enjoy life. I don't really get uptight anymore or let silly irritations get to me. It's been the most wonderful experience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has not all been plain sailing, though: &quot;The fourth leg has been the hardest by far. On the first couple of legs it was a new experience and the excitement of competing overtakes one. During this leg the huge waves and 45- knot-plus winds never give you a chance to recoup and collect your thoughts.  Physically it was very tiring - we were cold and wet and there were times when we didn't get too much sleep.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 13 crews in the 28 0000 nautical mile race are competing in identical 21m steel yachts and sailing &quot;backwards&quot; around the world against the prevailing winds and currents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We encountered a lot of growlers (icebergs about the size of a house) down south and would have a person on watch on the bow looking out for pieces of floating ice. The steel hulls of these boats are just 4mm thick, you know,&quot; he says without elaborating about what the effects of a collision might be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am one of two guys on board who is married and has a family, and I started feeling really homesick out there on this leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've also come to realise that it's a very selfish thing to do - to be away from home for so long. When we come in to port it's me who gets all the glory, but I think it's my wife who really deserves it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adventure started when Kotze met the organisers of the race during the Cape Town stopover of the first Global Challenge in 1993. After a successful interview he was invited to take part in training and qualification off Southampton and Plymouth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Competing has been a costly business, with a fee of over R120 000 to take part, the cost of accommodation in England, flights to England and from stop- over ports back to Cape Town, as well as employing two managers to run the farm while Kotze is away for the estimated duration of a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kotze's short-term ambition is to beat the only other South African competitor - Boris Webber, captain of Courtauld International. &quot;My skipper has assured me that even if we're not first across the finish line in Southampton (his boat is lying second overall) we are going to beat Boris.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kotze will not only be bringing a knapsack of priceless memories home. He also has a stud in his right ear of which he says: &quot;Ja, I did it after we rounded Cape Horn - you pierce the ear which faces the Horn,&quot; he informs me. &quot; It was my sort of contribution to sailing folklore.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Public parking will change dramatically if the Cape Town municipality agrees to a recommendation that it privatise the control of several public squares in its area, including the Grand Parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move, which will operate on a toll parking system similar to the one used at the airport, is part of an effort to curb the steady decline in parking revenue due to meter feeding and vandalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But privatisation will also require the operators to commit themselves to imaginative ways of providing work for informal parking attendants who are currently operating in the Car Watch scheme.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorists parking in these areas will activate a boom when they enter the parking area and pay a cashier at a kiosk when they leave. The idea is that the tariff be reasonable for the first two hours but rise steeply after that to discourage all-day parking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also under investigation is a scheme to hand over public parking areas to restaurant owners at night so they can provide safe, controlled parking for customers after dark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the city council gives the green light for the project, parking entrepreneurs will be invited to tender for the operation of Draper Street, Warwick Street and Newry Street in Claremont, Riebeeck Square in central Cape Town and the Grand Parade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Dolby, deputy city administrator, told the engineering services committee, which has supported the proposal, that the tender call is likely to include a social involvement component to cater for the informal parking attendants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other requirements that parking operators will have to meet is to have a practical system which will earn the council some income but also safeguard short-term parking for people visiting business districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harrington Square will be developed as an all-day parking facility, while parking areas at Hertzog Boulevard, Old Marine Drive, Oswald Pirow, Church Square, Tulbagh Square and Fountain Park in Rondebosch will be converted from pay-and-display to multi-bay parking systems which will use a card system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dunkley Square and Summerly Square areas in Kenilworth will remain pay- and-display.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final approval for the project will have to be given by the full council which meets at the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Dolby believes the new system could be up and running within the next three to four months.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - One of the most ambitious hotel projects to be tackled in Cape Town has been announced by the Inner Cape Investment Corporation, which plans to build a R220-million all-suite sectional title hotel in Mouille Point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gateway's three top-floor penthouses, each with their own pool, come with a cool R10-million price tag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Building on the super-luxury The Gateway will start in October and it is expected to be completed by 1998. The project is the brainchild of Inner Cape executive chairman Jochen Buechel, who was a Johannesburg businessman and restaurant owner before he moved to Cape Town in 1988 and built the Place on the Bay at Camps Bay and the Fairways guest house behind it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In creating The Gateway, I wanted something that was the epitome of good living, as good, if not better, than anything currently available in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It has to be unashamedly upmarket, designed to pamper to the whims of the international first-class tourist and stay in vogue for years to come,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel may be managed by French hotel group La Meridien &quot;which sends the correct signals to the world traveller who will always support resorts or hotels they believe are reliable and well managed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a resort hotel, The Gateway will not have large conference halls, ballrooms or banqueting facilities, but rather the amenities will include a pool deck with heated pool, bar and waterfall and a conservatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Designed for the company Western Seaboard Developments by Colombo Clarke Architects, the nine-floor building will contain 200 suites in one-, two- and three-room configurations, with penthouses on the top floor. Each suite will have its own kitchen or kitchenette and lounge area, depending on its size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suites will be sold for between R480 000 and R1,6 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although at least five other luxury hotels and four popular priced hotels are to be built in the city over the next two years, David Harris, of marketers Seeff Projects, is not concerned about possible overtrading of hotels in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Gateway's position, plus its quality standards, would ensure its success from the day it opened its doors, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Red tide, which has caused thousands of tons of crayfish to walk out of the sea at Elands Bay and other places on the West Coast, has reached Cape Town's northern shore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea Fisheries red tide expert Grant Pitcher said the toxic tide had been observed as far south as Milnerton and Bloubergstrand, and warned people not to eat shellfish collected north of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Test by the department revealed high concentrations of the toxic dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella in the red tide.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Pitcher said this organism was responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The toxin, known as saxitoxin, disrupts normal nerve function and can cause paralysis and death by respiratory failure in two to 24 hours. It affects filter-feeding shellfish such as mussels and oysters, which accumulate the toxin in their tissues,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Pitcher said crayfish were safe to eat provided the liver was not consumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was unlikely the tide would move further south and affect the vast concentrations of crayfish in the Table Bay area or further south at Llandudno and Kommetjie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The oceanography changes considerably the further south one moves,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although crayfish walk-outs along the West Coast north of Cape Columbine were a regular occurrence, the magnitude of the exodus this year had been enormous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But no recorded data exists to indicate crayfish walk-outs south of Cape Columbine,&quot; said Mr Pitcher. He said in late summer and early autumn a phenomenon known as up-boiling occurred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was when the south-easter displaced surface water, allowing the deeper, colder water to well up, bringing with it the toxic plankton found in red tide. Once on the surface in calm, warm conditions, these organisms started reproducing, forming the concentrated bloom which was visible on the water as red tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile mussel farmers in Saldanha Bay were told to suspend harvesting this week when test showed mussels were toxic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of tons of crayfish have walked out of the sea in the Elands Bay area in the past three weeks to escape being trapped in oxygen depleted water caused by red tide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The walkout led to a &quot;red gold rush&quot; by people seeking a share of the bonanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a row has developed over Attorney- General Frank Kahn invoking legislation restricting possession of crayfish and warning that people will be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea Fisheries officials say uncontrolled collection is hampering efforts to save live crayfish and return them to the sea elsewhere along the coast.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria - In the general discussions which took place from 5 to 8 April 1997, and during which the two Zairian delegations i.e. the delegation of the Government of Zaire and that of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) made their presentations on the situation in their country, the following points of convergence emerged:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Though the parties had different points of view on the nature and source of the crisis in Zaire, they agreed on the fact that there were serious issues of political structures and governance which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Both parties agreed on negotiations to bring about a peaceful, political solution to the conflict. This necessitates a complete cessation of hostilities and other measures consistent with the implementation of the UN/OAU Peace Plan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Both parties expressed commitment tot he principles of territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, the unity and sovereignty of Zaire within recognised international borders. They agreed that this was not an issue between them as they both shared this commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The parties underlined the need for fundamental and democratic change in Zaire. In this regard, they concurred on the need for a process of transition leading to transparent, fair and inclusive elections which would be organised and supervised by an independent body and monitored by the International Community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The parties considered that peace and stability, both in Zaire and in other countries in the region were crucial for peace in the region as a whole.  Therefore, it was important to examine ways and means of promoting good inter-state relations in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the delegation of the Zaire: Me Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the delegation of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation Of Congo-Zaire (ADFL): Dr Bizima Karaha, General Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The South African team shrugged off all the adversity during their visit to Brazzaville last week ... until the second half of the match when they finally succumbed to Congo fever</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S only eight o'clock on Sunday morning at the central market in the Patrice Lumumba district of Pointe Noire but already there is an excited buzz among the crowds of people milling through the narrow aisles. A dancing throng follows a troubador playing a wooden pipe and selling tin rattles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As he passes by the crowds sway to his rhythm which spreads like a wave in every direction. Men, women and children join in the eulogies to the Red Devils, Congo's national soccer team who will face South Africa's Bafana Bafana later in the afternoon in a decisive top-of-the-table clash in group three of the African World Cup qualifiers. Everybody seems to be stocking up with food and drink and heading for the stadium. By 11 o'clock, four-and-a- half hours before kick-off, the ground is filled to capacity and the gates are locked.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the medical fraternity Congo fever may be one of the most deadly diseases known to mankind but the fever which gripped Pointe Noire last week seemed equally virulent. It had been evident from the moment Bafana Bafana touched down at the Agostinho Neto airport on Friday afternoon to be greeted by a swarm of half crazed locals whose only words were an incessant tirade of deux, deux, accompanied by V-signs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the supremely confident South Africans the suggestion of a 2-0 scoreline in favour of the home side seemed hopelessly optimistic. But everywhere the team went in Pointe Noire the words deux, deux echoed in their ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general sense of delirium wasn't confined to the man in the street, though. Everything seemed to be possessed. The meticulous arrangements made months in advance by the South African Football Association (Safa) quickly unravelled. Confirmed hotel bookings were anything but firm and Bafana Bafana had to move to another hotel. The media too were out of luck and slept on mattresses on the floor of an office at another hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday afternoon's training session at the city's Franco Anselmi stadium had to be transferred to the hotel grounds after the team bus rolled to a halt in what appeared to be the municipal rubbish dump and Clive Barker refused to even get out to examine the pitch. A group of locals scoffed derisively as the media held their noses and strolled around the grounds. &quot; Pele and Brazil trained here so why can't Bafana Bafana?&quot; they inquired with contempt. &quot;When was that?&quot; &quot;1959,&quot; came the reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly Monsieur Anselmi's little oasis has been on a steady 38-year decline since then. Back at the Palm Beach Hotel there is an air of professionalism about the squad as they go through their paces on the grassy lawns. &quot;Jeff the Chef&quot; comes out to inform the team that supper is ready. He is Southern Sun's group chef who has been loaned to Safa to prepare the food which has been flown to Pointe Noire with the team. Nothing has been left to chance for this game which has been organised like a military invasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday morning the players go for a stroll around the central market.  They are unruffled by the ubiquitous taunts of deux, deux but fail to find the section where snakes, crocodiles, monkeys and seemingly everything else that runs, flys, swims or crawls in the Congo is up for sale. Just as well.  If anything could have unnerved them it would have been this gruesome little corner straight out of &quot;the heart of darkness&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conrad must surely have been thinking of a place like this when he wrote of &quot;the fascination of the abomination&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the afternoon the team went to the infamous Municipal stadium to see if the &quot;mealie field&quot; where they would play the match is really as bad as has been reported. Under International Football Federation (Fifa) rules the visiting side must be allowed to train on the match pitch within 24 hours of the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But as coach Clive Barker and Safa vice-president Danny Jordaan led the players down the tunnel they were met by belligerent soldiers waving AK47s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were no Congolese officials to be found and an argument ensued as the team tried to gain access to the field. Then the &quot;fever&quot; struck again as a disturbed looking soldier with filed down teeth and a manic half-grin cocked his weapon in Jordaan's face and threatened to shoot him. Jordaan stared him down and invited him to shoot, and after what seemed an eternity one of the other soldiers stepped in to cool him down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even this &quot;Mad Max&quot; episode didn't seem to unsettle the players and as a diplomatic row raged on the sidelines they calmly went about their business on the field looking every bit like the African champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An hour-and-a-half before the game on Sunday the players came out of their hotel to board the bus for the stadium and the 40-strong group of supporters who accompanied the team turned into a choir of a thousand voices. The elite Congolese soldiers assigned to escort the team looked on in awe as Shosholoza reverberated around them and Bafana Bafana marched to the bus, chests forward, heads held high and the smell of victory in their nostrils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More psychological warfare awaited at the stadium as Bafana Bafana had to wait outside for 20 minutes before being allowed into their change room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside the ground the juju men strutted around and drums pounded unrelentingly. Congo's President Lissouba arrived to watch his Red Devils for the first time and then the South African charter jet named appropriately, Bafana Bafana, roared overhead as the teams lined up for the national anthems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congolese soldiers harassed the SABC crew interviewing Jordaan before the match but all the intimidatory tactics in the book appear to have had no effect on Neil Tovey and his men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half-time arrives and Bafana Bafana have played the more composed football and are more than holding their own. During the interval a limping, dancing mascot ambles onto the field with &quot;fever&quot; in his eyes. He fools around with a ball and twice he finds the empty net to t omises roar of the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warming up with the other substitutes is Macchembe Youngha-Mouhani, Congo's only established international star who arrived from Germany just six hours before the game. When the second half begins Youngha is on the field and within 20 minutes he has ominously fulfilled the l Despite soaking up all the intimidatory tactics meted out by the of deux, deux.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Bafana Bafana regiments of old the South African team must prove itself in battle before they can truly become men of men. They showed they can play at home when they won the Nations Cup but it is in places like Congo and the World Cup in France where they must now perform if they are really to become a force to be reckoned with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Congolese before the game, when the time came for the &quot;washing of the spears&quot; Bafana Bafana lacked fighting spirit. Congo played with greater resolve and deserved to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the journey to France is by no means over and South Africa mpared to the madness of Zaire. That would be like letting a dose of have everything to play for, another heartless display in three weeks' time when Bafana Bafana play Zaire will certainly spell the end of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunately for Clive Barker and his team the game will not be staged in Kinshasa. The &quot;Congo fever&quot; experienced last weekend would be nothing compared to the madness of Zaire. That would be like letting a dose of full blown Ebola loose on &quot;ibhola lethu&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - FEW people gave Congo much of a chance against Clive Barker's African Champions in last Sunday's crucial world cup qualifier in Pointe Noire. Bafana Bafana were unbeaten in seven games and after holding the seeded Zambians in Lusaka, they were favoured to head the group and book their place in next year's showpiece in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Congo were at the top of group three they were considered to have ridden their luck in grabbing a late winner in Pointe Noire to beat Zambia 1- 0 and then hold Zaire 1-1 in Kinshasa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even their elimination of the once mighty Ivory Coast in the preliminary rounds by a 3-1 aggregate score over two legs failed to impress the cognoscenti.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivory Coast were in transition, they said, and when South Africa went in level at half-time on Sunday looking very comfortable on the bumpy pitch, the pundits seemed to be right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then in the second half Congo's coach David Memy introduced his secret weapon -Macchembe Youngha-Mouhani. Significantly he hadn't played for Congo since the preliminary matches against Ivory Coast, the last time Congo really impressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youngha is the only Congolese player who has established himself in one of Europe's top sides and with his team Fortuna Dusseldorf involved in the relegation battle in the German Bundesliga he felt compelled to stay and help his club side on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did it for my team. I wanted to try and help Fortuna because it was a very important game for us. If we didn't win it is possible we could be relegated to the second division. So I phoned the national team to say I wouldn't be arriving until Sunday,&quot; said Youngha after becoming a national hero with his two-goal salvo against South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youngha's loyalty to Fortuna paid off as they beat fellow strugglers St Pauli 2-0 in a decisive six-point clash. Then he was rushed to the airport to take an overnight flight to Brazzaville before arriving in Pointe Noire at 10.  30 on Sunday morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it seems likely that Memy left Youngha on the bench because he feared he was tired, Youngha disagrees. &quot;I didn't feel tired and to me it's all in the head,&quot; he said. &quot;I always said I was going to play and the coach just played a psychological game by saving me for the second half. I guess you could say it paid off,&quot; he said with a grin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 22-year-old Youngha has only recently established himself in the Fortuna first team and joined them at the beginning of the season after spending a year with Borussia Moenchengladbach where he made only two first- team appearances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He went to Germany at the behest of Congo's former German coach Joachim Fickert and joined third division club Schwarz Weiss Duren.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he is on the verge of becoming a household name as the star player of a team which is now in the driving seat in the race for France '98. &quot;I think we can make it to France now because South Africa was the most difficult hurdle for us and now we are over that. Now we must play well in our next game against Zambia which will also be a difficult game,&quot; said Youngha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the time being Youngha just wants to savour the taste of victory and the satisfaction of settling an old score. &quot;This was the best win of my career and for me it is also a revenge against South Africa for when they beat us in the last World Cup campaign.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - RESPECT is not a concept which the Afrikaner has traditionally handed out with any great generosity to his fellow men. It took the profound dignity of Nelson Mandela, not to mention many years of incarceration, finally to prick the nation's conscience into doing the decent thing. The British Lions have chosen a more direct means of claiming their due twopennyworth of deference. They have made Martin Johnson squad captain and left out Mike Catt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson stands 2m and weighs 113kg. The detail is but part of the story. It is what Johnson represents, as much as what he is, which will make an impact.  He is the bristling, stroppy, physical, cussed face of British rugby. He is the Lions' statement of intent. He is also a throwback, a skulking, beetle- browed reminder of that brutish lot of 1974 who not only won the Test series but destroyed Springbok manhood in the process.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is what Johnson brings to the party. It is not the most sophisticated message to convey but it is an important one. Johnson was not chosen for his oratory, his diplomacy or even his tactical insights. He will not win friends, or woo princesses, by his fine words or rugged looks. But he will influence those who matter, those who sit a few feet apart in either dressing-room, through the honesty of his endeavour and the sturdiness of his stance. And yet his appointment is a gamble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson will operate in unknown territory. He has never captained a national side before and has only a few club games under his skipper's belt.  He will be desperate to make an impression. Too desperate, perhaps. The best thing Johnson could do when he arrives in South Africa is to head for the beach. The season has taken its toll on his beleaguered body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Rowell, the England manager, tells how he gauges the point in the season by the amount of bandage round Johnson's ankle. The more tape, the later in the year it is. Instead Johnson will now be out there leading from the front at every training session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not that Johnson's appointment is a mistake. There was no obvious alternative candidate. It could also be both the making of him and of the tour itself. Sport is not a precise science and it's good to see the selectors making a bold choice. Either Ieuan Evans or Jason Leonard would have been a safer option. They would also have been softer options. At least these selectors are declaring their hand and challenging the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's occasionally volatile temperament is not a worry. Nor is his taciturn demeanour. It matters not a damn whether Johnson is a dab hand at handling the media. Johnson needs only to be articulate on the pitch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only Mike Catt had been given the opportunity. The prime reason the selectors left out the Bath flyhalf is not because they have doubts about his ability, but because the South Africans do too. Catt was born in Port Elizabeth of an English mother. The South Africans figure that if he hadn't come to England in his late teens then he would be no more than a workaday provincial player in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It may be a harsh judgment, but it's out there doing the rounds nonetheless.  The Lions are so anxious not to cede an inch on that critical terrain, the five psychological inches between the ears, that they have overlooked Catt's vastly improved last showing in the Five Nations against Wales. Catt is soiled goods -inconsistent, vulnerable under pressure and known to the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even so, I would have taken him for his versatility. He is also worth investing in as a strike runner and flat passer, one able to launch the wide game which the Lions hope to play. As it is they are hopelessly locked in at fly-half and full-back, two vital positions. The need for a proven goal- kicker has shaped the selectors' thoughts. They would probably hire an air ambulance for the entire trip if it would guarantee Neil Jenkins playing. As it is, the Welsh flyhalf-cum-fullback will not have to prove his match fitness after recovering from a broken arm. Goal-kicking is that important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence the inclusion of Northampton's Paul Grayson, the back-up No 10 to Gregor Townsend, as well as the late acquisition of the kicking coach, Dave Alred. But if Grayson plays, then there is no need for Jenkins, and vice- versa, which means that Grayson will always be paired with Stimpson at full- back, Townsend with Jenkins; so your expansive game is stymied at either No 10 or No 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lions are long on character but less surefooted when it comes to proven performance. This is no slight on the young bucks in the party, the uncapped Leicester centre Will Greenwood, or his club colleague and Irish No 8, 21- year-old Eric Miller. They richly deserve their opportunity. No, the concern is that there are too many players, seven, from the second division as well as an excess, five, from Northampton, a club who have under-achieved this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It makes no sense that Northampton's Matt Dawson is in at scrum-half ahead of Kyran Bracken. Newcastle's rugby league import, John Bentley, owes his place ahead of Adebayo, Logan and Sleightholme, on past rather than present deeds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the pack there ought to have been a place for Gloucester hooker Phil Greening whose mobility and ball-handling would have been an asset on the hard grounds of the veld. Greening, though, may well be getting a quick call if the shoulder of Irish hooker Keith Wood fails to make the grade over the next few weeks. Wood declared himself in great shape on Thursday after his enforced three-month rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tour does not begin for seven weeks yet. The Lions, though, have already made an important move. They've sent their reputation on ahead to ambush any Springbok notions of superiority. One thing is certain. The Lions won't lose the mind games.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Lions squad has its flaws but the team isn't clawless and there is no room for Springbok complacency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOMEHOW, in the next six or seven weeks, this country has to shake off the complacency that is starting to echo around the prospect of the arrival of the British Lions. There is the same almost gloating atmosphere which pervaded the preparations for Willie-John McBride's tourists 23 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are, it is true, the world champions. It is equally evident that, having survived the troughs of beatings in the tri-nation Sanzar series and losing a home series to the All Blacks for the first time in history, Springbok rugby does indeed live, breathe and continue to be a watchword for the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then we believed all this in 1974, conveniently forgetting that the arrogance of the selectors in those years had caused a Springbok side under the great Piet Greyling to bow the knee to a mediocre England side -and it must be admitted the boot of the late Sam Doble -in a one-off Test at Ellis Park just two years earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that the Lions are not vulnerable. Enough has already been said about their apparent weakness at flyhalf and fullback for this not to be true. Equally, it is worthy of mention that the four nations who make up the Lions have struggled to fully come to terms with the speed and fluidity of the expansive southern hemisphere game. But it is a facet that they have worked hard on and the sure footing of the hard South African grounds will flatten this learning curve at an advanced rate of knots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lions also come under rookie captain Martin Johnson, a lock forward not without respect among the veterans of the Springbok squad, but not necessarily a man calculated to strike fear into the hearts of his opponents.  Johnson's contributions will be vital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this, it is essential to examine the record of the last Lions team to visit this country, the 1981 tourists under England's Billy Beaumont. The big man led a tour riddled with injury, which did not particularly help the Lions' cause. Like Johnson, he was a lock. And it could be argued that - despite Beaumont having led England to Five Nations honours -the tourists would have been better served by a strategist who did not have his head buried honestly and honourably in the second row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To a degree, the 3-1 series victory the Springboks rattled out against Beaumont's men was revenge of sorts for the devastation of South African pride wrought by McBride.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And yet it did not tell the full story. The composition of a Lions side has ever been a hotbed of national intrigue and not always representative of the best that the divergent natures of British and Irish temperaments and talents have to offer the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No other side can pick and choose from a very minimum of 60 Test-hardened players; no other set of selectors the luxury of at least four internationals vying for every position. It is, arithmetically at least, a huge advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They seldom manage to get the mix just right. Under the captaincy of Ireland's legendary McBride, they did, swopping players from lock to flank and from fullback to wing to empower a combination that was among the finest sides the game of rugby has ever seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are hints that the selections manager Fran Cotton has insisted on - the omission of Mike Catt and the inclusion of the uncapped Will Greenwood are just two examples -are aimed towards giving this tour a common base with the raw material McBride had at his disposal. And it must not be forgotten that Cotton served in the front row under both McBride and Beaumont. The lessons of both tours serve him as more than ample experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cotton has also plumped -wherever possible -for the hard men who have served their time in the cauldron of rugby league before re-crossing the bridge that has lately been re-opened by the advent of professionalism.  Simply put, the Lions will not arrive with the intention of lying down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Against this background, there is no cause for Springbok complacency. We have more than enough problems of our own. The bastion of strength many believe our game to be is not without some creaky gates. It only takes a fleeting glance at recent Super 12 games to establish that we are vulnerable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Northern Transvaal are a side divided against the administration and on a losing streak, which has led to the senior players being hauled before the executive. Gauteng surrendered home advantage to Wellington and lost their exalted status on top of the Super 12 log, and Natal have beeen unconvincing in their last two outings. And all this before Gauteng and Natal have to travel to Australia and New Zealand as Northerns have already done.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free State have, in patches, shown what is possible, recording a massive 49- 12 win over Otago at Invercagill, but then failing dismally against the ACT Brumbies. It is an apparent pattern of inconsistency that must worry recently installed Springbok coach Carel du Plessis far more than any deficiencies in individual positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Du Plessis has some deep soul-searching and late nights ahead. From his own perspective, he cannot, as one of the disgraced Andre Markgraaff's acolytes, turn completely away from what his seemingly racially bigoted predecessor set in motion. Nor can he hastily abandon some of Markgraaff's less inspired selections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is stuck, very largely, with what he has inherited and the fear is that he will have to grow into the job of a flawed and unstable base, made even more rickety by the interference from on high that is always a part of Springbok team selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given that the bulk of the South African squad will be drawn from the Super 12 provinces, Du Plessis has some sleepless night ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is also the problem of contenders from Western Province having been left out of the Super 12 and playing in the less demanding Nite League for him to focus on. The chasm between the demands of this provincial competition and the intensity of Super 12 is vast and not truly the breeding ground for match readiness against the Lions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On an individual basis, Du Plessis has other problems, which, in many respects, echo those which confront Cotton. A prime case is at fullback. The immaculate Andre Joubert is recovering from injury and not close to resuming his No 15 jersey for Natal. Only the terminally demented would question Joubert's abilities, but you could forgive them some doubts on his match- fitness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Small, who deputised for him in more than adequate fashion in the Sanzar series before his night-clubbing got in the way, is languishing in the Cape out of the hurly burly of Super 12, and the other prime candidate on form, Gavin Lawless, the top points scorer in the competition thus far, was not considered good enough by Markgraaff to be included among the top six fullbacks in this country last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another area where South Africa and the Lions share common cause is at flyhalf. Henry Honiball is the man in the chair and, given our driving style of play, rightly so. But he has no automatic back-up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Cup pivot Joel Stransky lost favour with Markgraaff to such a degree that he joined his sacked captain Francois Pienaar in England, opting to play his rugby for the Leicester Tigers and escape the pressures of a selection panel who regarded his huge talents so lightly. The other prime candidate is Hennie le Roux. But he is a first choice to partner Japie Mulder at centre for the national team, and Du Plessis would doubtless be hesitant about splitting the pair who have meshed so often and so well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, no! Du Plessis cannot afford to take the Lions as just another touring team. In the long term, he has his own job as coach and the looming prospect of defending the World Cup in Wales in 1999 hanging over him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But more immediately, losing the series to Johnson's tourists would mean a massive dent in the ascendancy of South African rugby and, indeed, the game in the whole of the southern hemisphere.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A philosophical Greg Norman returns this week to the Augusta course that broke his heart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BY any of the usual standards applied to this varied life, Greg Norman should have been contemplating his arrival at Augusta in Georgia this week with all the rampant anticipation of a politician approaching his current mistress to ask if she would not mind staying stumm for the next couple of decades at least.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are more obvious claimants to the title of Most Battered Sportsman of 1996, but while the worlds of boxing, horse racing and rugby no doubt have their own, literally bloodied contenders for such a label, there is no doubt that Norman is up there with the best, or worst, of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Golf may not be a life-threatening game except in its more bizarre moments - the sad occasion, when a player trying to navigate the railway line betwixt 5th and 6th holes at Lundin Links in Scotland was killed by a train, springs to mind -but golf can still wound deeply where it hurts most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even a casual glance at Norman's face as he exited last year's US Masters after blowing a six-shot lead to lose to Nick Faldo illustrated how depressed this proud competitor felt at that bleak moment. Yet here he is, 12 months later, still ranked No 1 in the world, still tilting enthusiastically at every windmill in his path.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Can't wait for it to start, mate,&quot; was his considered response recently on being asked how he felt about returning to the scene of the accident. From anyone else that brief statement would have been taken with a containerful of salt but from Norman it has a certain ring of authenticity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Montgomerie, a serious under-achiever himself so far in his quest for one of those dodgy green blazers the champion receives, has no doubt that Norman will approach this Masters with all the old panache still intact. &quot;If it was anyone else but Greg he'd be returning to Augusta with some reluctance and trepidation, but knowing him I'm sure Greg will be relishing the thought.  In fact, he'll turn it to his advantage. The way he'll be thinking will be that if he wins this year what a win that would be.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether that is how it turns out remains to be seen, of course, but what is beyond doubt is that Norman's game, his demeanour, how he handles this Masters, will be picked over like so many chicken bones left overnight in the jackals' enclosure. No one, not even the phenomenal Tiger Woods, is about to be placed more squarely central in the news media's spotlight than Norman; and he knows it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm used to all that stuff by now and, anyway, I'm comfortable with who I am,&quot; he says. &quot;Look, anyone who tries to do anything in life has to accept that some of the time there will be setbacks and that life isn't always fair.  That's how I view the Masters thing last year. I was out the next day looking at a golf course I was building. It's not that I didn't care or that I wasn't very disappointed, but life goes on and I just got on with it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That philosophical approach to the sweaty world of big-time sport always has been part of Norman's armour. In recent years it has been enhanced as he has developed a serious interest in Zen. As he earns vast amounts of money from the Far East it might be construed that it was a commercially astute road to follow, but Norman insists there is more to it than that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That is why his office at his home in Hobe Sound, southern Florida, has walls plastered with Zen sayings, little nuggets of wisdom that he is storing up for the next rainy day. Favourite among them, he tells me, is the one that suggests, &quot;It is the journey that is important, the journey that is the reward&quot;. That was the opening line in a consoling letter he sent to Davis Love after the American three-putted the final green in last year's US Open to shred any chance he had of victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know what it's like to suffer that kind of disappointment and I just wanted Davis to know that I knew, and to tell him that it wasn't the end of the world even if that's how it felt at the time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, his startling capitulation to Faldo last year has not been the end of any part of Norman's exotic life. If anything, he is earning far more money now than he was then thanks to his graceful acceptance of this shocking defeat and to a growing business acumen. For years Norman grafted away as a client of the Mark McCormack sports agency. Together they got considerably richer, but it is since setting up his own 43-strong team and managing his own affairs that Norman's money has risen from merely serious amounts of the folding stuff to simply ridiculous figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admits that a few years ago he would struggle to stay awake during business meetings, but, now he has a taste for the action, he has turned into a bit of a Wall Street shark. &quot;I've got some dear, dear friends on Wall Street now that have helped me out. I pick up the phone and call one of my best buddies and I say, 'Hey, I've got this going on, what do you think?' Then I might jump on my plane and go to New York so my pal can lay out the best scenario possible that he's experienced. It's then my decision after that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That hands-on approach has turned Great White Shark Enterprises Inc into a serious player in the American leisure market. Norman's interests in clothing, course design, clubs and restaurants are producing huge pay-offs, while the Sod Farm he bought recently has developed a type of grass so durable they cannot grow it fast enough to meet the demands of sports stadiums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So he drives in his Ferrari to the course near his home that he owns, where he boards his helicopter to hop down to West Palm Beach to climb into his private jet to fly wherever he desires or needs to visit. A typical itinerary recently took in Florida, Taiwan, Japan, Los Angeles before going on to Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For relaxation during a major business trip like this he tends to play tournament golf, where his appearance fee often outstrips the first prize.  Someone, he says with a grin, has to pay the gas bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet impressive though all this empire building is -like most would-be omnipotents he rationalises it all by saying he is really only trying to set the kids up -none of it will count if he conspires to simultaneously kick himself in the mouth while stabbing himself in the back again at this Masters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly Faldo and Co will be doing their best to prevent the Australian winning the title he now covets more than any other. The exterior challenge Norman faces comes naturally from the usual suspects, from Faldo and the rejuvenated Jose Maria Olazabal, from Woods and Tom Lehman, Phil Mickelson, Freddie Couples and Montgomerie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the main challenge to Norman perhaps comes more from himself and his emotional temperament than anyone else in Georgia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The FATAL ENGLISHMAN: THREE SHORT LIVES by Sebastian Faulks (Vintage, R57,95)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFTER the success of his Great War novel Birdsong, Sebastian Faulks has turned aside from fiction to present, in The Fatal Englishman, a biographical triptych of three young men of apparent brilliance and promise who met early deaths in mysterious and tragic circumstances. The painter Christopher Wood, the airman Richard Hillary, the journalist Jeremy Wolfenden -each rebelled against comfortable English middle-class backgrounds, each fell victim to the peculiar pressures of his era, each generated a romantic myth. But in the raddled 20th century, the heroes came to their ends in complex, self- destructive ways, with their promise, perhaps, already spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Homosexuality was one factor that guided Christopher Wood's footsteps, as it was later to do with Wolfenden. In Paris, where he arrived in 1921 at the age of 19, fired with ambition to be the world's greatest painter, it gave him an entry into the more louche sections of the beau monde and the patronage of a rich Chilean diplomat.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In appearance, he was the quintessential public-school Englishman, more golfer than artist. With the Jermyn Street shirts, however, went a limp, the relic of a protracted illness that had brought him home from Marlborough to be nursed by his mother. Gratitude to her shaped his future; success as a painter would be his way of repaying her devotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Success was slow in coming. Wood saw art as essentially self-expression, a view which, like his figurative technique, was out of place in the Paris of Dada and Surrealism, despite his adoption of some of the tricks of Modernism.  Parisian high society threw him into contact with Picasso, Cocteau and Diaghilev, but the endless round of parties, and long Mediterranean holidays with his patron, constantly interrupted his work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agonised love affairs -heterosexual now -were a further distraction; so, too, was an increasing opium addiction. In England, things were better. He painted with Ben Nicholson at St Ives and they later exhibited together in London and Paris, though with little critical success. Retreating to Brittany, Wood, in one frenzied month, June 1930, produced 40 canvases of startling originality. He returned to England, lunched with his mother at Salisbury and immediately afterwards threw himself under a train.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wood had burnt himself out. Yet to friends such as Winifred Nicholson and Max Jacob, he was a hero who had led a daring life of high endeavour and died to achieve his vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richard Hillary was a hero of a more public kind, a Battle of Britain pilot who was badly burnt when his Spitfire was shot down in the Channel, and achieved national fame with his memoir, The Last Enemy, published in 1942.  The book remains a classic account of the perils and exhilaration of wartime flying, but had a particular impact at the time with its unsparing descriptions of the aftermath of heroism, the plastic surgery that Hillary and others like him underwent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hillary himself saw The Last Enemy as equally an account of his own moral growth, of the abandonment of his pre-war Oxford arrogance and a conversion to a view of the war as a moral crusade. Not everyone was convinced by this, some critics detecting self-admiration in the apparent conversion. The doubts were renewed when the still obviously unfit Hillary bulldozed his way back to flying duties and killed himself and his navigator in a crash. The critic and pacifist John Middleton Murry, in a debunking article, saw Hillary as trapped in a phoney literary role from which the only escape was death; even Hillary's friend Arthur Koestler saw him as conniving, to some extent, in the public expectation of a heroic end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jeremy Wolfenden cuts a shabbier figure, like Wood and Hillary only in a reckless disregard for his own welfare. A brilliant scholar at Eton and Oxford, he was the Daily Telegraph correspondent in Moscow at the height of the cold war, fell victim to KGB blackmail and became a minor spy for the Russians, later doubling for British Intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By a dangerous irony, Wolfenden's open homosexuality threatened, if publicly revealed, to undermine the path-breaking reforms proposed by his father, John Wolfenden, in his 1957 report. In the end, though now married and working in Washington, Wolfenden collapsed under the pressures of his life and drank himself to death. There is a bitter modern flavour to this exemplary tale, but, compared with Wood and Hillary, Wolfenden was no Icarus: he left nothing behind. Brilliant, yes; a victim, of a sort; but what became of the vision thing?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the urge towards romantic self-destruction appears to link these three young Englishmen, Faulks is careful to leave this implicit. Written in clipped, vivid prose, which occasionally lapses into journalese, it hurries the reader past the pitfalls of poignancy and sentiment. The Fatal Englishman is an absorbing account of three lost lives and the eras in which they were spent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IMAGINE a man who is &quot;a broad-shouldered six-foot-four silhouette headed across the tarmac like a panther on the prowl . Focused. Upright. Full of power.&quot; Did I mention that this man spends winters with one wife on a Caribbean island and summers with another in a village in Ghana? This guy's got everything, until summer wife meets winter wife and then comes a hurricane.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Seasons of Beento Blackbird is the first novel by Akosua Busia, the Ghana-born actress who played Nettie in the movie The Color Purple. In this beautifully crafted love story, we meet Solomon Eustace Wilberforce, a children's author who travels the globe in search of tales to weave into his books. In the off-seasons, he holes up in his Harlem apartment to write, under the pseudonym Beento Blackbird.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Solomon is the kind of man any woman could fall in love with. Frankly, I did. His loving is intense, physically and mentally. He appreciates the women down to their bones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two wives are happy to get his attention. Miriam, his Caribbean wife, the midwife who delivered him when she was nine years old, has a ritual for his visits. She sees him on the second night of his return, and their reunion is always signaled by rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His African wife, Ashia's whole family -a small village -comes out to welcome Solomon, and catch up on what's happened between visits. After he's soaked in his wife's company and gathered a fresh supply of stories from the village, he dashes off to New York to write.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each wife knows about the other and accepts the arrangement, but they're not happy. As time wears on, they realise they're paying a price. Solomon must make a decision, and being the extraordinary people they all are, it's one they can all live with. And so can we.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - New soapie The Burning Issue just doesn't wash, says ANDREW WORSDALE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHY are South African sit-coms and soapies so strained and dreadful and boring? My belief is it's because they try to serve as education and as drama, with teaching and issues always taking the upper hand. Apart from the critically acclaimed hit series Soul City, most local drama series are stilted, patronising and just plain badly written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then again, Soul City, which served as an educative piece about health, had lots of juicy melodrama to deal with, like TB, Aids, child abuse and the tangibly sordid stuff of life, particularly sickness and death, that makes for good television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet another example of the awful genre is the new multi-lingual (yet predominantly Pedi) drama series The Burning Issue. It is a maze of topicality, dealing with the spread of current social afflictions from the RDP, affirmative action, the gravy train and housing policies to drug abuse, music stars and lesbianism (no prizes for guessing who Yoyo, the drug- addicted gay girl, pop star character is based on).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Akin in some ways to Generations, it's like a The Black and the Beautiful - an unashamed soapie set in the new South Africa, filled with empowered black elite and corrupt white hangers-on from the former era. Despite its unmitigated tacky melodrama, it's described in SABC press releases as a sit- com, which is closer to the mark if you enjoy laughing at badly made TV programmes. It's laughable from beginning to end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plot revolves around a property developer, Khuduego Khuduego, the managing director of Imagine Projects, who is heading a low-cost housing plan backed by the council. He runs into all kinds of hassles -as a former political prisoner he's accused by others of climbing on the gravy train and running the show on his own. White companies accuse him of being party to &quot; affirmative action's&quot; reverse racism. And there are other boils is his personal life -an affair with his secretary; a desire to have a son to inherit his empire and, worst of all, the aforementioned troublesome daughter -a drug-addicted lesbian pop star who hangs out in Hillbrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everything about it is so on-the-button issue-wise you can see the drama looming ahead of you like a blimp about to explode. Plot points are made through telephone calls and newspapers -one of TV and cinema's cardinal sins - and the dialogue spells out the issues clumsily but in no uncertain terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What's worse is there's no style in the performance or direction. The actors all walk into frame like they have to keep their backs to the scenery, which they do, creeping along the walls like insects. Most of it is done in master shots so the tempo just sits there like a bloated school play. Despite the horrendous tackiness of American soaps like Santa Barbara and The Bold and the Beautiful, they cut between close-ups incessantly, upping the ante of the personal melodrama between their model-cum-actor stars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the laudable intentions of this series in dealing with issues like corruption, the RDP, fat cats getting fatter and homophobia, it's the execution that irks the most. It's like handicap television -all the men are rampantly successful buppies and the women are weak and subservient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Selahle, writer and producer of the show who has made six drama series for the SABC, is a charming man and he's quick to deflect his critics.  &quot;It's lovely when a show creates controversy because that sparks debate ...  It sets tongues wagging ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When confronted about TV shows relying too much on edu-speak and not enough on gossip and melodrama, Selahle says: &quot;The subject matter in this series is intended to stir up debate and if people talk about it then maybe others in high places will do something about corruption and the gravy train, even though my belief is that television should be entertaining -a sort of escapism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, though, is that you want to escape from the TV set when watching this dull lecture. Truly successful soapies like The Bold and the Beautiful and Neighbours thrive on the sordid personal melodramas of people's lives, inevitably twirling up a spiral of coincidences and minor tragedies along the way, but they don't dwell on a socio-political tract. To some extent Egoli is successful in this regard, but for the most part, shows like Generations hit the viewer with an ideological stick that gets in the way of drama. Surely there's a more entertaining way to get the message across.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burning Issue is on SABC2 at 7.30pm on Mondays</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The paintings of Trevor Makhoba, Standard Bank Young Artist award-winner for 1996, display an unusual intensity of vision and execution.  There is no doubt that Makhoba is an accomplished painter, with a sophisticated understanding of both the psychological and aesthetic potential of colour. In this regard, the paintings are often seductive, drawing the viewer into carefully plotted scenarios. But it is clear that pleasuring the viewer with aesthetically pleasing, Utopian images is not what drives this artist's work.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makhoba's themes are clearly centred around an ardent belief that urban, Westernised South African culture is endangering the values and morality rooted in black rural traditions. His subject matter is divided into two distinct parts -that which valorises traditional societies, and that which forms a highly critical commentary of urban life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is in the works that directly address urbanised society that Makhoba's works gain a dark humour and bitter edge that leave no doubt in the viewer's mind that this artist has an axe to grind, particularly with the sexual deviances that he seems to find confined in this context. In It's Dad, Mum, a young girl shamefacedly reveals her pregnancy to her shocked mother - the image works in a combination of the sugar-sweet, childish colours of a child's room and pyjamas -and a dark humour that animates the face of a toy bear to express her father's salaciousness and a complete lack of remorse.  The safety of the childhood home is a myth for this little girl and her innocence is irretrievably lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Hard Blow in Beijing, which refers to the 1995 World Conference for Women, clearly reveals Makhoba's view that it is the erosion of a patriarchal system and the concomitant emasculation of the black male that results in the corruption of sound societal values. The image is of a boxing ring. A triumphant, topless black woman looms over the powerful, but recumbent black male while a topless white woman squats beside him and counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Makhoba clearly lays the blame for the ills of black urbanised society at the feet of permissive, white Western mores, and the work as a whole is pervaded with a strident sexism and racism that fails to be mediated or softened by any mitigating signs. His paintings often have a kind of heavy- handed humour to them, but the humour is just another means to hone his message, and has a bitter edge, seen particularly in Great Temptation in the Garden, A Hard Blow in Beijing and It's Dad, Mom. Viewed on its own Great Temptation in the Garden is a witty and hard-hitting comment on the corrupted communication between people as a result of the social engineering that epitomised apartheid. But read in conjunction with the rest of the works on the show, the statement becomes less ironic and more stridently bitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But finally, what is really irksome about this exhibition is the catalogue commentary written by fellow artist and friend, Paul Sebisi, who bends over backwards to deny the sexist and racist overtones of the work .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sebisi's commentary, by virtue of its tiresome attempt to make Makhoba into &quot;everybody's man&quot;, becomes a kind of apology for the content of the work.  Makhoba is an artist of excellence, his views are there to be interrogated, debated, questioned -this is to be valued, not denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition is on at the Irma Stern gallery in Cape Town</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Do not adjust your set. The image is changing. Maria McCloy on a fresher generation of South African television presenters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">REMEMBER the days when everything on TV, including shows aimed at the younger generation, was hosted by 40-year-olds with matching shirts and cheesy grins? When the music shows were presented by blonde English wannabees and there were no funky women like Vinoliah Mashego in sight? Well, all that had to change at some stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gina Benjamin trains presenters. She thinks today's presenters have the advantage of being exposed to TV all their lives, so are articulate and daring enough to play games with the camera; use an &quot;upfront in your face style&quot; acting as if the camera they're talking to is a person. Her generation was brought up within the stodgy confines of BBC and SABC radio, where the presenter maintained a healthy neutral distance from the viewer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-four-year-old Options presenter Nkensanyi Manganyi is grateful she doesn't have to sit smiling sweetly in a studio week after week reading someone else's lines. Her young director and producers changed the scope of the show through different topics and camera angles; they allow the women to contribute ideas and be themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big World Goes Africa (and Europe) wasn't only a great experience for Isaac Chokwe because he got to travel, but because for the first time he got to have a say in things like camera angles, content and script. He's dedicated to hip-hop and he is animated as he describes the rhyming and breakdancing battles they used to have as kids, how he ended up learning things unconsciously because he wanted to improve his language and poetry skills to beat the other boys -and that's how he feels &quot;edutainment TV&quot; should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the point of Big World was to educate South Africans who think they're not part of Africa; to expel all the inaccurate stereotypes about the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-two-year-old Zam Nkosi is the popular presenter of Selimanthuzi and he's pulled it off best and had fun because he's allowed to be himself. Talk Talk, Shell Road To Fame (watch out for their new presenter TeeKay) and now Selimanthuzi are shows aimed at capturing young audiences and they all benefit from the ad lib situation. To Nkosi, rigid routine kills any sort of vibe a talented presenter may have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously young people know what their peers want to see. So instead of Ms Bouffant Hair in the pastel-coloured studio we have Michelle Constant talking to the camera above her while she lies on a bed; we have Chokwe interviewing regular young people, not officials; we have him rapping while Congolese musicians make the music on the back of a donkey cart. We have Nkosi interviewing the Boom Shakas and Romeo Khumalos of the world and poking around their wardrobes and fridges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But are enough young people in control of TV yet? Nkosi echoes the others: &quot; There are a lot of people at the door, but very few people sitting at the table who have the influence to make decisions.&quot; Inside Info's Nomonde Gongxeka also believes there aren't yet enough shows made by young people who &quot;are in that situation, so can identify with the youth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manganyi says the danger of older people creating shows they think are funky is &quot;pseudo funk&quot;. Even though shows like Options and Top Billing now have younger presenters, she thinks young people are still typecast and squeezed into lime-green and orange outfits, given directions to be hyper- active and smile a lot on a high-tech luminous couch. Gongxeka says that before Inside Info made it on to the screen, people kept telling them young people didn't care about anything serious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zakes Mda, author and TV critic, believes Inside Info &quot;does much more than the adult programmes of that nature ... they're quite daring ...they go out where angels fear to tread in a much more in-depth manner. The production itself is creatively handled, one suspects a boy like (Khalo) Matabane has a hand in that.&quot; It is up to the four young presenters to write their own scripts and links, get ideas, research and shoot their inserts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mda is annoyed with presenters who are &quot;pseudo Americans, who've never been to America&quot;. Chokwe is one presenter some people think is good except for the American accent. His speech is coloured with hip-hop slang, but he says: &quot;I don't sound American, I might here and there, but to me it's normal English.  People say 'It sounds American, it's Model C English' but it's just English.&quot; I can spot his interest in theatre when he imitates all sorts of South African accents and then says: &quot;I don't know what people really want.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sometimes it seems that all one needs to be on TV these days is a &quot;private school accent&quot; and a pretty face. But Chokwe, Manganyi and Nkosi are way more than fine presenters with private school accents. They've been developing their talent in the industry a while. This is Manganyi's second presenting job, but she is an actress -she won a Vita award for her role in Sophiatown, was apparently brilliant in The Coloured Museum and has done TV dramas, movie work like Soweto Green and even a stand-up comedy routine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benjamin says there is a bias towards hiring black people who have private school accents. Gongxeka can vouch for that: &quot;Production houses are very unfair ... if you get someone like me and someone who speaks with a (private school) accent, they'll assume 'oops this person can't speak English properly' instead of considering the persons skills, ideas and creativity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These presenters don't intend sitting around waiting for change. Manganyi and Nkosi formed Big Foot Productions, where they aim to create the kind of sitcoms, roles and talkshows they want to watch. Chokwe is hoping a planned M- Net music show materialises so he can focus on hip-hop -he used to be in groups with people on the local rap Muthaload CD and wants to release an album with his group, Culprit Lab. Nongxeka sees herself in production; she already does research for Inside Info and Siphiwe, a programme for the disabled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - IAN KERKHOF is South Africa's most radical and prolific film- maker. He has been resident in Amsterdam since the mid-Eighties, when he went into exile and worked for the Dutch anti-apartheid movement and South African War Resistance until 1986. Since then he's made over 20 films, all of which push the envelope between art and pornography -dealing, as they do, with sex, violence, fantasy and personal transgression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His latest film, Wasted, has been playing at Cape Town's Labia Theatre for the past few weeks to rapturous acclaim. In Holland it's still showing after being released last October and, apart from playing to critical plaudits at the Rotterdam and Berlin film festivals, has been sold to Belgium, Germany and Japan.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerkhof is possibly best known in South Africa for his featurette Diary of a Yeoville Rapist, which had Matthew Oates, Eric Miyeni and Gustav Geldenhuys battling gamely as a trio of rapists struggling within the nightmare of paranoia that is Yeoville. The film was received with a fair amount of derision and backbiting by locals, but Kerkhof remained undeterred and returned to Holland where he immediately began production on Baby Kain, a documentary about the Harlem poet Kain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly his best film to date is Ten Monologues from the Lives of the Serial Killers. Made in 1994, it's an infinitely unsettling probe into the minds of murderers ranging from Charles Manson to Ted Bundy with various contributions from rappers the Ghetto Boys and novelist JG Ballard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pierre Klossowski, author of Sade mon Prochain, a seminal work about the Marquis de Sade, and Georges Bataille, sexual philosopher and author of Story of the Eye, are Kerkhof's main role models and sources of inspiration. The Dead Man II: Return of the Dead Man, a 26-minute film made in 1994, is arguably his most shocking film so far, lending terrifying ideas and imagery from his inspired and transgressive mentors. It takes place in a bar in hell and is a visionary take on a man literally going out of his mind. It ends with the protagonist caught in a car between the rollers of a car wash while a couple have sex in the front seat. This was four years before David Cronenberg made Crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerkhof's latest, Wasted or Naar de Klote!, is his most commercial effort to date. Running at a respectable feature length of 91 minutes, it's the tale of a young girl who innocently sells Ecstasy to her friends on the rave scene.  Along the way she becomes entangled with a DJ, resulting in sexual jealousy and inevitable violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climax of the film, where a crowd of ravers takes revenge on a drug dealer's car and takes anarchy out on to the streets, has been criticised in some quarters as not reflecting Ecstasy and rave culture's lovey-dovey experience -but it's nonetheless fabulously cinematic. Shot on digital video, the film was blown up to 35mm and the effect is truly trancey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasted is produced by Dennis Wigman and Kees Kesander, brave Dutch film- makers who are also responsible for Peter Greenaway's outlandish films. When released in Amsterdam it immediately shot to number one, sweeping Independence Day off its moorings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Dutch producers and movie-goers have the artistic courage to tackle the unusual, it appears that South Africans are still more comfortable with the likes of Independence Day. Local independent cinema, the Labia, bought the rights to Wasted late last year. They also own the rights to Greenaway's latest erotic opus The Pillow Book and Jacques Demy's exquisitely lyrical masterpiece The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. The tragic irony is that monopolistic distributor Ster Kinekor has passed on all three of the films, so with no viable independent cinemas in the country other than the Labia, cinemagoers in Cape Town are the few who'll enjoy these celluloid pleasures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wasted is one of the titles featured on the Marginal South African Cinema festival at The Labia in Cape Town. Next up: Andrew Worsdale's Shot Down, Richard Stanley's Dust Devil, Cedric Sundstrom's The Shadowed Mind and John Parr's Night Slave</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THERE'S a crop of South African jazz releases, distributed by indie Sheer Sounds, this month. Paul Hanmer's Trains To Taung is the pick, and not just because of the super-stylish liner notes printed on Chinese funeral money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pianist Hanmer has taken a very different approach to creating an African sound here, focusing on process, cyclical repetition and constantly changing texture, rather than noisy percussion and other Afro-clich's. Melodically, the compositions are slight -sometimes there's barely enough to whistle - minor-key and, on first hearing, fairly Western in a David Benoit-ish way.  But then Hanmer's percussive left hand, Louis Mhlanga's chiming guitar and Jethro Shasha's wonderfully subtle drums spin them out into the kind of stuff you might hear in a San song-circle under Kalahari stars. It's too soon to start calling album of the year, but this will certainly be a contender.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another -except how do you find a category for a fusion that transcends genres? -is the Bruce Cassidy/Pops Mohamed collaboration Timeless. The album doesn't have the unexpected magic of the duo live, nor does it go quite so far &quot;out&quot;, but it comes close. For the uninitiated, Timeless combines Cassidy on some trumpet but more EVI with Mohamed's fresh and iconoclastic take on a dozen traditional instruments from mbira through mouth-bow to kora. The improvisations weave rhythmic, melodic and harmonic motifs; constantly surprising the listener. Like Hanmer's work, this manages to escape conventions and subvert expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed's other release Society Vibe: A New Hope is the first fruit of his own Kalamazoo Label recording project; unashamed revivalism to keep the marabi/mbaqanga jazz genre alive. As such, there's no ground-breaking innovation to get excited about here -just very accomplished instrumentalism, swinging tunes and solid, clean arrangements. Saxophonist McCoy Mrubata blows up his usual storm, as does his more mature reed partner Scorpion Madondo.  The debate continues on how much this style still has to say; but that doesn't stop the album providing straightforward enjoyment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gito Baloi's Na Ku Randza moves the bass player into full-on Latin mode, with a dozen original songs and some fiery, stirring vocals from Chude Mondlane. There are times when Baloi's large ensemble (George Lee, Bruce Cassidy and Vaughan Tromp all pop up) really catches fire. The arrangements, however, are often dated, overcrowded (there's a real megadose of fuzzy guitar) and distracting. The lyrical quality of Baloi's duets (with Mondlane, and percussionist Moss Manaka) and his smaller-group arrangements suggest he'd do better to let his lines breathe a bit more. Sheer Sounds plan to continue their South African showcasing: the next batch of releases will include McCoy Mrubata, Sipho Gumede and Zim Ngqawana.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Soul-jazz diva Erykah Badu is climbing the world's charts and has been hailed as the new Billie Holliday. DAN GLAISTER takes in her British debut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">INCENSE, candles, an ethnic curio on the floor -the set suggests voodoo, but this is no voodoo show. Welcome to Baduizm, the precinct of Erykah Badu, a 26-year-old singer-songwriter from the previously unheralded musical frontier of South Dallas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this is no singer-songwriter in the Joan Osborne meaning of the term.  Badu's muse is a beguiling blend of Seventies soul and jazz hypnotics informed by the sassy sensibilities of hip-hop's verbal culture. Atop it all comes Badu's voice, something of fragile, cracked beauty that flits, floats and flirts around her music.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Badu is something of a phenomenon in the States. Her debut album, Baduizm, went platinum in two weeks early this year, while her debut single, On &amp; On, went gold, in the process crossing over from the R'n'B charts to the pop charts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Jazz Caf' in London for her British debut, there is a slightly unreal air of mellow anticipation. The cognoscenti are out in force to pay homage to one of the rare talents to have emerged from the overcrowded world of soul-jazz in the last few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The evening is a skilled, quiet celebration of her music, an event of intimacy rather than boisterous adulation. Badu gives a near-flawless rendition of most of the album, performing with ease and grace, interjecting a charm and spontaneity that go beyond the album's sometimes measured cool.  It is an evening to cherish, not least because the next time she is here, she is sure to play a larger venue. For now, though, it is her, a pared-down three-piece band and three backing singers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Did you see how that guy was dancing?&quot; she shrieks the next day when we meet in her hotel room. &quot;I was like, wait a minute, I think I chose the wrong person here. It kind of freaked me out.&quot; Was it a ritual humiliation? &quot;Oh no,&quot; she says, &quot;I do something new every show. I made up a song last night.  That's going to be on my second album.&quot; The song in question featured a memorable couplet involving the exchange of &quot;cash&quot; for &quot;ass&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospect of that difficult second album doesn't faze her. In fact, little does. &quot;It ain't difficult,&quot; she says, in a slow, sing-song drawl. &quot;I gotta lot o' mo'. I held back on the first album -heh-heh-heh. You have to try and convince the label that it's going to sell because they like to win, so I did what was required of me this time, but I got a lot o' mo' -a lot of stuff,&quot; she explains, in response to my puzzled look.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Badu, by her own admission, is a dreamy soul. &quot;I'm a typical Piscean dreamer,&quot; she says, big eyes sparkling. &quot;I'm seeing balloons and flowers and birds. I've been dressing you up while you been sitting there. I've dressed you up as a clown, I dressed you up as a stripper. I write when I'm on stage.  I do the music first usually, my songwriting lyrics are inspired by music. I can hear the song in the music. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Baduizm is not aimless dreaming. There is a very un-Piscean hard-edged practicality at work too. &quot;I'm a businesswoman as well, I make my money too, just like everybody else, even though my agenda is a little bit different to others. The music business is inspired by money. Music itself is inspired by inspiration. You just have to have a balance. You have to know how to sell that type of music. I have learnt to market myself without compromising myself, and that's the whole key. I'm a real person. It's just about being real, and convincing my label that this is what's happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D'Angelo is the name most often mentioned by way of comparison. But there is a more striking parallel: Billie Holliday. Badu is untroubled by the comparison. &quot;I think it's great,&quot; she says. &quot;If I'm doing what she could do then that's fabulous. If I am making an audience feel the way she did, then that's great. I invite her energy on to the stage.&quot; Badu is not, it must be said, unconfident of her abilities, exhibiting an assurance that doesn't always come with instant success. She takes immediate control of the hotel- room interview scenario, instructing me to sit in a chair squashed next to an oversized television cabinet while she busies herself applying makeup to one of her backing singers. Although sometimes enigmatic, verging on elusive in her answers, she is not afraid to ask the direct question.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How much of a debt is there to Marvin Gaye?&quot; I ask her.&quot;How much of a what?&quot; &quot;How much of a debt?&quot; &quot;How much of a what?&quot; &quot;How much do you owe him?&quot; &quot;I don't owe him anything. He gave hisself free, just I like I give of myself.  Marvin Gaye is one of my favourite singers, but Stevie Wonder is my favourite. I listened to Stevie Wonder in the womb.&quot; Talking about her influences, she pulls me up. &quot;A huge what? Cross-fertilisation? What does that mean? Uh ... Oh ... Yeah, I just grew up basically listening to Seventies music and hip-hop. In the hip-hop world what we do as a nation is to make music for one another. It's like a fun competition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to the rap there was a long history of performance, starting a school play at the age of seven. Playing a boy. &quot;I was sitting there looking at the boys auditioning, going like, 'terrible, not good at all'. I went home and practised it in front of my family and the next day I got up there and I blew the whole class away. I thought: 'They can't keep me off the stage now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way to stay on the stage was music. &quot;I got into it because I didn't want to work a nine-to-five job. I didn't want to be punching no clock and trying to be on time. That's just not my way of life.&quot; When the record deal came last winter, she demonstrated an enviable chutzpah, packing her backpack, waving goodbye to mama, and heading for a week in Jamaica.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is keen to assert that what you see is what you get. It is the real Erykah Badu on stage, not some music executive's exotic creation of the month.  &quot;Did you enjoy the show?&quot; she asks. &quot;Did you think was this real, or an act?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've got something to show you,&quot; she declares, returning with a bundle of objects that had accompanied her on stage the previous night. She takes me through them, item by item: the pendant her uncle made when she was born, the skirt a friend made for her, the ring her father made. They are all genuine articles. It is not even a stage name. &quot;My name was originally spelled E-r-i- c-a but I wanted to change it because we had a big explosion of black power.  I didn't want a slave name. I changed the spelling.&quot; So I have been initiated into the world of Baduizm, a world inhabited by dreamers and businesswomen, relics and myth, music and words. But have I understood its essence? Is there a universal programme I can sign up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erykah gives me a cool look. &quot;Izm is weed in the states. Baduizm is what's called the Badu high, it's supposed to get you high. Baduizm is my experience, my thoughts and my feeling, which don't represent anyone else but me.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - CRACK is a creedless, classless drug. You don't have to be rich or travel far for it. In fact, you can score a rock outside your local high school, at the mall, movies, or on practically every street corner in every inner-city suburb.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And from there, its strictly downhill. Which is why the creative team at DDB -formerly AM&amp;C -got down to gutter level to spread the fact that crack kills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This campaign is a follow-up to AM&amp;C's highly effective anti-cocaine campaign last year. Conceptualised by the agency's former creative team, Noel Tab and Rupert England, it won AM&amp;C a Loerie Award in 1996. Yet an indifferent press refused to print the ad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year's anti-crack Body Bag campaign -the brainchild of creative director Louis Gavin and copywriter Clinton Bridgeford with assistance from Dr Silvain De Miranda of Sanca -differs quite markedly from the previous one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cocaine campaign was gentler -offering the hope of rehabilitation.The crack campaign is far more savage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As communicated by the model dressed up to resemble a crack junkie and the messages littering gutters , shopping malls and movie houses, the most common way out of crack is via a body bag. The ominous-looking black plastic bags, placed in obvious drug-trading places, bear the legend, painted in white: &quot; What serious crack users are wearing this season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to being nominated for a Loerie award this year, the Body Bag campaign has caught the attention of the World Health Organisation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - WHEW. Breathing space. That's one of the first reactions one has to Zone, the all-girl group show currently on at the Generator Art Space.  Admittedly, the welcome sigh derives partly from the fact that these days almost anything represents a respite from the work of the Caucasian Testosterone Club -that abject little gang of boy-artists with an immense talent for cluttering up spaces with their own emptiness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Zone also passes the test on its own merits and the sensibilities of its curator Marlaine Tosoni. Although gender-specific in participation, it is broader in terms of the issues it explores. As the title suggests, Zone deals with the constructed barriers, thresholds and spaces that enable us to regulate, control and maintain the illusion of comprehending our own and one another's lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the exhibition is as much about atmosphere and physical spaces -within and beyond the confines of the works themselves -as it is about the exploration of metaphysical zones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show is refreshingly sparse in content and tone. It is comprised of only four works by four artists: Minette Vari, Jo Ractliffe, Jean Brundrit and Tosoni herself, each of whom has skilfully demarcated the architecturally unwieldy space of the gallery to suit their specific works. Brundrit's Cardiac Arrest, 1996-1997 -a photographic installation -is displayed in a monolithic, blackened box environment that enhances the fetishistic and abject nature of the objects selected for her pinhole photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in Decoy: Horizon 1997, Vari has placed a realistic landscape painting, not against the wall as conventionally expected, but suspended across the gallery space, intervening with it and intersecting it. The walls have become a canvas for painted zones leading to a &quot;booth&quot; of the kind used to advertise tourist packages. Vari uses virtually incoherent airport sounds to complement her visual parody of the travel industry. And in its entirety, the work serves simultaneously as a blurred barrier between reality and hype, where the advertised reality supersedes reality itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through vastly different means, Tosoni's work Bludgeoning the Conscience also deals with the flimsy patchwork we call &quot;reality&quot; and the festering underbelly that all too often threatens to rupture through supposedly pristine surfaces. Consisting of plastic bags sewn together with photographic images borrowed from the Child Protection Unit, it resembles a giant billowing curtain, simultaneously concealing and revealing. From a distance it resembles an aerial map. Up close it presents a bleak treatise on scarring that doesn't heal despite surface balms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But if Tosoni's obsession is with skins, Ractliffe's is with spaces, or rather the spaces between the spaces, in the liminal zones of anxiety and impermanence. Entitled Incidental and consisting of a short video taken of the sky, this work -unlike that of the other three artists -represents a shift from Ractliffe's previous concerns. The footage of a blue, although seemingly turbulent, sky -accompanied by a soundtrack of an equally troubled wind -was inspired by a 10-year-old newspaper report of a military jet that crashed into a school in Bologna, Italy. The only direct reference is the form of a piece of text reproduced on the gallery floor and quoted from the sole survivor of the wreck. And yet even without the exegetical explanation, the work conveys the sense of fear of the unknowable, the uncontrollable. And it is within this danger zone where desire and reality seem perilously close - yet remain tragically apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zone is at the Generator Art Space in Johannesburg until May 3</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The latest SA/UK gospel choir collaboration is a sign of the rebirth of interest in local choral music. GWEN ANSELL looks at the state of songs of praise</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HIT parade trends may come and go, but South Africa's love affair with gospel seems to go on forever. Its latest expression is an incandescent vocal collaboration between United Kingdom a capella group I Fagiolini and Jo'burg's Sdasa Chorale, who will be performing around Gauteng over the next week and recording a joint CD for the French Erato (Warner Classics) label.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the collaboration is taking place before a much broader backdrop. Last week, the Old Mutual national choral contest entered its third decade. And a recent survey of Cape schoolkids -whom you might expect to find immersed in kwaito and rap -found that a surprising number still listed &quot;becoming a member of a choir&quot; as a major ambition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So why the persistence of the form? For I Fagiolini's director, Robert Hollingworth, there's universal appeal in singing: &quot;Whatever the cultural differences, all peoples sing. The human voice is part of our basic genetic equipment.&quot; For Sdasa's Bheka Dlamini, who is also a prolific composer, it's the content of the music. &quot;The kinds of songs, and the words, remind people of who they are. The music can channel you to your culture and your creator.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For music writer Graeme Ewens, author of Afrika O-Ye, it's not just the lyrics. The tonal languages of southern Africa, he suggests &quot;generate melody lines which express a range of emotions in a kind of shorthand&quot;. Other musicologists have suggested additional reasons for the dominance of choral forms in this part of Africa, including economic, social and resource factors that limited the range of manufactured instruments. And Jazz Pioneers' leader Ntemi Piliso told this paper two years ago: &quot;Because of our history, the great strength of music in this region -whether we sing it or play it -is in the harmonies we've developed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sdasa leader Mokale Koapeng looks to the more recent history of urban musical development in this country. The choral tradition survived and flourishes, he feels, because it was never sidelined by modern trends. &quot;Look at the events and activities around a place like Dorkay House, for example.  There was classical music, jazz, folk music, gospel -musicians didn't label things and exclude them.&quot; Indeed, South Africa's first recording to hit the mass market, half a century ago, was in the choral tradition: Solomon Linda's Mbube.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That interchange between choral singing (especially gospel) and pop goes on.  Tshepo Tshola, Wendy Mseleku and Rebecca Malope are only three of dozens of current crossover artists, and any real Top 20 listing would have to include recordings by outfits like the Holy Spirits choir. Mahlatini's &quot;goat-voiced&quot; mqashiyo pop has its roots deep in village tradition, while Zulu iscathimiya singing (in the voices of Ladysmith Black Mambazo) has found its way on to international hit parades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulu performance conventions may make an appearance in a new guise at the Sdasa/I Fagiolini concerts. Their programme &quot;compares, contrasts and combines&quot; unaccompanied vocal music from Europe and Africa; rehearsals suggest this could produce some unexpected combinations, like the application of iscathimiya technique to a Renaissance anthem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 16-man Sdasa Chorale started life 11 years ago as a gospel choir; since then the group has broadened its repertoire to include all kinds of music, focusing especially on the original compositions of its members, the late GM Mojapelo, Mokale Koapeng, Bheka Dlamini and Monkitsi Seoketsa. Sdasa was choir of choice for last year's Grahamstown Festival main programme. The eight-member I Fagiolini group was also founded in 1986 at Oxford University, specialising in secular Renaissance music. Since then, they've also broadened their repertoire (after this trip, it will include some African hymns) and toured Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The UK Daily Telegraph dubbed their committed and passionate approach to the music &quot;Monteverdi with balls&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sdasa feel there has been a real rebirth of interest in choral music over recent years, and that events like the Old Mutual contests and the SAB's patronage of Sacma (the South African Choral Music Association) are part of the reason. &quot;But we shouldn't forget the early work put in by individuals like Professor Khabi Mngoma and groups like the Ionian Music Society,&quot; reminds Koapeng. &quot;And interest will build again now choral music is producing classical opera 'stars' like Sibongile Khumalo and Sibongile Mngoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Koapeng also feels the contests are a mixed blessing. &quot;I'm no longer operating within competitive choirs. Music was never meant to be competitive; the focus should be on singing, not winning. Also the idea of set works is musically very limiting; sometimes, you rehearse nothing but those two songs for the next six months. That's not good for musical development and creativity. I'd prefer to see more non-competitive festivals, and commissions for new and exciting works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seoketsa agrees. &quot;Many organisations provide sponsorship for the mileage, not the music. The guys with big bucks don't sponsor challenging works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hollingworth, and I Fagiolini's composer Roderick Williams, say conservatism among sponsors is an age-old problem, and one which affects European choirs too. What surprises them more is the lack of recognition black choral composers in South Africa receive outside their own arena. Says Williams: &quot;When we hear the singing, and the compositions, the idea of us coming here to teach is ridiculous. We are collaborating, and learning. But why are these compositions not more widely known outside the churches?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koapeng says flatly, &quot;It's a class thing,&quot; and tour organiser Brett Pyper agrees. &quot;In a period when there's concern about audience support for South African orchestras, we should be asking much more forcefully why there is no South African choral music in our concert repertoires.&quot; Dlamini smiles ruefully. &quot;I wonder, would our symphony orchestras dare to commission a black composer?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seoketsa, though, is looking outside the classical mileu. &quot;To me, the biggest challenge as a composer today is to look at the styles they use in contemporary pop music and draw on those in my future compositions. The challenge to us is to compose now in a modern musical language.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, although Sdasa's songs lack recording, they are far from unknown.  Churchgoers have recognised Seoketsa's U Jehova wherever the two groups have sung so far. &quot;There's a shortage of sheet music for foreign songs in poor communities,&quot; he says modestly, &quot;so people are hungry to grab indigenous and original songs.&quot; Adds Dlamini, &quot;That has made us, to some extent, role models.  I hope we can be musical rule-breakers too.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And how do the grassroots choristers feel about all this? Mpho Rachel Molefhe is a shop assistant in Yeoville who spends most of her spare time rehearsing and singing contralto in her choir, attached to one of Hillbrow's charismatic churches. Rehearsals consume most evenings. She faces lots of late and risky travelling. Why does she do it? Thought of competition hardly figures. &quot;Some of it is being with my friends and working together, enjoying ourselves. It's a social thing for me.&quot; And then, unconsciously echoing Bheka Dlamini, she adds, &quot;Oh, but when you sing you feel such joy; you know it must be going up to the Lord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hear the Sdasa/I Fagiolini collaboration at Wits Theatre on Saturday, in Soweto on Sunday and in a gala performance at Unisa next Wednesday</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'The struggle never made me famous.&quot; These are words uttered by a gangster at the height of his career. This is Gomorrah!, a powerful new work directed by Pule Hlatshwayo, and conceived by the cast, all graduates of the Market Theatre Laboratory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomorrah! explores the inevitability of violence as a way of life, the tentacles it develops that inadvertently destroy the innocent, as well as touching on its dubious glamour. Set in Alexandra, the story of David and Sipho's descent into gangsterism draws us gently along with them. However, it is the mechanisms used to reveal the story, that lie at the heart of Gomorrah!'s success as a piece of theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is essentially a linear story, unfolds as a piece of rounded artistry - in fragments. Through the use of mime, movement and action-packed drama, the piece becomes an interwoven series of visual and emotional images; moments of stark realism counter-balanced with the highly theatrical. A clashing of different languages -English and Tsotsitaal -is used to fine effect here.  When the language fails you, the visual images carry you through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an example of fine ensemble work. The performers are all strong and adept. It is a strenuous, fast-paced production, demanding on all the actors' skills. Mention must be made of Mpho Molepo, who plays the central character, David.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also Harriet Manamela, who invests her female gangster character with fascinating dualities: who is this woman with a gun who participates in the rituals assumed to be &quot;men only&quot;? Dumisane Phakathi's detailed characterisations are a joy to watch, as is the rest of the cast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The piece, because of its straddling of strong theatrical mechanisms and its sense of film, becomes a dense and riveting piece of theatre. At times I did feel that certain scenes needed to be more sharply focused, and that sometimes the direction needed to be tighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gomorrah! is living proof that South African Theatre is not dead. It is also important that the Market Laboratory is training people with raw talent and enthusiasm to become skilled professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gomorrah! is on at The Market until May 10</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - JUITH WATT reports on the plans for an annual SA fashion week</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN I mention that a South African Fashion Week is in the offing, my graceful friend -dressed top to toe in Gucci -gives a snort and asks if anyone here can spell fashion? Such derision is justified, given the mink and manure set who have historically characterised the charity fashion shows typical of white South Africa. But this new project, called The South African Fashion Week, might just be the start of something more real, planned as it is by Lucilla Booysen of Runway Productions and her colleague Estelle Cooper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the precedent set by the seasonal fashion weeks that showcases designers in New York, Paris, Milan and London alongside trade shows, Booysen has toyed with the idea for some time. By showcasing the work of designers and the seasonal ranges of top chainstores, Booysen and Cooper believe they will alert both the public and the industry to the range of neglected talent flowing throughout the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far they've met with enthusiasm. The top chainstores are keen. Designers who have either shown interest or confirmed are Jenni Button, Marianne Fassler, Hip Hop, Gabi Rosenwerth, Fred Eboka, Catherine Moore, Julian, Robert Hotz, Gavin Rajah, Andre Croukamp, The Boys, Jon-O, Jason, Mark and Michael and the Young Designers Emporium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will The South African Fashion Week really make the huge strides required to create a true design culture here? And will this also be a primarily white event? Paul Simon, the dynamic force who heads the Young Designers Emporia in Cape Town and Johannesburg represents no black designers as yet, but says Fashion Week is dealing with more important issues. He voices the discontent every designer I've ever interviewed has expressed &quot;off the record&quot; (bigwigs at a leading chainstore recently fell off their stilettos when asked point blank why they didn't support local designers instead of churning out overseas-inspired garments): &quot;This will give the chainstores a run for their money after all these years of monopolising the industry&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fashion here is always dominated by overseas trends, but the talent here is so overwhelming people should be coming up with their own look. Taking part in this will be worth it in terms of exposure alone .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Menswear designer Hotz, one of the few well-known black designers (he has teamed up with model Paul Phume; they are launching the Paul Phume menswear label), is keen, but lists a few basic truths: &quot;It's going to be tough getting the young designers, who are going to find money a problem. And how are they going to find them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These are the people who need the exposure, not the established names. The fashion system here is oriented towards the chainstores, who send their buyers to Europe to bring back samples and knock them off.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As usual, designer Fassler is at once charming and confrontational. &quot;South Africans are fashion followers, not leaders. When I do my own shows, I'm in charge of the spectacle and create my own atmosphere. So I have reservations about showing with other people and diluting my work. But I think it's a very brave concept, and if anyone can do it, Lucilla can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be three ramp shows per day during The South African Fashion Week. The cost for a one-hour show -and this will be subsidised -is R40 000.  That can be divided up into anything to suit the various financial resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chainstores' package is slightly different; they will in part subsidise designer talent. Garments will be sold after the shows, the public paying between R35 and R40 per ticket and each participant will receive 200 free tickets for clients, buyers and friends. Buyers and the media will be targeted in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SA Fashion Week is scheduled for August 7 to 10, with Sandton Square as venue</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - HAZEL FRIEDMAN reports on the controversial Section 13 clause and an outcry over control of state arts funding</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CULTURAL workers this week lashed out at the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology (DACST) for trying to hijack the independence of the newly established National Arts Council (NAC), the non-governmental statutory body that holds the key to the South Africa's cultural funding coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reason for their anger is a controversial clause called Section 13, which was inserted by the DACST into the draft NAC Act to be debated by Parliament in the third quarter of this year. Dubbed by some as &quot;Unlucky Thirteen&quot;, the clause gives the director general of the DACST the final right -in cases of appeal -to override any decision made by the NAC. But the department has denied responsibility for inserting the controversial clause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an editorial in the May issue of The Cultural Weapon, a monthly journal providing information on cultural issues, editor Mike van Graan pulls no punches in his condemnation of the clause and its implications for the future credibility of the NAC. He writes: &quot;It is interesting to note the appeal is to be directed for a final decision to the director general, a paid official who may or may not have any understanding and history of or sensitivity to arts and culture, rather than the minister who ... should at leat bear ultimate political responsibility for the Act and the NAC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Graan is a veteran cultural activist and former adviser to the Minister of Arts and Culture, Dr Lionel Mtshali. He was instrumental in the formation of Actag (Arts and Cultural Task Group) in 1994 to spearhead the democratic transformation of art and culture in South Africa. He helped write the government's White Paper on Arts and Culture as well as the first draft of the NAC Act. In that draft, he insists, Secton 13 did not exist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When approached for comment this week, the director general of the DACST, Roger Jardine, insisted that the department was not responsible for inserting the clause. Speaking on his behalf, the DACST's Carol Steinberg said: &quot;The department does not want the burden of responsibility for taking final decisions concerning the NAC, and we intend going to the parliamentary portfolio committee to have the appeal clause amended.&quot; She insists that: &quot; The initial proposal for the Bill was changed, not by the department, but by the state law adviser.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Gideon Hoon, state law adviser with the portfolio committee, who was responsible for drafting the Bill, dismissed the department's denial as &quot; utter nonsense&quot;. He added: &quot;I received a fax in September 1996 from the department, which included the Section 13 Right of Appeal. As a legal adviser, I am not part of the policy-making process. I only follow the department's instructions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it seems that those who will be most affected by the clause, the NAC body, is unaware of Section 13's existence. Actress Vanessa Cooke, who sits on the NAC executive board, said this week: &quot;It would be unfair to comment, because it has not yet been discussed by the board.&quot; But fellow executive member from KwaZulu-Natal, Professor Musa Xulu, was more outspoken. Speaking in his &quot;personal capacity&quot; he said: &quot;It is essential that the NAC gets off on the right footing. I would expect extreme problems with the expectations of the arts constitutency if we set up a structure without credibility. This clause will irreparably violate the principle of independent arm's-length funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his editorial, Von Graan also warns against the dangers of bringing party polics into the cultural arena. The DACST is ANC-aligned while Minister Mtshali belongs to the IFP. Von Graan writes: &quot;Perhaps it is one of the legacies ... where an IFP member presides over a department whose senior officials generally owe allegiance to the ANC that inevitable tensions manifest themselves in such a manner. This places even more of an imperative to be vigilant and protective of the NAC.&quot; He adds: &quot;If an official within the department be deemed to have the legal right to overturn a decision of the NAC, then the NAC may as well not exist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry spokesman Frans Basson has given Mtshali's assurances that the principle of arm's-length independence free from government intervention will be honoured when he steers the Bill through Parliament later this year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Vatican has published an extraordinary document accusing the advertising industry of appealing to such motives as envy, status-seeking and lust. Belinda Archer reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADVERTISING folk have always been partial to the odd bit of sinful behaviour - overeating, say, or even being a tad jealous of a colleague with a posher car. But, according to the Roman Catholic Church, the actual business of what they do is almost tantamount to the Eighth Deadly Sin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new 35-page booklet, Ethics in Advertising, has just been issued by the Vatican. Prepared by no less a body than the Pontifical Council for Social Communications - a grouping of 24 bishops from around the globe - it took three years to compile, in collaboration with 30 external media consultants, and went through numerous drafts before the final version emerged.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While acknowledging that advertising can be a force for good, it inevitably contains numerous pages on the supposedly negative effects of the industry, under such alarming chapter headings as &quot;The Harm Done by Advertising&quot; and &quot; Advertising and Social Responsibility&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;harm&quot; is broken down into just about everything, from the specific environmental damage caused by car commercials to the general moral and economic harm of promoting a lifestyle beyond people's means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also accuses advertisers of making &quot;deliberate appeals to such motives as envy, status-seeking and lust&quot;, and urges them to avoid &quot;manipulative, titillating and shocking ads&quot;. The conclusion involves a rather dark exhortation to agencies to be ethically responsible - as they and only they bear the moral burden of what they do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document was mailed out to Britain's Catholic parishioners and is en route to leading advertising bodies everywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jim McDonnell, lay director of the Catholic Communications Centre, who was consulted during the preparation of the document, explains why it came about.  &quot;The booklet was produced in response to the growing influence of advertising around the world,&quot; he says. &quot;It is simply a cry for agencies and advertisers to have a conscience and to be sensitive, not just to the people who employ them but to the impact on the public and society in general.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But are its messages the rantings of an out-of-touch group of clerics, or do the Pope and his team have a point? Should advertising have a moral and social responsibility? Do Nineties adfolk feel badly about what they do - and, if not, should they?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Robert Campbell, creative partner at Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe, dismisses such thoughts. &quot;The question is more whether we live in a moral world. We in advertising are just a cog in the machine, and of course we resort to irrational motives and appeal to people's sense of status or lust or envy. That's what we are about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Martin Smith, managing director of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, agrees. &quot;This is a rather myopic view from His Holiness. We have too much to do selling a client's brand rather than trying to change society. That is not our role or our job. In any case, advertising is in fact very moral - more so than many other communication methods. It's very regulated and judged. We have to substantiate everything we say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, the British ad industry chooses to abide by a fairly stringent self- regulatory code of conduct which stipulates that all they do should be &quot;legal, decent, honest and truthful&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also requires them to prepare all ads &quot;with a responsibility to the consumer and society and in line with the principles of fair competition&quot;.  All over-claiming is weeded out by various regulators, which, on balance, provide a relatively watertight control of advertising standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, of course, some rather wayward examples that slip through the net - such as Benetton's notorious press and poster work, which hijacks social issues for commercial gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chas Bayfield, a copywriter at Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and a member of Christians in Media, a voluntary body that promotes the Christian cause through a variety of media channels, backs the Papal document and believes UK adfolk should go further than their code requires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says: &quot;There are some ad people who believe it doesn't matter if you are immoral, as long as the ad sells. But that is not good enough. There are many ways of getting consumers on your side without resorting to appealing to people's lust or greed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nick Drummond, a copywriter at M&amp;C Saatchi, and also a Christian, similarly believes there is room for improvement. &quot;Advertising should take more of a moral stand,&quot; he says. &quot;Great advertising improves the quality of life, creates awareness of choice, and encourages lower prices through competition, but too often it resorts to lust and greed as people are driven by money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of morality can, of course, be a complicated one. Both Bayfield and Drummond have faced their own moral dilemmas recently: Bayfield over the use of sexual imagery - a thorny issue he debated hard with the client, also a committed Christian; and Drummond over the fact that he worked on the arguably un-Christian and unethical Demon Eyes anti-Blair poster for the Conservatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Sometimes ads take on a life of their own,&quot; says Drummond. &quot;It was the press that coined the phrase Demon Eyes - I was trying to denote that the Labour party are dangerous, not evil.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several agencies stake a claim for moral squeaky-cleanness by making a corporate stand over the handling of certain advertisers. Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, for example, is one of many that will not handle tobacco clients, but it also turns away toy advertisers, political parties or alco-pops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Howell Henry eschews working for any religious organisations. Others pride themselves on adopting transparent business practices, while just about every agency in town has a charity account, invariably run at a loss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A rather illuminating backdrop to the whole debate is the fact that the Vatican itself condones advertising; indeed, it has used Saatchi and Saatchi Rome to create a series of rather lavish fund-raising campaigns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campbell is not happy. &quot;This whole thing smacks of rather outdated paranoia and hypocrisy about advertising and the advertising industry,&quot; he says. &quot; Perhaps the Catholic Church ought to look to itself before accusing others of encouraging and supporting avarice.&quot; And perhaps Campbell should be saying a few Hail Marys in penance for that remark</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pontiff's problem areas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Moral and religious harm of advertising: Commercial advertisers sometimes include religious themes or use religious images or personages to sell products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is possible to do this in acceptable ways, but the practice is obnoxious and offensive when it involves exploiting religion or treating it flippantly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Cultural harm: Advertising also can have a corrupting influence upon culture and cultural values. All too often, advertising contributes to the invidious stereotyping of particular groups. This often is true of the way advertising treats women; and the exploitation of women, both in and by advertising, is a frequent, deplorable abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertising can be tasteful and in conformity with high moral standards, and occasionally even morally uplifting, but it also can be vulgar and morally degrading. Frequently it deliberately appeals to such motives as envy, status seeking and lust. Today, too, some advertisers consciously seek to shock and titillate by exploiting content of a morbid, perverse, pornographic nature.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Lesedi Stereo 87.7 to 90.6 FM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JAZZ is said to be a minority music and yet it has outlived the more popular styles. On SABC radio this noble art form has been part of music programming for more than 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early Sixties, SABC radio even went as far as recording jazz musicians and flighting the music. The late piano genius, Gideon Nxumalo, an accomplished performer, doubled as a producer and presenter of jazz at SABC.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the corporation decided to &quot;be nice&quot; to blacks and allocate them their own stations, jazz was among the first programmes to win a place of pride in their live programming.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lesedi Stereo, then known as Radio Sesotho, had some of the best jazz programmes on air. The most widely regarded presenter then was the late Selai Selepe, a jassophile through and through. His show became an institution and his death robbed jazz of an eloquent ambassador.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The show has since been hosted by many others in its long history, among them Teboho Koekoe, Sello Thulo, Pula Pula Mothibi (who elevated the show to new heights), and Mamontha Modise (the first woman to present jazz on Lesedi).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The station continues to express its faith in women. The current presenter is a young 20-something woman, Puleng Thulo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Thulo is still relatively new as a jazz presenter, the rich jazz tradition of Lesedi FM is not compromised at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The format is largely based on American jazz. While commercial stations focus on new jazz, Lesedi tends to play more old music, bringing back some of the classics of Coltrane, Miles, Hodges and Rollins. There isn't enough South African jazz being played, but then again you won't find much of it being played on SABC as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're a real jazz fundi, you'll be pleased to note that on this programme there is no space for fusion jazz, which most true blue jazz fans regard as a ghastly prostitution of a noble music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Make a date with Thulo this Sunday at 11h00 on Lesedi Stereo. This show is a meagre one hour, but well worth listening to.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In an impassioned oral presentation to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), members of the newly formed Independent Producer's Organisation discussed the viable options for a new &quot;free-to-air&quot; channel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation responded to the IBA's discussion paper on the channel, honing in on local content and independent production, programming contributions, language, employment equity and human resource development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his introduction, the organisation's chair Mfundi Vundla said: &quot;Public service broadcasting is not merely the opposite of commercial broadcasting.  It is not merely a category of programmes. It is not factual programmes or educational programmes or serious programmes. It is not an insert on disabled children with the title Our Channel Cares. It is an attitude ... It is the soul which belongs deep inside any broadcasting institution which prevents itself from selling itself and us all to American values for R300 a minute.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">References were made to local quotas and how some broadcasters, notably M- Net, get by with cheap local soap operas and talk shows to meet the criteria for local content. Although fundamentally agreeing with many of the IBA's proposals, the organisation stressed the need that a new private broadcaster should not just be given a licence to print money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vundla reflected that the submission comes at a difficult time for the SABC as it is attempting to restructure itself amid a string of financial woes.  The corporation has blamed its fiscal problems on its &quot;mandate&quot;, to which Vundla replied that the organisation believed &quot;the mandate is a red herring.  The SABC has financial problems not because it broadcasts in too many languages, nor because it carries too much local content.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We reject this with contempt and an analysis of SABC's local content will show that the top income-generating programmes and top-rated shows are all locally produced.&quot; He went on to blame the crisis on mismanagement and lack of vision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the organisation have privately voiced distress about the future of the local industry as it is hampered by inefficient bureaucrats with creativity disappearing under a maze of administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive member of the organisation, Mark Newman, said there was &quot;hope&quot; for the future and the submission to the IBAwas &quot;encouraging&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With local programmes commissioned by the SABC at their lowest ebb in 12 years, the organisation is one of the few bodies fighting for a viable, and indeed artistic, industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The five bidders for South Africa's first private TV station have criticised many of the IBA's proposed regulations for the new licence.  Gillian Farquhar reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RAINBOW TELEVISION and Vula Television are the latest entrants in the race for South Africa's first &quot;free-to-air&quot; private television licence, to be awarded in November by the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This brings the number of bidders to five, with just three months to go before the licence application deadline on July 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although there is growing anticipation by frustrated television viewers that they will be offered a wider choice by the end of the year, the new station will only begin broadcasting in 1999.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week all five applicants strongly criticised the IBA's proposed regulations for the new licence during public hearings on the authority's private television discussion paper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calling for a &quot;lighter touch&quot;, the five contenders agreed that more flexibility was necessary if the new station is to be commercially viable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The five contenders for the single national television licence are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Vanessa du Plessis, wife of Gauteng Newspapers managing director Deon du Plessis, and her Community Television Network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Former SABC head Quentin Greene's Free- to-Air consortium, together with Kagiso Trust Investments and Dali Tambo's African Dream television consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Station for the Nation, with founding shareholders Moribo Investments (a subsidiary of Thebe Investments), Interleisure and Nine Network Australia.  Former Pan Africanist Congress politician !Khoisan X is also involved in the consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Rainbow Television, headed by Matthews Malefane, incorporates Rainbow Trust, &quot;a broad-based grass roots membership initiative&quot; and foreign partners who are &quot;United States and Asian global media players&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* RM Production house head Rapitse Montsho's Vula Television, partnered by the Youth Investment Network, a national economic empowerment organisation for black youth; Letsogo's Women's Investment; and the National Empowerment Consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community Television Network, Station for the Nation and Vula Television have not disclosed their foreign partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA policy framework has put forward three possible models for the private television licence:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a national television service;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a network of three regional stations; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a national service with provincial windows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The requirements set out in the IBA's proposed policy paper are that the new television services must be available to the majority of South Africans; provide news, information and local drama according to quotas; cater for provincial diversity; supply programming for children; reflect South African identity, culture and character; and contribute to the development of South African languages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Station for the Nation argued in its submission that the proposed local drama quota of 234 hours per year was &quot;unsustainable&quot; and &quot;far in excess of the broadcast regulations of other countries with more developed television and film production industries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Free-to-Air estimated that the cost of fulfilling the local drama quota would be between R90-million and R110-million a year and agreed with Station for the Nation that the IBA's proposed quotas placed the profitability and financial viability of the private television licensee in &quot;serious doubt&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community Television Network, Vula Television, Rainbow Television and Free- to- Air suggested more flexibility in programme classification and screening times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vula Television called for &quot;quality rather than quantity&quot; to be the primary factor in quota considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IBA's proposed restriction on advertising time - 10min/hr - during prime and shoulder time also came under fire. Most contenders were against regulations on content or placing limits on advertising time, with one applicant noting that the IBA should be careful that &quot;it does not deregulate only to re-regulate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private television channel will rely solely on adspend and sponsorship for its revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most contenders said advertising will automatically affect audience reaction to the channel - too much advertising may deter viewers who become irritated by the interruptions, while minimal advertising may sustain some viewers. Self-regulation will then become a matter for the station's management and will not need outside intervention, they argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Station for the Nation said there was &quot;insufficient&quot; ad revenue to support more than four channels and that M-Net's two- hour window time already accounted for much of the available adspend. However, Community Television Network's Vanessa Du Plessis said a rise in adspend could be expected as the economy was in the early stages of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In contrast to other contenders who were satisfied with the Advertising Standards Authority's (ASA) regulation, Vula Television said the ASA's code was &quot;lax&quot;, with regulations often &quot;too open&quot; to interpretation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vula Television proposed a ban on gender and racial stereotyping and other forms of prejudice in both advertising and editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most contenders supported the proposed limit of 20% foreign ownership in the new television station, with Community Television Network arguing that it was necessary &quot;to keep the rights of South Africans to their own airwaves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Rainbow Television appealed to the IBA to &quot;seriously consider&quot; flexibility in this area. Malefane said the transfer of resources and skills from foreign partners would enable a fledgling South African television station to one day become world class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Community Television Network argued that there were adequate resources available locally to finance the transfer of skills, deeming it unnecessary to indulge foreign partnerships.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the IBA takes to heart the contenders' overall view on proposed public service obligations for the new television station, viewers can look forward to more programme diversity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Businessman Strive Masiyiwa was all set to introduce Zimbabwe's first cellphone network when the government stepped in. Jan Raath reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STRIVE MASIYIWA says it is fair comment that his conversion to born-again Christianity coincided roughly with an offer he could not refuse from two political heavyweights in Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cabinet minister and a member of the party politburo, they fetched him in a Mercedes from his office in August 1994 and took him to their suite in the Avenues, central Harare. They wrote US$400 000 on a scrap of paper and said he would have to pay them that if he wanted to set up Zimbabwe's first cellular telephone network.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also wanted a large chunk of the equity of his company, Econet, for which they did not propose to pay anything. Agree, and &quot;we can have this sorted out inside a week&quot;, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If he opposed them, he was told, he would never be allowed to operate. He was given a detailed account of how they would block him, even if he had the full might of the law behind him. &quot;You don't know how much power we've got,&quot; they said. &quot;If you want to run a business in this country, you have to talk to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masiyiwa did refuse. &quot;I remember leaving and thinking, 'wow',&quot; he said this week. &quot;I was overwhelmed. And everything that has happened since then, they said would happen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is not a scrap of evidence for any of this. There were no witnesses, and you have only his word for it. He would be sued for his last cent if he named the pair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this report is the only clue to understanding the breathtaking web of deceit and the formidable barrage of resistance laid in his way by President Robert Mugabe's government to prevent him from switching on his cellphone network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One is also inclined to believe him. Educated at an exclusive public school outside Edinburgh and degreed in electrical engineering at the University of Wales in Cardiff, he is the opposite of the other figures in Zimbabwe's &quot; indigenous&quot; business circles - like white-hating tycoon Roger Boka, or Phillip Chiyangwa, self-styled &quot;chief strategist&quot; of the radical Affirmative Action Group, who threatens &quot;extreme measures&quot; against the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a continent where business is dirtier and rougher than anywhere else, Masiyiwa (36) manages to radiate fresh, good cheer and enthusiasm that he doesn't owe to his religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is articulate, approachable, talks a lot, but listens. His staff likes him. &quot;He's the first black boss I have had,&quot; said one of the five whites in his 50- strong company. &quot;He's demanding, but fair. It's been a pleasure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent attempted deterrent to his enterprise was at 4pm on April 4 when CID detectives turned up at his offices with an order for his arrest, falsely claiming he had illegally offered public shares in his company. Faced with a wall of lawyers, they retreated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masiyiwa and Econet have become the inspiration for the wave of angry indignation against Mugabe's government and the disdain it shows for the rule of law and transparency as it dispenses huge business contracts to members of the coterie of politicians and businessmen that have become known as &quot;the Mugabe royal family&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An indication of the deep support Econet has is its access to information. &quot; This is not a very open government,&quot; Masiyiwa said. &quot;You don't get minutes of meetings. But I don't have to do a thing. It all comes to us. It comes from messengers, it comes from every possible source. If there is a meeting, or any development, we are told about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no suggestion that the government has been touched by the embarrassing disclosures of political manipulation of contracts last year, with the Zim $1- billion new Harare airport terminal and the Zim $6-billion sale of the country's largest power station to a Malaysian company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month ago it awarded a licence to operate a cellphone network to Telecell, a Virgin Islands-registered company with a local directorship peppered with relatives of senior politicians, including Mugabe's nephew, Leo. It appears to have failed every set of criteria required by the tender board, but got it on the strength of a directive from the president's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Econet's bid failed. The company has been ready since February last year to provide a service to 20 000 subscribers. &quot;It's up and running, it's fully operational. But we cannot offer a service to the public because I will be arrested if we do,&quot; Masiyiwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He began his enterprise in 1992 and immediately ran into resistance. In December 1994, he won the celebrated high court ruling that described the state-controlled Posts and Telecommunications Corporation telephone system as being so bad that it violated the constitutional right to freedom of expression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been four other high court battles and another is on the roll.  The ninth high court challenge is also pending. Legal expenses have not damaged him because he keeps winning and being awarded costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But still no operating licence. Instead, the government gave one to its corporation with a severely overloaded subscriber capacity of 5 000. Now Telecell has one too, and says it may be ready to run in six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Running a highly technical company with Zim $100-million worth of infrastructure under an official bar on earning income would have finished off others long ago. He sold his house and his 4X4 and now drives a Toyota Venture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sometimes it gets scary. One of my colleagues is permanently negotiating money. He got everybody paid for the month. Now he's started all over again.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the money is local, he says, and none has come from South African-based MTN, which late last year took a 30% share in the company. &quot;That's where the faith is. There are guys, bankers, black businessmen, who tell me, we won't let you down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For how long can he keep going? &quot;As long as God remains in it, I'm in it,&quot; he responds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, but God doesn't issue cellphone licences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Art will soon stop playing the role of Oliver Twist to the public and private sector's Mr Beadle. This is the prophesy of Dr Chris Mann, convenor of what could well be a landmark international conference on the economic benefits of arts and culture in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A project of the Grahamstown Foundation - of which Mann is operations director - and earmarked to take place from June 11 to 13, just before the Standard Bank National Arts Festival in Grahamstown in July, the conference has already attracted some of the most visible names in both the art of business and the business of art.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference will be opened by Deputy Minister of Arts and Culture Brigitte Mabandla. Speakers will include top-level government officials and private sector researchers with successful investment strategies in the fields of cultural economics. Also included in the illustrious line-up are delegates from the Netherlands, Morocco, Mexico, the United States, Germany, Canada, Egypt and Thailand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on regional studies, delegates will speak about successful corporate-cultural projects in their respective countries, and ways in which these can be adapted to suit South Africa's situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The aims of the conference are to learn about the international experience of the economic benefits of arts and culture and to apply this experience in a practical, pragmatic way to this country,&quot; says Mann.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To do this we have to explore what funding and educational strategies are required to maximise the economic potential of culture in South Africa, publicise the findings and help equip local decision-makers with information that would enable them to make rational and productive investment decisions regarding the future of arts and culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference is being organised at a time when the wheels of Business Arts South Africa (Basa) are starting to turn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in February this year, with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki serving as honorary patron, Basa aims to pursue sponsorship money for the arts and create an informed liaison between corporate money and hungry cultural mouths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Basa has planned a workshop during the conference to present its own objectives to arts organisations attending the sessions and to suggest ways - through proper planning, training and investment - of transforming arts and culture into a significant South African industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need to initiate a shift away from the public perception of arts and culture as a luxury, towards the realisation that it is a major job creator, urban and rural regenerator and foreign-exchange earner,&quot; says Mann. &quot;It's time that South African arts and culture got rid of the begging bowl.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Sandton ratepayers' revolt is gaining momentum as 10 businesses take the local council to court, reports Ferial Haffajee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's most costly rates revolt in one of its richest municipalities - the Johannesburg suburb of Sandton - is now in its ninth month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the protest has found a new battleground in the past two weeks as captains of Sandton industry hauled the area's local council, responsible for Sandton and surrounding suburbs, into Johannesburg's High Court, charging that it had illegally levied millions of rands for redistribution to Johannesburg's poorer areas such as Soweto and the sprawling townships of the West Rand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not so, says the council, pointing out that the revolt was premised on a fiction; rates were increased so that Sandton now pays exactly the same as others who live in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's 6,45c in a rand; up from 2,58c, which Sandtonites paid before the increase and before changes to local government. Court papers show these were the lowest rates among Johannesburg's four councils.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sandton enjoyed an indirect subsidy to the rich. We're not even talking about a progressive tax here,&quot; says a council source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lawyers for the 10 businesses objecting to their rates increase also say the council did not have the power to raise a levy from ratepayers (both residential and business) and then to pass it on to Johannesburg's poorer parts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal mud-slinging aside though, the boycott is biting - the Sandton ratepayers' federation, Sanfed, says its protest is costing the council about R25-million every month. Sandton is responsible for half the rates raised in Greater Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protesters' planning station is a small but well-equipped office in one of Sandton's many shopping centres. The tools of struggle copied from the boycotters of old are everywhere: the hard-talking posters lining the walls, the constantly ringing phones, the well-used copying machine (to keep up the media propaganda war) and the stalwart who keeps it all together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Lambson has been involved in municipal affairs for longer than he can remember. Like others, he got a shock last year when the rates bill for the townhouse he lives in increased from R137 to R331 a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negotiations with the hapless new councillors came to nought in a suburb where residents were accustomed to being listened to by the old council. &quot; There was little or no consultation. Instead all we got was this comic budgeting,&quot; says Lambson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Comic budgeting&quot; in this case was a little new South Africa book-keeping.  Johannesburg's umbrella council, the Greater Johannesburg Metropolitan Council, transferred the surpluses raised in its more flush eastern council, including Sandton, which raised R438-million, and northern council (including Randburg) to others. There's nothing unusual in that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gavin Lewis, the editor of The RDP Monitor says: &quot;There is definitely a redistributive element in all metropolitan areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What troubles local government consultant David Solomon more is the manner in which the increase was imposed. &quot;Simply doing it that way is not accountable. It's not acting in the public interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sandton public reacted by either withholding their rates payments completely or paying the old amount with a reasonable increase added (in most cases, protesters paid 20% more).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sanfed says that in the past two months, more people have started a full boycott, paying nothing at all. But most protesters still tear off the perforated ends of their green accounts, pay their old bill plus a bit and scrawl a note on their accounts to the council: &quot;Payment for portion of rates bill only. I consider the full increase unreasonable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In August last year, 10 leading Sandton companies, including Liberty Life and Fedsure, stopped paying the increase and decided to take the council to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now they've asked the court to throw out the local council's budget.  Critics say that business stands to save millions from its protest. They point out that Sandton's lower rates was a factor in attracting the many businesses away from Johannesburg central.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case also mirrors the urgent need for new ways of funding local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewis says councils' ability to raise revenue is limited in the main to dog taxes, car licences and rates. He says this should be expanded to include a percentage of revenues raised per province. &quot;The fund- raising powers of the provinces need to be redefined.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council's coffers meanwhile get leaner and leaner. And while the huge plastic bowl marked &quot;Fighting Fund&quot; in Lambson's office is empty for now, the boycott shows no sign of letting up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week the Sandton residents will chalk up another first as they become South Africa's only protesting community to hit cyberspace with their own Web site.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Fiscal deficits can play a useful role in boosting growth and social investment, writes Asghar Adelzadeh of the National Institute for Economic Policy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Budget deficit is the lynchpin of fiscal policy, linking government spending, taxation and public debt. An appropriate fiscal deficit unbinds the Budget constraint, enabling the public to defer the burden of social spending, including productive investment in education, health, housing and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deficits can also stimulate economic growth, boosting the necessary demand for goods and services to foster higher levels of employment. Fiscal policy must weigh the benefits from greater investment in social and physical infrastructure and higher employment against the costs associated with servicing the debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is an appropriate fiscal strategy for South Africa aimed at fostering redistribution through social and infrastructural investment while promoting high rates of economic growth and employment?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overwhelming cross-country evidence demonstrates that higher public social and infrastructural investment &quot;crowds in&quot; (leads to higher) private investment, particularly when public investment is complementary to private investment and corrects a market failure, as does social and infrastructural investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;crowding out&quot; argument is based on a proposition that fiscal deficits reduce financial resources available for private investment by causing the interest rate to rise and thus increasing the cost of capital. The international evidence on the relationship between interest rates and fiscal deficits is, however, weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the context of South Africa's transformation, three empirical and policy questions arise:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Since the relationship between social investment and economic growth and employment depends on the political choice of fiscal policy, is it desirable to austerely control the fiscal deficit? In short, will lower fiscal deficits lead to greater economic growth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Since social infrastructure investment can be financed through increased taxation, does South Africa's current tax structure lend itself to reform and increased revenue?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Since social infrastructure investment can also be financed through increased borrowing, is South Africa's current debt structure amenable to increased indebtedness?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Budget deficit and economic growth: The appropriate level for the deficit is one of the most controversial questions for economic policy-makers. To address the relationship between deficits and growth, data for 78 countries over the past 48 years have been analysed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The results show there is no robust universal relationship between deficits and growth. In some cases, large deficits are consistent with high levels of growth, and deficit reduction is correlated with falling rates of growth. In others, the opposite pertains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These results are easily explained by economic theory. Growth and deficits are linked by economic factors which operate in opposite directions and depend on the state of the economy, which varies from country to country and from period to period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, in a demand-constrained economy higher deficits can lead to higher growth. Yet the causality can run in the opposite direction, with opposite results: higher growth can lead to improved tax revenues, causing the fiscal deficit to fall. Also, a supply shock to the economy, such as higher international interest rates, can cause growth to fall while the fiscal deficit rises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The important point here is that there is no single relationship between fiscal deficits and economic growth. The appropriate fiscal deficit policy varies from country to country, depending on the level of development, the capacity of the economy, and the stage of the business cycle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Data for South Africa since 1980 demonstrate a negative correlation between economic growth and high deficits, owing to South Africa's poor growth performance leading to a deterioration in the country's fiscal position.  There is no evidence that fiscal deficits have impeded economic growth.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mistaking the direction of causality has perverse consequences. Attempting to remedy the falling growth by reducing the fiscal deficit exacerbates the problem, particularly if the economic downturn was caused by an inadequate level of overall demand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Taxation policy: South Africa's tax structure depends heavily on regressive forms of taxation, like value-added tax (Vat), and fails to take advantage of more progressive taxes, such as the capital gains tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, there is no evidence that South Africa is over-taxed, but the lower- and middle-income groups bear a disproportionate share of the burden owing to the structure of the tax system. While South Africa's tax burden - as measured by the ratio of total government revenue to gross domestic product (GDP) - has risen consistently over the past 25 years, other industrialised countries, such as Japan, Canada, and France, have experienced much more rapid increases. A comparison with middle-income countries leads to the same conclusion, although the difference is not as striking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the medium term, the resources required for social and infrastructural investment can be most efficiently mobilised by increasing taxes in a progressive manner. A fiscal policy that promotes both redistribution and growth will increase the progressivity of the tax structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over a period of several years, the average tax rate can be raised by 3 to 5% of national income without jeopardising a growth and employment-oriented economic strategy. This would generate significant additional financial resources for social and infrastructural investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are several areas of taxation that demonstrate both revenue and equity potential for reform. A more progressive income tax, a super-VAT on luxury goods, and a tax on capital gains will all increase government revenue, while promoting a more progressive tax structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increased emphasis on tax compliance will also generate substantial revenue while furthering equity considerations. The implementation of a minimum tax on corporations will enhance progressivity while providing incentives for greater compliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Public debt: Our public debt is low by international standards; comparisons of debt ratios and statistical analysis confirm that South Africa is not at risk of falling into a &quot;debt trap&quot;. South Africa's debt ratio is lower than that of nearly every industrialised country (see graph).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, since South Africa's debt is predominantly held by South African residents, the payment of interest on the debt does not constitute a significant net drain on the nation's resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, the high interest payment on the public debt is significantly due to a monetary policy focused on disinflation by maintaining high interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since effective tax reform will not reach its full potential for several years, South Africa can increase its ratio of public debt to national income and still maintain debt levels that are low in comparison to other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds generated would provide the resources necessary to finance social and infrastructural investment over the immediate horizon, bridging the shortfall until the full benefits of tax reform are realised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, the growth generated directly by public social and infrastructural investment and indirectly by crowding-in effects of such investments will bolster tax revenue, contributing to the resources raised through progressive tax reform, and the gradual decline of the debt-GDP ratio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A programme of fiscal austerity focused on deficit reduction will undermine prospects for economic growth. Policies that reduce social and infrastructural investment are likely to backfire and lead to greater fiscal deficits and macro-economic instability. Fiscal policy must be a pivotal vehicle for democratisation and transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa clearly has the necessary resources. The challenge that lies ahead is to mobilise and channel them into enhancing social well-being and economic opportunity for everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is based on a paper commissioned by the National Institute for Economic Policy from Dr Micheal Samson of the South African Institute for Financial Policy Options</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TRADE and Industry Minister Alec Erwin is to lead a delegation to Havana, Cuba, this weekend, followed by two days in Mexico, before joining Deputy President Thabo Mbeki in the United States at a meeting of Southern African Development Community leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Labour flexibility plea</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) this week reiterated its plea for greater labour flexibility. Sacob director general Raymond Parsons said the stripping of protectionist barriers meant jobs were being lost. But labour needed to show greater flexibility for job creation to succeed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Andrew Levy &amp; Associates' strike report for the first quarter found working time lost to strike action fell by more than half against the same period last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The labour consultancy found that the new Labour Relations Act had contributed to the drop. The biggest strikes this year included those at Mondi, Sappi and Volkswagen. Earlier this week, settlement was reached in the four-week-old strike at multi-national Nestl'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jakarta venture</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* TRANSNET subsidiary, Marine Data Systems, and German group, Daimler Benz Aerospace, have been awarded a R35-million contract for the supply and installation of a vessel traffic management system for the Jakarta port.  Marine Data Systems will provide an automatic identification system for ships as part of Indonesia's Tanjung Prick Port contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fiat chief charged</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A TURIN court has found Fiat chair Cesare Romiti guilty of falsifying company records to hide a political slush fund. Romiti was given an 18-month suspended sentence. He and financial director, Francesco Paolo Mattioli, were also ordered to pay fines of $4 700 each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rolls sales boost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* ROLLS-ROYCE has sold 78 more cars in the first quarter of the year than in the same period last year. Total sales of 236 units were notched up in the United Kingdom. A basic Rolls-Royce would set you back about R1-million, with a little change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Big Mac, small bonuses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* MCDONALD'S has paid reduced bonuses to its biggest international executives because of its shrinking bottom line. Chief executive Michael Quinlan took home 2,5% less in bonus pay than the previous year. The international burger chain has seen profits drop for the fourth consecutive quarter. The company forked out many millions on marketing a deluxe range of sandwiches, which failed to bite with consumers. Instead, all that's growing are customer complaints that the Big Mac's getting blander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dull gold</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GOLD improved by 30 cents mid-week to open at $347,95 in Hong Kong. But the gold price was generally lower on world markets this week. American stocks plunged 45 points on the Dow Jones index ahead of an inflation report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Real men don't drink beer anymore - at least not in the quantities they used to. Nowadays even lager louts appreciate a fresher taste.  That's the message from HP Bulmer, Britain's biggest and oldest cider manufacturer, which is bringing its premium brand, Scrumpy Jack, to the South African market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Available initially only on tap in pubs, the beverage will be imported in kegs, with a bottled version following later in the year. With the rapid growth of the Anglo/Irish pub trade, says Paul Siviter, international marketing director of HPBulmer, a target of 250 pub accounts by August or September is feasible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between them, Stellenbosch Farmers' Wineries (SFW) and South African Breweries (SAB) have the market sewn up. SFW's share, dominated by Crown and Hunter's Gold, is about 80% and SAB recently weighed in with Redd's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siviter, however, is undaunted: &quot;Launching on draught represents a substantial investment - but it's critical to the overall strategy to develop Scrumpy Jack into the leading premium cider in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;SAB's distribution muscle is too great to take on across the board, so it makes better sense to cultivate the premium end of the market, hence Scrumpy Jack, which has always been sold as a high-quality product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got 25 000 outlets in Britain; we're not looking at the same here yet - but we'll get there one day.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local law is harsh on cider makers - South Africa is the only country where to qualify as cider the alcohol content must be sourced only from the apples, not in the fermentation process, which explains the proliferation of &quot;apple- based&quot; drinks that aren't anything like the real thing. Bulmer has had to develop a special recipe to qualify, adding to the expense of setting up operations here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siviter is undeterred. &quot;This market is second only to Britain in terms of consumption of apple-based alcoholic drinks, with sales of about 125-million litres/year. So it makes sense to want a slice of the pie. Our second-phase plan is to import in bulk and repackage, then depending on how things go, we will consider setting up a manufacturing operation, importing only the apple pulp from Britain.&quot; This is because the apples that give cider that distinctive bitter- sweet taste only grow in Herefordshire, England. But some local varieties might be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulmer's initial investment is about R2- million. It has set up a partnership with Bavaria Br&quot;u, another niche player with two specialist beers and the distributorship for Two Dogs, the Australian alcoholic lemonade, and Sirocco, an alcoholic soda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Potential bidders may think again before taking on SAA's losses, now set to top R400-million, writes Ferial Haffajee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS (SAA) may now be up for grabs, but potential bidders are likely to baulk at the extent of its losses - now tipped to top R400- million in 1996-97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The disappointing prognosis comes at a bad time: earlier this week Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau announced plans to fully privatise the national carrier. Until now, the government's stated intention has been to sell only a stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the airline's management told staff that unaudited figures showed a loss of R345-million, but industry sources say the figure is likely to top R400-million, with one pessimistic pundit placing it as high as R438- million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's been quite a slide for SAA. In the previous year, it showed a healthy profit of R147-million. But increased competition - 66 new airlines have come into the country since 1994 - and a weaker rand took their toll. Most of SAA's costs, such as fuel, maintenance and spares, are paid in dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other reasons for the poor showing. Industry insiders say management needs a shake-up. They point out that other than the appointment of SAA executive director, Zukile Nomvete, there's no new blood at SAA. &quot; There's no one new at SAA; the old-style apparatchiks still rule the roost,&quot; says an aviation analyst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also been a brain drain from SAA. Andre Venter, the president of SAA's staff association, Salstaff, says: &quot;There's a terrible lack of trained supervisors and management. People are still in a comfort zone. They must know the ossewa (ox-wagon) age is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff association is likely to give privatisation its stamp of approval.  So are the South African Pilots Association and the Flight Engineers Association. But the Congress of South African Trade Unions- aligned South African Railway and Harbours Union will take greater persuasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SAA sell-off is still many negotiating hours away, however, as plans must be passed by all parties in terms of the National Framework Agreement agreed to by government and labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, it may be difficult to find a buyer for an airline returning such a loss. The Transport Department's Director General Khetso Gordhan says: &quot;The loss is of great concern to us. The Transport Department's policy is to maximise competition and SAA's loss is creating an unlevel playing field.&quot; Commercial airlines would not survive such a loss and SAA can only stay afloat because it falls in the Transnet stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gordhan says SAA's privatisation should be &quot;fast-tracked&quot; to get it back into the black more quickly. Gordhan says that despite SAA's poor showing, there's great international interest in SAA, most notably from British Airways and Lufthansa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one aviation analyst doesn't think it will be so easy to lure a foreign buyer. He points out that British Airways has already tied up a lucrative (and free) deal with Comair. &quot;They get their branding on all Comair flights.  There's a natural flow of passengers and cargo; why should they invest in an airline that's losing money?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lufthansa's new business credo is &quot;if we don't have to spend money, we won't&quot;. So that airline is likely to look for synergies - like complementary flights - instead. Both KLM and Virgin have set their sights on Sun Air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA's fleet is also old and expensive to maintain. The airline has a bloated staff and a management corps that avoids making tough decisions about unprofitable routes. But this week it announced it would cut loss-making routes and take other &quot;ruthless&quot; business decisions to break even in the new financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the bad news, some local and regional aviation companies are keen to buy into SAA. The editor of Air Report, Linden Birns, says the airline has a competitive domestic network and strong regional links. And while complaints about shoddy service standards are growing, Birns says &quot;the airline has a very highly trained staff, especially in the safety field&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Popular British evolutionist Richard Dawkins is in South Africa to promote a love of science. He spoke to Lesley Cowling</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THERE are few things eminent scientist and Oxford don Richard Dawkins doesn't know. One of them is that he's an Aries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it would be more correct to say he doesn't want to know. &quot;Astronomy is the rightful proprietor of the stars and their wonder -astrology gets in the way, even subverts and debauches the wonder,&quot; he argued during a speech at the Foundation for Research Development (FRD) in Pretoria recently, in which he attacked the current popularity of psychic phenomena and new age thinking, along with more traditional religious beliefs, as &quot;drivel&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Impatience with what he calls &quot;anti-science&quot; and an avowed atheism are among the hallmarks of this popular evolutionary biologist, current holder of the Charles Simonyi Chair for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. But his stern admonishments against &quot;false prophets&quot; and those who &quot;exploit credulous and naive people&quot; notwithstanding, he'll call a truce for a joke in his war against &quot;anti-science&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a matter of principle, I won't answer that question,&quot; he said, smiling, to guests at the FRD function who said there was a bet on about his star sign.  &quot;But I will tell you my date of birth and you can work it out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sense of humour, which includes the ability to laugh at himself, is not the only attractive quality of a man who, on first impression, seems intimidatingly serious and unlikely to suffer fools gladly. There is also the passionate fervour with which he talks of the marvels of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passion seems so unscientific, after all, and mystery even more so, but for Dawkins these qualities are at the heart of scientific endeavour. &quot;I think the appetite for mystery, the enthusiasm for what we don't understand, is healthy and to be fostered. It is the same appetite which drives the best of true science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He quotes a saying by Einstein, a scientist so loved by the masses that he made it into Hollywood and on to T-shirts: &quot;The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most persuasive to his argument of the wonders of science are examples he has culled from science itself, beautifully packaged into bite-sized analogies we can understand and which yet amaze us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From evolution, he offers the intricate workings of DNA, describing it as a document, a dictionary of 64 words, a recipe to make a human being that goes back 35-million centuries. &quot;The messages that have come down to us are the ones that have survived millions, in some cases hundreds of millions of generations. For every successful message that has reached the present, countless have fallen away like the chippings on a sculptor's floor. We are the descendants of a tiny elite of successful ancestors. Our DNA has proved itself successful, because it is here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offers this on the brain: &quot;It's a three-dimensional maze of a million million nerve cells, each one drawn out like a wire to carry pulsed messages.  If you laid all your brain cells end to end, they'd stretch around the world 25 times.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also throws in some did-you-knows that would shame a Chappies bubblegum wrapping. &quot;Every time you drink a glass of water, you are probably imbibing at least one atom that passed through the bladder of Aristotle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appetite for wonder that Dawkins has in abundance and tries to ese emergent properties that have come from large nervous systems, and ed in others is, in itself, a curious anomaly in the evolution of human creatures.  It comes from consciousness, that indefinable thing we have that compels us to reflect on ourselves and others. Consciousness is not really useful, in the evolutionary sense. It can even be a hindrance to human happiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a riddle that any evolutionist has to face -it's another of y it needs explaining. But I don't even know what kind of explanation we're looking for. It's such an elusive phenomenon. Each one of us knows we have it ... But it's hard to know what you're trying to explain if you can't even define it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another problem of evolution he would like to see explained is sex: do we reproduce that way, rather than simply cloning ourselves? ct &quot;Something like aphids, or stick insects -the females are perfectly capable of giving birth to exact copies of themselves, without the intervention of a male, and from a selfish gene point of view, that's, on the face of it, twice as good, because the daughter has all your genes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advantage of sex, he explains, has got to be a simply colossal in medicine has proved. one to overcome the advantage of asexual cloning. &quot; That's why it's a big riddle -a lot of evolutionary theorists are working on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's a short step from consciousness to belief systems, and from there to religion. Dawkins acknowledges that belief itself can be helpful, and can play a role in people curing themselves, as the placebo ssarily mean that God or other supernatural forces exist. He doesn't &quot;It</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wouldn't surprise me if you could by psychological means get rid of ulcers, for example, and religion might well come into that. I don't know whether it would be a faith healer or a psychiatrist talking to you or reading soothing poetry. There are all kinds of things that could happen, and certainly religion could be among those things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doesn't surprise me to learn there are certain kinds of stress-related diseases that religious people are less susceptible to than non-religious people. But of course that says nothing about the truth of those beliefs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawkins argues that just because a belief in God can cure you doesn't the theatre of awe, invoking the same wonder that our early danger of rule out the possibility, but requires scientific proof before he is prepared, himself, to believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a conundrum for a man who, on one hand, is charged with making science popular, and on the other, feels so strongly opposed to the religious, almost as if he has a duty to fight it. Science is in most is losing the sympathy of ordinary mortals when it attacks our most cherished beliefs, the values we live by and the dreams that give life meaning. When Dawkins goes on the attack, he is in that perilous territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But when he's in full descriptive flight on the marvels of the world, stival in Grahamstown, which he kicked off on Wednesday with his lecture ancestors felt when they looked up at the stars and felt the need to weave stories about them, creating myth. Then he's on safe ground, because there he will never lose us.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The SACP and ANC are at loggerheads over the shape of South Africa's new democracy, writes Hein Marais</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IF political alliances were marriages, the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party (SACP) would be in counselling today, poring disconsolately over a new text that aches with unhappiness and disillusionment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text appears in the SACP's journal, African Communist. And it reads like a flurry of left-hooks to the ANC's chin. Written by SACP deputy chair Blade Nzimande and deputy secretary general Jeremy Cronin, it seems to ask &quot; Is this really the same partner we betrothed four decades ago?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its target is an ANC discussion document released last year, The State and Social Transformation, which Nzimande and Cronin describe as a &quot;radical and curious shift&quot; from previous ANC thinking.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Slamming its &quot;opportunism&quot; and its &quot;slide into a technocratic, 'class- neutral' approach to politics&quot;, they accuse it of &quot;abandoning transformation of existing power realities&quot; and of promoting a &quot;passive, regulatory pragmatism&quot; which &quot;can only serve to legitimise and entrench ... inequalities&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With dismay, they note that the ANC document &quot;polemically exhorts workers not to be 'economistic', not to be 'infantile' or 'subjectivist' &quot; while &quot;it hardly prescribes to capitalists at all&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the sort of tiff that tends to have pundits eyeing an imminent split through the prism of drained beer mugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC document sought to sweeten recent government policies like the Growth, Employment and Redistribution strategy (Gear) with a leftish gloss, arguing that the local and international balance of forces allowed no other option.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I welcome its existence,&quot; Cronin said this week, explaining that it was the &quot;first attempt to theorise these unfolding realities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's nothing worse than dealing with an animal whose footprints you can see, but which itself remains invisible&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he insisted that his and Nzimande's foray was aimed not at &quot;some huge showdown&quot; but &quot;at a trend in the ANC, at a powerful tendency in it&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Still, it's a risky intervention, given the SACP's post-1994 experience of tugging, covertly and somewhat forlornly, at the ANC's apron-strings. All the more so, when one discovers that the ANC document was nominally penned by an aide to Mbeki. It's safe to assume that it reflected Mbeki's thinking, even if he did concur with criticisms levelled at it in a SACP central committee meeting last October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, it's no surprise to discover that the essay's stridency -and the chance that it could be construed as a personal assault on Mbeki -has triggered some anxiety in the SACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, the ANC document -and its close correspondence to government policies and processes -has already thrown down the gauntlet to the SACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Either it tags along in the wake of policies and trends that contradict its vision of transformation. Or it tries to render less opaque the contesting agendas and interests that are uneasily submerged in a pool of makeshift harmony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nzimande and Cronin's essay recognises this. Coming from within a party which has preferred to pursue its disagreements with the ANC behind closed doors, this is strong stuff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what does it all add up to? The pat reaction is that the alliance is fast approaching its expiry date. But there's much more afoot here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This doesn't mean that one accepts the ANC's sanguine response that the essay be seen merely &quot;in the context of discussions on various policy positions between the ANC and SACP&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it resonates at two levels -political drama (inducing reveries of strife and splits) and revitalised political analysis and strategy. Believe it or not, the real story lies with the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thinking arrayed by Nzimande and Cronin is an unexpectedly courageous and polemical outgrowth from a 1996 SACP strategy document, Let us not lose sight of our strategic priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There, the party noted that the &quot;national democratic forces represent complex, quite dynamic, shifting realities, which are liable to coalesce around two distinct versions of the national democratic project&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first would seek to advance the interests of the poor via an actively allied &quot;developmental state&quot; and &quot;broad, popular movement&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second, paraded under the motto of &quot;realism&quot;, would orbit around themes of modernisation, normalisation, globalisation, social unity, and law and order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here the SACP detected &quot;a potential, new ruling bloc in formation ...  including, in practice, both major fractions of the old (white) bourgeoisie and new, emergent capitalist fractions&quot;. The latter, it warned, would &quot; conceal their dependency on the 'modernising' white fraction of the bourgeoisie with a great deal of rhetoric about 'the need for a patriotic bourgeoisie' &quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What this analysis recognised was that the ANC's ascent to political power coincided with an intensified struggle over which set of social, economic and political forces would constitute a new ruling bloc. The ongoing contest over economic policies, the labour market and the social bias of development initiatives are part and parcel of that battle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the key propellants of the negotiations process was the realisation among sections of the old ruling bloc that the capitalist system in South Africa had to be &quot;modernised&quot; -in economic and political terms. We had to become a &quot;normal&quot; capitalist society. Despite its haphazard reform efforts of the 1980s, the National Party administration had proved manifestly unequal to that task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alternative was risky but not prohibitively so: it meant democratising the political system and gradually forging a new ruling bloc, with a severely circumscribed or even dismembered ANC eventually serving as its political axis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SACP might recoil from so crass an exposition, but its current thinking recognises that the ANC is, at once, an agent and subject in this process.  Likewise, the organised, skilled working class which, through regressive changes to the labour market, might find itself perforce appended to a new ruling bloc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far from having dissolved into a fraternity of common purpose, tranquillised by the levelling language of nation-building, we are in the midst of an intense, renewed struggle. The outcome will determine which interests and ideals determine the course of the new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Nzimande and Cronin have risked is to point out that already ossifying within the ANC are trends that ally it to an agenda which conflicts fundamentally with the interests and aspirations of the majority of South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The neo-liberal features of the Gear macro-economic strategy, the elitist nature of many black economic empowerment ventures, and the supine postures struck before the demands of corporate South Africa are, in such a reading, not anomalies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If left unchecked, the result will be a revised division of society, with the current order stabilised around, at best, 30% of the population. For the rest -overwhelmingly young, female and black -the best hope will be &quot;some trickle-down from a 'modernised' and 'normalised' new South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This raises not only moral but political problems. &quot;The newly arrived&quot;, the SACP warned, will increasingly view &quot;the excluded 70% as a threat to newly acquired privilege and power&quot; -which brings the danger of a new authoritarianism in response to social instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Politically, the aim of Nzimande and Cronin's polemic is to galvanise the simmering disquiet in ANC and alliance ranks into progressive challenge, ahead of the ANC's December national conference. But the intervention might snag on a few problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision to obliquely address Mbeki himself might backfire. Mbeki personifies the trend of technocratic realism railed against by Nzimande and Cronin. He is our version of Brazil's President Henrique Cardoso, a manager of social compromises. The authors seem to hope that this approach has been wrought less by conviction than by circumstance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a government obsessed with sending the &quot;right signals&quot; to investors will find itself hard-pressed to confirm that it has steeled itself against attempts to push its policies in a more popular direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within the ANC leadership there will be calls to shut the door on the SACP, by shielding policy-making even further from input by alliance partners (and even from key ANC structures themselves).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, like the ANC, the SACP is itself divided on these matters.  Coursing through it are three broad currents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weaned on a diet of blunted political theory is a rump of largely unreconstructed &quot;traditionalists&quot; who are, in equal measure, angered and dumbfounded by the post-1994 drift of the ANC. Ascendant is a loose grouping of neo-Marxists (Cronin, Nzimande, SACP national organiser Langa Zita, and the National Union of Metal Workers's Enoch Godongwana among them), who are keenly pursuing a strategic and organisational revival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there is a powerful array of &quot;realists&quot; (exemplified by Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin) who argue that global realities preclude an overtly popular path towards transformation, at least for now. Like the ebb and flow of the tides, it is not easy to discern where one ends and the other begins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Complicating matters is a lack of unanimity over continuing the alliance in its current form. Provisionally, the consensus is to redefine the party &quot;in the context of an ANC-led alliance&quot;. But as the SACP's 1996 document admitted, &quot;there is a debate in our party about the wisdom of this&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the challenges thrown to the ANC inevitably will also cause shudders within the SACP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All of which is to the good. Not simply because, like regular exercise, &quot; debate is healthy&quot;. But because this intervention might help distil from the mush of enforced consensus and muted disquiet the rapidly crystallising pockets of interests and ideological difference within the ANC, particularly, and the alliance, broadly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exactly where it's supposed to lead is unclear. A split is not on the cards, but the recasting of the terms of the alliance might well be. One attractive option would be a push to create platforms within the ANC, along the lines of Brazil's Workers' Party, in order to enable the clear expression and pursuit of divergent interests. For an organisation as ideologically elastic as the ANC this poses no threat of implosion. Rather it could place the organisation on a more genuinely democratic footing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the outcome, Nzimande and Cronin have taken the plunge and said outright what many have long known: that corralling divergent interests under the canopy of coerced unity threatens South Africa's transformation, and that, trite as it sounds, a struggle does continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalist and researcher Hein Marais's book, South Africa: The Political- Economy of Transformation, is being published soon by Zed Books</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dear Walter,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CRIME is beginning to get to me. You will have seen the latest developments: Gary Player threatening to take the gold-plated number plates off his Rolls Royce if the caddies pinching his golf balls are not hanged on sight; various rabbis threatening to take to the streets if Moshe Dayan is not immediately appointed commander-in-chief of the South African Police Service with powers to bulldoze suspects' homes ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yesterday I borrowed a copy of Crime and Punishment from the Houghton library in search of tips for Sidney Mufamadi and settled down to study it over my evening cup of cocoa. Discovering it was nothing more than an everyday tale of granny-bashing I must have dozed off. The next thing I knew there was a horrendous crash as a brick came hurtling through the window, followed by an apparition masked by a balaclava and brandishing a revolver.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I asked him sternly what he thought he was doing. He said impatiently, as he clambered with much puffing and panting over the window ledge, that he was burgling my house. I attempted to remonstrate with him, pointing out the effect this sort of activity had on social stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What choice did he have, he demanded indignantly, rummaging through my desk drawers. Every time he was caught the magistrate granted him bail, which necessitated another burglary to pay off the requisite loan. &quot;It's a treadmill,&quot; he said aggrievedly. &quot;Heavens knows what will happen when they eventually convict me; how am I going to pay for my escape with the proceeds from this junk?&quot; he demanded, critically examining my Robben Island long- service medal before tossing it into his swag bag.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Realising that I was dealing with a man deaf to the voice of reason, I took advantage of his distraction -while he rifled through my Valentine collection with loud whistles -to press the panic button. A few minutes later I was relieved to hear the approaching wail of a police siren. But the thief made no attempt to flee, calmly proceeding to unhook from the wall my priceless Portrait of a Dead Penguin (Corporal Gregory in the style of Titian).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next moment the door to my study crashed open and in charged none other than Sydney and Commissioner George Fivaz. &quot;A burglar,&quot; I warned, pointing at my intruder. &quot;Arrest that man,&quot; shouted Sydney at George. &quot;Political interference!&quot; bawled George in objection, coming to a abrupt halt. &quot;The Police Act of 1995 clearly lays out the prerogative of the commissioner ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hang on to this,&quot; said the burglar, handing his revolver over to Sydney. &quot; Watch out,&quot; he said to Fivaz, who muttered an apology and stepped aside to allow him to roll up my Persian rug.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You signed a contract guaranteeing due performance,&quot; protested Sydney to George. &quot;I had my fingers crossed,&quot; retorted a beaming George.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well cheerio,&quot; said the burglar, clambering out the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hey, you forgot your gun,&quot; shouted Sydney through the window.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don't worry, they're two-a-penny,&quot; the desperado's voice came floating back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I pinched myself confidently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But I wasn't dreaming.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Teachers' unions are disenchanted with government measures that have led to an exodus from the profession, writes Philippa Garson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The writing's on the proverbial chalkboard: tough times lie ahead for teachers left behind after 15 000 of their best have been paid tens of millions of rands to stop teaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many have breathed easy at the lack of strikes and protests by teachers over the past couple of years. The Education Labour Relations Council (ELRC), set up in 1995, was -and still is -lauded as the answer to labour unrest in the teaching corps. The ELRC has bestowed legitimate labour rights on all teachers, granting them proper channels to air their grievances so they don't --thank God -resort to &quot;chalk downs&quot; and abandon their classrooms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But lately there are signs that the honeymoon is drawing to a close, with teachers' unions recently walking out of talks with the government in the ELRC. Unions are growing impatient with the &quot;mature bargaining&quot; they say has translated into false promises. The directive from the finance department is: if you want to pay your teachers well, then accept there will be fewer of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Increasingly, there are signs that the Sword of Damocles hanging over the rest of the public service in an era of right-sizing and fiscal discipline, is also going to fall on teachers. The 380 000 teachers comprise a significant section of the 1,2-million-strong public service and slot in at a relatively high level on the broad banded public service salary scale. They consume 25%, the largest chunk of the annual R58-billion public service wage bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unions say the government has reneged on key agreements struck in the ELRC, notably Resolution Three of 1996, which gave teachers significant salary increases and pledged further increases for the next three years. It has become clear that there were &quot;trade-offs&quot; in the agreement teachers' unions and government signed -trade-offs which the unions were blithely unaware of at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already the government's redeployment strategy has been dubbed by angry unionists and teachers as a betrayal -&quot;nothing but retrenchment through the back door&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, very few teachers have been redeployed. There is a growing realisation that teachers can't be &quot;pushed around like chess pieces&quot;, as educationist Rosamund Jaff from the National Business Initiative (NBI) put it.  &quot;Most have families. They are not mobile. The government has gambled that in today's economy, teachers cannot afford not to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One government official admitted that more of a &quot;stick&quot; and less of a &quot; carrot&quot; approach may be used to get teachers to move to posts far from their families. However, it may just be that those who don't take voluntary severance packages, or can no longer get them, will be retrenched. &quot;What was going to be redeployment is increasingly likely to become retrenchment when we need the best teachers for the new curriculum,&quot; said Jaff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many schools are simply freezing posts. Provinces implemented the ELRC agreement as a cost-slashing exercise, with scant regard to which teachers were opting for the voluntary severance packages. The biggest teacher union - the South African Democratic Teachers' Union (Sadtu)-expected the packages to be offered to teachers as a &quot;privilege&quot;, not a &quot;right&quot;, to those surplus teachers who could not move to other schools. Instead the packages were granted left, right and centre, before redeployment had even started. Now an unconscionable amount of money has been lavished on packages, draining the system of 15 000 of the most experienced teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sadtu, struggling to reposition itself in an era where its ideological allies -and many of its former leaders -are in government, is fast having to learn how not to be a sweetheart union. Sadtu has had to abandon ideology and embark on a crash course in combat. &quot;The question of cut-backs is seriously undermining transformation,&quot; said general secretary Thulas Nxesi. &quot;The government argues that 20% of the budget allocated to education is high. But South Africa has no infrastructure for the majority of people. We have to build more classrooms and train thousands of teachers who are not yet up to scratch. In addition, we have to retrain teachers to cope with the challenges of the new curriculum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the salary issue is something of a Catch-22 situation given that the teacher wage bill swallows 80% of the education budget. Jane Hofmeyr, also of the NBI, argues that a too powerful ELRC could impact badly on education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Salary increases will mean cut-backs on other expenditure -textbooks and new classrooms, for example. We will have fewer teachers who are paid relatively high salaries and the education system will suffer as a result.  And no one is facing up to the inevitable trade-offs,&quot; said Hofmeyr, who also criticised the &quot;incentive&quot; encouraging teachers to study for an extra year which will give teachers an additional R10000 per annum for a fourth year of study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In four years there will be serious problems with the size of the wage bill,&quot; she said, recalling words of warning from an educationist with international experience: &quot;Contain the salary bill otherwise the quality of education will decline.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THREE films due to have been screened at the Weekly Mail Festival of South African Cinema have been banned at the last minute by the Publications Control Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are: Choosing for Justice, Hugh Cassirer and Nadine Gordimer's film about Allan Boesak and his role in the resistance to the institutionalised social violence, racism and injustice; Reasonable Men, a &quot;political&quot; music video featuring the Kalahari Surfers and a confused PW Botha being suffocated by the national flag, by Robyn Aronstam and Neria Cohen; and No Middle Road to Freedom, Kevin Harris's documentary dealing with the history of the African National Congress and reflecting on violent tensions in the polarised South African community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the festival organisers will appeal the censor's decision as a matter of urgency, which may mean that these films will still be screened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban has been greeted with bewilderment by the film community as all three films have been shown previously at other festivals in Durban and Cape Town. -The Weekly Mail, April 10 to 16 1987</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Cheers, Pallo</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IT'S good to know our Environmental Affairs and Tourism Minister, Pallo Jordan, can say no to the temptations of the flesh. KWV, which is having a spot of bother with farming Minister Derek Hanekom, wrote to Pallo telling him he was on the KWV courtesy list and offered him huge discounts on wine.  But, KWV warned him, this &quot;concession&quot; should not be abused or the privilege would be &quot;summarily withdrawn&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pallo, who used to enjoy a dop or two a few years back, told KWV to stick its cheapo vino where the monkey puts its nuts. He told KWV it should be horse-whipped in the club for saying wine-sniffer John Platter was lying about appalling conditions endured by workers on some Cape farms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe takes to shopping</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* THERE are weighty matters on President Robert Mugabe's mind these days.  Shopping is big on his agenda since he married local lass Grace Marufu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he and 38 in the presidential party returned from an official visit to Europe, they checked in a staggering seven tons of luggage between them. And the hard-pressed national carrier, Air Zimbabwe, didn't charge overweight.  Not a single bulging suitcase went through the anything-to-declare route at Harare customs. The trailers carrying the weighty loot were hauled around the side of the airport building to the waiting Benzes outside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Licence to audit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* PETRO-CHEMICAL spy-catcher Penuell Maduna has finally asked the auditor general to examine two Egyptian oil contracts, a fortnight after a preliminary probe by Maduna's own auditing team led to the suspension of state oil chief Kobus van Zyl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auditor general's office asked for a meeting with Maduna after the minister's officials openly panned its auditing of the accounts of the Central Energy Fund, the body responsible for outwitting the United Nation's oil sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maduna suspended Van Zyl weeks after he hired struggle accountants Ntsaluba Nkonki Sizwe to investigate the fund's sanctions-busting contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killing roads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* SOUTH AFRICANS know all about carnage on the roads. We managed to kill about 300 on the roads this Easter, up a bit on last year. But consider the terrible situation in New Zealand. Easter road deaths have doubled from 1996.  From one to two. Wow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best of British news</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* GOD Save the Queen is the latest tune being hummed along the cheery corridors of the SABC. If it wasn't for the BBC, SABC radio would be unable to give its listeners soundbites from any foreign country. The nearly bankrupt SABC has ditched Sapa, the local wire service, saying it can't afford it and doesn't need it (except for sport). The SABC says it already has the biggest and best news service in the country, its own. And the SABC says, it also already has a wire service, Reuters, which is British. Then, it also has the BBC. Wait for plenty of news items beginning: &quot;In Bournemouth today ...&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - 'Science has given to this generation the means of unlimited disaster, or of unlimited progress,&quot; said Winston Churchill. We now know what he means, courtesy of Professor Barry Komisaruk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The professor and his team of researchers at Rutgers University in the United States this week announced the discovery of a chemical in the body which produces the female climax -prompting speculation that an &quot;orgasm pill&quot; will be with us (or, rather, with the fairer half of humanity) within a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Komisaruk postulates that his discovery might be exploited to produce painkillers. It will certainly be one hell of a way to cure a hangover. Not to mention a telling response to the time-honoured excuse: &quot;I've got a headache, darling ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the professor appears not to have fully seized upon the magnitude of his achievement -and the potential it has for good and evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It begins with himself. Presumably, in the tradition of modern medical researchers -who have tried to claim copyright on man's genetic map -he has patented his find. If so, what price a man who can guarantee the world's entire female population an orgasm on demand?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The discovery also, obviously, has implications for (gender-specific) mankind. Taken in conjunction with cloning, it raises the question as to whether he has any purpose left in life. On the other hand, it does provide a means to overcome one of the burdens of polygamy; after Sunday's roast he can now just distribute the pill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But those who find mass-produced, chemically induced orgasms distasteful can take comfort in the words of Bertrand Russell: &quot;Civilised people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Love me, love my pill?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The row between National Commissioner George Fivaz and Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi is farcical and - entertainment value aside -intolerable. Sympathy must lie to a limited degree with the minister at the moment, if only because we share his frustration at the continued incompetence of the police in dealing with crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fivaz always looked like a makeshift appointment, plucked from some back- room of systems management and thrust into the frontline, not because he had any obvious leadership qualities, but because there was no one else of like seniority who was untainted by a security branch past.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His performance has been woefully inadequate, marked more by risible gimmick than by inspiration. Remember South Africa's 10 000 &quot;Most Wanted&quot; he planned to round up in a month? Ha, Ha. The lie-detector programme to which all senior officers were going to subject themselves? Ho, Ho. The plan to hire a private security company to guard police headquarters because they were incapable of doing it themselves? That one had the audience bracing themselves for the punch-line and sure enough it came ... when thieves trundled an 800kg automatic teller machine out of the Wachthuis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would all be side-splitting stuff, were it not for the destructive effects where our society is concerned. This week we have had the correspondent of that most prestigious of international finance magazines, The Economist, trussed up in her home at gunpoint. How's that for a signal to foreign investors?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And then there is the haemorrhaging of some of the brightest and the best among young South Africans. Like one outstanding lawyer who is heading for Britain this month with her family after a hideously traumatic hijacking which saw gunmen taunting her with the life of her baby son. The incident took place in the driveway of the communications director of the South African Police Service, an otherwise delicious irony robbed of any humour both by the horror of the moment and the tragedy to South Africa represented by their departure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, if Fivaz is a natural target for frustrations over the crime problem, the truth is that no one is sure where responsibility truly belongs. What about Mufamadi himself? The minister says that if Fivaz chooses to go he will not stand in his way -a phrase redolent of lack of purpose. The only purposeful move we have seen Mufamadi make is his attempt to tie police commanders down to a &quot;due performance&quot; contract. That's about as much help as Steve Tshwete demanding Clive Barker sign a contract guaranteeing Bafana Bafana will win the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer to crime is not getting rid of the commissioner -at least not now. The answer lies in gaining an understanding of the problem. And we can see no better way to do that than to establish a full-blown judicial commission of inquiry into the police. It should be headed by a high court judge and assisted by foreign experts on policing. Together they can bring a much-needed, judicious and impartial eye to bear on the country's most intractable problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lubumbashi - Rebels seized Zaire's second-largest city, Lubumbashi, on Wednesday to be greeted by tumultuous applause as hordes of people welcomed them as liberators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall of the city left President Mobutu Sese Seko scrambling to retain what is left of his crumbling power by imposing a de facto military government even as the United States went public with an extraordinarily open condemnation of their former close ally. &quot;Mobutuism is about to become a creature of history,&quot; said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">US support for the rebels has been an open secret for months, but this week the White House said bluntly that President Mobutu Sese Seko should leave power because support for him was insufficient to lead Zaire &quot;into the next chapter of its history&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In what appeared a desperate last attempt to exert his authority Mobutu dismissed his old foe, Etienne Tshisekedi, as prime minister on the same day the rebels took Lubumbashi -the very day he was to have taken office.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the day security forces in Kinshasa fired in the air and used teargas against thousands of Tshisekedi supporters who turned out to accompany him to the prime minister's offices to instal his new government team. Security forces had blocked off the office complex with troops and armoured vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshisekedi, his eyes streaming from the teargas, had set off on foot for the offices surrounded by his supporters. Security forces fired in the air and fired teargas grenades after the crowd burst through an initial security cordon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said that Mobutu's son, Kongolo, a presidential guard officer known in Kinshasa as &quot;Saddam Hussein&quot; after the Iraqi leader, had escorted Tshisekedi back home. Tshisekedi was bleeding from a wound to the head, one aide said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his place, the president imposed a military man, the former defence minister General Likulia Bolongo. His appointment, on the heels of a state of emergency which gave the army direct administration of those provinces still in government hands, may have been the military's condition for continuing to fight. But it is likely to prove a futile gesture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the fall of Lubumbashi, the regime retains real control of little more than Kinshasa and large areas of rainforest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several hours of artillery fire on Lubumbashi's outskirts, which cleared the city centre in a matter of minutes as residents scurried for their homes, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo- Zaire launched its assault. Government forces did not put up significant resistance. One unit simply abandoned its barracks and ran. Gunfire continued through the day until the rebels had taken control of most of Lubumbashi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the rebels moved into the city, a single chant swept across Lubumbashi: &quot; Kabila, Kabila&quot;, the name of the rebel leader, Laurent Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the city was immensely relieved at the rebels' arrival, which residents had expected for days. Crowds of people took over the military headquarters to clap and whistle in support of the insurgents, even while fighting continued close by. Many tore strips of white cloth from sheets and rolled-up white towels to wrap around their heads to reaffirm their support for the rebels. In their enthusiasm, some young men jumped into the back of rebels' vehicles saying they would join the fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Suddenly everyone has always been against Mobutu. Suddenly everyone found the courage to denounce him. Sammy Toassa, sporting the obligatory makeshift headband, struggled to express his contempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We don't ever want to think of Mobutu again. We hope he burns in hell, or worse. But what could be worse? Now we are liberated by our brother Kabila,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not everyone was so confident of the rebels. As they swung into sight, one elegantly dressed young woman ripped off her earrings and gold chain, saying she feared they would be stolen. Shortly afterwards the jewels were back in place and she was chatting happily to one of the insurgents dressed in a black beret, olive fatigues and Wellington boots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels did not have a lot to say but what they did revealed some to be Swahili-speaking Tutsis who have grown up in Tanzania or Uganda as exiles from Rwanda, reinforcing the evidence that Zaire's neighbours are backing the Alliance. The crowd did not care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while there was an immense relief at getting rid of a grim regime which for most Zaireans is the only one they have ever known, people looked mystified when asked what it is they expect from the rebels. Eventually someone chirped up their hopes for democracy. Another said jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appollos Mufunga got into the swing of things. &quot;The people hope for better lives and freedom, and more money to spend. That's what they have in Goma and Bukavu and other places liberated by the rebels,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufunga is mistaken. In many ways, life remains as hard in rebel-held areas as it always was and the Alliance has shown a streak as authoritarian as Mobutu's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Lubumbashi this week it was as if a huge burden had been lifted after the rising tensions of recent days as frightened government troops became increasingly abusive, beating up suspected rebel sympathisers and extorting money at gunpoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food was hard to come by for poor residents. Almost no new deliveries came into the city, most shops were closed and the prices of what was available rose steeply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those who welcomed the rebels was a group of Italian nuns looking after homeless teenage girls. They have been living in terror for days, fearing that undisciplined government troops would repeat the rapes and murders which have become a hallmark of their retreats elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't slept properly in days. Every little noise in the night terifies us. We've heard the tales of the nuns who were raped by the army in the north. God knows what they will do to us. We just want this to be over,&quot; said Sister Maria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the fighting began, many government troops fled into the city centre and hijacked cars in the hope of making their escape. Senior officers could be seen fleeing towards the airport, about 6km miles away. But some government soldiers fought back. Rebel wounded were carried from the front- line which shifted rapidly around corners and down streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels launched their assault after positioning troops on at least two sides of the city after seizing the town of Likasi, two hours' drive north of Lubumbashi, and Kipushi, 30km to the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main resistance was put up by Mobutu's personal regiment, the Special Presidential Division (DSP) which claimed to have beaten off the rebels just two days ago. But the DSP was increasingly isolated and nervous as units of the regular army went over to the rebels or refused to fight, and most of the city's civilian population openly sided with the Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DSP was left with almost no means of escape other than the surrounding bush, where they are likely to be hunted down, or heading several hundred kilometres for the Angolan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before the rebel assault the army scrambled to boost its manpower by press-ganging young men into uniform. A forlorn bunch was lined up outside the military headquarters, but their reluctance to fight was obvious. When soldiers at a nearby road block opened fire after a car failed to stop, some of the conscripts took the opportunity to flee in the chaos.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Namibian President Sam Nujoma has given his clearest signal yet that he will stand for a third term as head of state, despite the fact that the Constitution limits the incumbent to two terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told Parliament last week: &quot;I am still young and if the people of Namibia want me to continue making a contribution I will continue to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was responding to a question from Democratic Coalition of Namibia leader, Moses Katjiuongua, as to whether he would follow Nelson Mandela's example and give clear notice of his intention to stand down to ensure a stable handover.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You can see the difference between me and President Nelson Mandela,&quot; the 67-year old Nujoma said, to the sound vigorous table thumbing from MPs from the ruling party, the South West African People's Organisation (Swapo).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Expectations that the third term would become a fait accompli hardened when a Swapo council last month called on him to serve as president &quot;as long as he was medically fit&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is now expected that Swapo's congress, due in May, will endorse the proposal, paving the way for the party to use its parliamentary majority to push through a constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At present, article 29 of the Constitution limits the president to a maximum of two five-year terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma's words have set off alarm bells among the opposition, human rights groups, and Western diplomats, who have criticised Nujoma for making the third term an issue of age, rather than constitutional principle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Society for Human Rights said in a statement: &quot;It is not the age of a president but the constitutional provisions and restrictions which matter. If this was not the case then United States President Bill Clinton would remain in power until he reaches the age of Nelson Mandela.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of former Swapo members detained by the movement in exile, called on Nujoma to drop his commitment to a third term and instead promote the importance of Article 29 of the Constitution to ensure a smooth handover of presidential powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Breaking the Wall of Silence group, Samson Ndeikwila, said it was a myth that Namibia has nobody capable of taking over from Nujoma.  &quot;The truth is that there are people in Namibia who can and will perform the same or even better than President Nujoma.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An unnamed European diplomat told The Namibian newspaper that Nujoma's intention to stand again was &quot;very worrying,&quot; as Namibia had been regarded as a democratic role model.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nujoma's announcement was made without consultation with other leading figures in Swapo, according to party insiders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite concern within Swapo's top echelons about Nujoma's unilateral decision, no one is expected to break ranks and oppose the proposed change to the Constitution at next month's party congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many members of Swapo are luke-warm about a third term for Nujoma, but feel it would avoid ugly in-fighting between possible successors, which may open up ethnic tensions within the party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The son of super-surgeon Dr Chris Barnard and a member of the Meerlust wine dynasty are to join Boss Models's top overseas operation, swelling the ranks of the blue-blooded and beautiful strutting on world catwalks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Barnard, who joined Boss Models's Cape Town business last year, is to fly to New York next month, while George van Reenen, scion of Meerlust's Myburgh family, goes in November. New York is the launchpad for Boss Models' new supermodels.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barnard, the son of his father's second marriage to Barbara, has been a model since 1992. He ditched a career in advertising for the Boss stable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father is said not to be overjoyed about his career choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What does being a supermodel mean to me?&quot; the 23-year-old Barnard says. &quot; Better quality of life, but money is not an issue. I think beauty comes from within.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Reenen says he sees Boss as a &quot;stepping stone&quot;. The 22-year-old student at Stellenbosch University has already modelled for Versace and Perry Ellis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ascent of the two is symptomatic of the fashion industry's current penchant for &quot;aristocratic&quot; models -such as Stella Tennant, who is related to the British royal family.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their allure plays on the imagination of the industry,&quot; says Michael Gross, author of Models: The Ugly Business of Beautiful Women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no better way to sell a high-end product than with a high-end girl.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barnard says he was attracted to modelling because of the &quot;showbiz&quot; aspect.  &quot;In a way, I've always been in the spotlight,&quot; he adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You wouldn't be doing this interview now if it wasn't for my name, let's face it. But I'm not resentful and I'm very proud of my father. I'm not sure exactly how he feels about it. He's not 100% sure about modelling being the right way to go. But my mother and stepfather support me completely.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds he would &quot;never appear nude or do anything to offend my girlfriend like kissing another girl, or to make my family uncomfortable&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Johannesburg's public defenders turn to gallows humour at the coalface of justice, reports Mungo Soggot</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The stench of urine in Court 20 of the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court was so powerful that the court orderly reluctantly opened the large windows to the chilly afternoon air. The smell was seeping up from the cells below, from where John Meyer emerged chained at the ankles to face his murder trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer allegedly stabbed a man to death with an ivory-handled hunting knife during a brawl over a cigarette. The only witness in the case, which resumes later this month, is a R40-a-day police informer. The same informer landed him in court last year on robbery charges that were dismissed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meyer is being represented by Aysha Ismail, one of South Africa's 10 public defenders -defence lawyers paid by the state. Without them Meyer would have stood a good chance of going unrepresented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The money is not good: a public defender's starting salary is R67 000 a year. They need a strong dedication to justice to help Johannesburg's innumerable penniless criminals desperate for a free lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The criminal litigators work with some of the most sordid aspects of South African justice. At their morning meeting public defender Nic du Toit, formerly the head of a prison, recounts how another lawyer complained that his client had been raped in the cells at Bedfordview police station. &quot;Rape is standard procedure. You get arrested, you often get raped,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all have to develop a graveyard sense of humour. Otherwise we wouldn't survive,&quot; says Carol Bruyns, a senior public defender.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By 10am, Vivian Fortunat, the office's other senior public defender, had dealt with five matters in a frenetic tour of the courts. She expected to make one actual appearance -to defend one of two men charged with robbing a tourist at knifepoint in central Johannesburg. But the case was number four on the list, so was not due to start until mid-morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunat walked briskly to an adjacent courtroom and shouted: &quot;Siphiwe Shongwe.&quot; No answer. She turned to the court prosecutor to say, &quot;My client didn't show ... you'll have to get a warrant,&quot; before belting down the corridor. On her way she ran into another client charged with beating to death, while in a drunken rage, his cousin's husband for &quot;fiddling&quot; with his wife. Fortunat told her hunched and anxious client there was nothing to worry about. &quot;All the witnesses are either dead or nuts,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later she explained the man's wife was abroad and his cousin in an asylum. &quot; They can't even prove that there were four people in the house. All they can prove is that there is one deceased.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunat popped into Court 10 to check whether her robbery case was nearer the top of the roll, but a magistrate known for his pedantry still had three other matters to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another courtroom a client had not turned up while another client in the neighbouring court had managed to pay for a private attorney. That client was charged with attempting to sell stolen property despite being deaf and dumb. &quot; How could my client have arranged to sell anything? He's deaf and dumb. Even the prosecution wanted to know what he was doing in there,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fortunat started as a public defender after a long stint at the attorney general's office. She says many of her colleagues are women -probably because of the pay. Her colleague, Bruyns, adds women are usually attracted to the job because they are more sympathetic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They need their dose of irreverence. Watching a video of a slick American law lecturer on court craft, some giggle when he says lawyers have to believe their clients' stories. &quot;We wouldn't have any work,&quot; Fortunat says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public defender's office was only made permanent last year after being set up in 1992. At present there is only the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court branch, although there are plans for other cities. The budget is administered by the struggling Legal Aid Board. A means test is used for prospective clients, but each public defender has the discretion to be lenient in applying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public defenders pick up the bulk of their cases at Diepkloof prison, south of Johannesburg. The day the Mail &amp; Guardian accompanied one of 15 trainee attorneys who work at the office to Diepkloof, prisoners arrested the previous day had already been shunted off to holding cells. Usually the visiting public defender is given a desk in a spacious cell to handle applications. This time the prison officials took candidate attorney Vanessa Perumal to three filthy, crowded cells where she managed to speak to 12 prisoners and fill out their forms before being ushered out by a stroppy guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'They (the prisoners) are usually so happy to see us,&quot; says the 27-year-old.  &quot;Often these guys don't get their phone call to a lawyer or a relative to pay bail. We are their only link with the outside world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back at the courtroom, Fortunat runs into the client who allegedly robbed a tourist. She races through his version of events on a bench outside the court.  He claims he was caught while running to fetch compact discs from his brother. Another public defender, Merinda Viljoen, glances at the docket and advises Fortunat with a sad laugh: &quot;Just go through the motions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case started late that afternoon in another courtroom, but was immediately postponed for half an hour because the interpreter could not speak Shangaan. Another interpreter was brought in. Asked whether he spoke Shangaan, he said: &quot;Not after lunch.&quot; The case jerked along for 15 minutes before it was 3.30pm and time to go home -or downstairs to the urine-soaked cells and on to the prison's van back to Diepkloof.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government is discussing throwing a R200-million lifeline to safeguard specialist services provided by academic hospitals in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape Health and Social Services MEC, Ebrahim Rasool, said this week talks with the Finance and Health ministries were under way and an announcement about the cash, to be drawn from a newly created central fund, was imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Health Ministry declined to comment ahead of the talks being finalised.  But Rasool said Finance Minister Trevor Manuel had given him permission to disclose the talks, which began two weeks ago, and their positive nature.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my anticipation that the fund will indeed be established, and that we will receive the R200-million needed to save the hospitals,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province's academic hospitals -Groote Schuur, Tygerberg and Red Cross - provide specialist services such as heart and bone-marrow transplants. But their funding has been cut to R830-million for the current year, down R78- million on last year's figure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such cuts could lead to Groote Schuur and Tygerberg alone losing 490 of their total 2 640 beds.Tygerberg's chief medical superintendent, Abdul Rahman, warned the cuts &quot;could have a tremendous effect on the survival of patients&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fund plans follow a report from the London-based consultant King's Fund -employed by Rasool -which said funds were needed for the hospitals before &quot; irreparable damage is done&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasool said without the additional cash, the hospitals would be forced into the &quot;indiscriminate sacking of very marketable people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province's overall health budget has fallen by 9% from last year -by R250-million, to R2,5-billion -in the central government's drive to redress past imbalances in provincial health resources. The drive has also hit Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rasool, referring to his concern that the Western Cape government could divert the funds elsewhere, said he had Finance MEC Kobus Meiring's &quot;personal assurance that the money will indeed be used exclusively for health&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Special writer Ruaridh Nicoll spends 12 hours in the hell halls of Baragwanath Hospital</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday 6.48pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE night-porter waits. Lounging in a wheelchair, he watches as the darkness begins to strangle the eve-ning's flaring sun. At his feet, pools of water from earlier rain stand in the hollows while the tools of his trade, 30 stretchers, lie chaotic around him like flotsam at a breakwater.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He knows that beyond the walls of this vast hospital the harvest has begun, the first of the night's crop of smashed humanity is on its way. He stirs, marking a car's hurried approach along the glistening road.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pulling up, Ruffus Ngxekisa leaves the driver's seat and opens a back door, pulling a bloody mess -a friend -from the vehicle. He turns and looks beyond the porter helping the patient on to a stretcher, into the doorway of the squat barracks which glows yellow with foul light. The porter begins to roll the stretcher towards the door and Ngxekisa follows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like Alice through the looking glass, they arrive in a parallel universe, Chris Hani Baragwanath -the world's largest hospital. A notice on the wall cautions newcomers to stay quiet and wait their turn while trolleys garnished with shuddering bodies stand in line.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man moves among the cut and dazed taking details. A doctor spreads his palms and leans heavily on a patient's chest before he pauses, straightens up and pulls a sheet over the dead man's head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is still early.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He hit a wall, somebody else was driving but they ran,&quot; Ngxekisa says to the man taking notes. &quot;Somebody phoned me because I knew him.&quot; He shrugs and looks down at his friend -all he has ever known is a first name, Jabulani. &quot; The car is in pieces,&quot; he says, explaining all the blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jabulani joins a queue of patients waiting for admission, their stretchers lining up like cars at a tollgate. Beyond, the activity intensifies; the graver the injury, the more a force like gravity pulls the victim into the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They go down the corridor: stitching room to the right of them, orthopaedic pit to the left of them, resuscitation room and the operating theatres in front of them. Possibly into the jaws of death, certainly into the mouth of hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7.53pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A man rages incoherently and a nurse, the milk of human kindness a dried-up stain on her heart, complains tiredly that the patients are always drunk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You don't have to be drunk to fight in this place,&quot; mutters Trevor Herbst, shifting with the pain of five stab wounds. &quot;It was about a lady,&quot; he says of his injuries. &quot;Just a friend of mine. There were two of them, one had a bottle and the other had a knife.&quot; He begins to go pale. &quot;I feel dizzy,&quot; he says, and then more urgently: &quot;Water&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blood seeps along the fibres of his meagre blanket and his skin feels deathly cold to the touch. A nurse arrives, piles him on to a stretcher and feeds a saline drip into him. Looking at the blood seeping from a wound in the back of his neck and another in the small of his back, she quickly rolls him into the stitching room.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.26pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside, nursing auxiliary Sila Mbatha is ready with the scalpel and the crescent needle. The skin of his face looks as if it has been scrunched into a ball and left out to dry in the sun. Using the blade between finger and thumb, he scrapes away Herbst's hair around the head wound, revealing a strong flow of arterial blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pauses and turns Herbst over, pushing his little finger into the wound on his back, causing Herbst to squeal as the finger goes in up to the knuckle.  Mbatha frowns and looks quizzically at the red stain on his rubber-covered hand before sending him further down the corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8.35pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Herbst arrives, a white Afrikaner is shouting. &quot;I love my wife,&quot; he cries, holding up his hands like a boxer, an inappropriate gesture. &quot;I don't hit my woman.&quot; A nurse laughs at him and shakes her finger mischievously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was sent here from the suburbs,&quot; he shouts. &quot;There are hospitals that side, why did they send me here?&quot; A number of patients shift on their stretchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors move towards a communal table in an alcove, flurry, talk and then break off to continue their work. Here is Michael Barrow, the 27-year-old whose aged eyes offer reassurance. There goes Nasser Lahlahi, a handsome Belgium of Moroccan descent, serious, flu-ridden and intense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Here comes Stefan Vukasonivoch, a Serb who refers to himself as a Yugoslav and speaks with the tongue of a philosopher. Tamara Burchard, a 20-year-old intern who feels the need to work at Baragwanath because of her white guilt, sits down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9.25pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now it starts,&quot; says Dr Jabu Moyo, the chief resident, as chaos comes flooding down the corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10.30pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The barracks fill with the smell of blood. Rose Mesani is with her sister's father-in-law, Amos Mzwantile, who lies beaten senseless on a stretcher. &quot;His landlady organised for thugs to beat him up because our children were fighting,&quot; she says. &quot;I came home and found him walking around with no mind.  I'm worried about the children because they are still there and we are here.&quot; The children are under six.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trolleys are piling up, shapes shaking under blankets and dripping gore, many of them shot. Strangely, there is very little sound. The Zulus and the Xhosa don't scream, rarely even complain, frequently laugh with appalling courage in the face of the most hideous pain. &quot;Blood river,&quot; says Vukasonivoch as he wanders past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11.25pm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Glen Makabe, a bandage around his foot, is wearing a pink-and-white polka dot hat. There is a large pool of blood under him. &quot;This life is too fast,&quot; he replies. &quot;I was at a street party and suddenly people start shooting. I was shot in the foot, but it was a mistake.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He takes off the bandage, displaying a small hole in his ankle and another in his heel where the bullet exited. In the 1980s Makabe had spent a year and half in Baragwanath. &quot;They are treating us better now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I notice a trail of blood spots on the floor and follow it; Hansel without his Gretel. The trail ends in a large lump of drying gore that defies metaphor. &quot;They estimate a third of the blood here is HIV-positive,&quot; says Burchard. A passing man says, &quot;God bless you&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrow says around 300 000 people are admitted to Baragwanath every year.  That does not include the people treated and sent home on the same day or the 1 400 babies who emerge weekly into the world here. &quot;It's good fun,&quot; he says - laughter the only exit. A doctor introduces himself as Harley Simon, as in the motorbike. &quot;That's where I was conceived,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12.11am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reginald Silas has two bullet wounds in his leg, tiny marks, just a little hole on each side. He was walking home with his girlfriend when three men approached, told him &quot;we're living in a gangster's paradise&quot; and shot him. &quot; They took my girlfriend. I don't know whether she is alive, dead or if they raped her. I trust my ancestors to do the best they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the stitching room the nursing auxiliary sews a large L-shaped piece of flesh back on to a man's head with lightning speed. Earlier, a security guard had said the worst thing he sees is people with their upper lip cut off: &quot; Their teeth shine on the outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nurse pulls the patient's head back and looks at his chin, split open vertically to the bone. It is the bad facial wounds that move bile up a throat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.55am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By now Makabe's shock is wearing off and he is feeling cold. Herbst has disappeared after a chest X-ray, hopefully home to his sister. The doctors are spending ever more time in the resuscitation room in their attempts to save patients from death in a pool of their own vomit, blood and shit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bernard Kujamo and his brother Fernando have suffered multiple gunshot wounds. Gert Kruger, a policeman who looks as if he has seen everything but lost none of his compassion, is talking to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were five brothers,&quot; Kruger says later. &quot;Apparently some men came into their house with guns, led them down the road, forced them to lie on the ground and started shooting. Two are here, two are dead and the fifth has disappeared.&quot; I ask how this registers on the scale of Soweto crime. &quot;This is pretty bad,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.50am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Soweto, my friend, forget it,&quot; says an old man. &quot;It's getting worse, everyone wants a gun. The innocent people are killed by thugs, and those thugs are protected by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burchard wanders over with a severed ear while, a little way off, the owner pleads with a doctor to sew it back on. &quot;We can't, it's dead,&quot; says the doctor. The patient insists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor takes the ear from Burchard and pulls at the white flesh. &quot;It's more than five hours old,&quot; he declares. &quot;It is a dead ear.&quot; The patient, who had it bitten off in a bar brawl, shouts, &quot;It's not&quot;, while Burchard struggles with laughter. &quot;The plastic surgeon will make you a new one,&quot; she says kindly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.03am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctors begin to relax as the tide of violence recedes. The admission clerks listen to Zairean music, dozing behind their glass screens. The porters are asleep, wrapped in hospital blankets amid the detritus of the outside world. The pools of water are now tinted red, the stretchers are gone; there are bandages, rubber gloves and cigarette butts in their place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrow is treating a drunk and incoherent Zulu. The patient has a length of string wrapped around his arm to protect him from bullets. &quot;Where's it hurting, Bubba?&quot; the doctor asks, and when there is no reply adds: &quot;You never know whether it's drink or something worse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrow's grandfather was a GP, his father and eldest brothers are surgeons and his younger brothers are studying to be doctors. He looks around him. &quot; You know, it's not as if I'll be here for the rest of my life,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.45am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was never one of those little girls who didn't like blood or bugs,&quot; says Burchard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.53am</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier a disembowelled man had arrived with a cop. &quot;I didn't want to know the story, but the policeman insisted on telling me that he had raped a girl and killed her mother,&quot; says a doctor. &quot;How can you avoid it affecting your treatment?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community had disembowelled him before the police got there. The doctors had pushed it all back in and sewn him up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dawn</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The darkness is lifting and Barrow heads for the ward where the most seriously injured spent the night. The beds are packed tightly next to each other and trolleys are end-to-end down the aisle. Bernard Kujamo is in a wheelchair, he complains of lack of sleep, he looks terrible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrow stops by each bed and examines the wounds. He sends a gunshot victim home. The next patient is not so healthy, he has been beaten with iron bars and the doctor packs him off for more tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third's lung is punctured after a beating, a bottle full of blood from his chest stands under the bed. Barrow checks how much has come out during the night. &quot;Good, good,&quot; he says and moves on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Light pours through the ward's windows and through the prism of exhaustion the events of the night drop back through the looking glass. Suddenly, above the fruits of Soweto's grim harvest of crime, voices break out in harmony - the nurses are singing Amazing Grace with a beauty intensified by the suffering around them. The suddenness of it is a shock, unlike anything else in the world. As the day brightens, the voices bring calm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - An apartheid-era plan to move thousands of farmworkers off government-owned farmland in the Northern Province into rural villages has resurfaced in the guise of land reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the 5 000 people involved oppose the plan, saying they have not been properly consulted and promises that they would have first priority over the land have been broken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The land at stake is a 70km-long strip of cattle country and government-run irrigated citrus and tobacco farms near Potgietersrus. Provincial land reform officials for the Gillimburg area have divided the land into 38 units. These are to be given to farmworkers who are at present landless.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people currently living on the 50 000ha site are being encouraged to move into rural villages called &quot;agrivillages&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan is being implemented as a Land Reform Pilot Project by the Land Affairs Ministry and provincial and local agencies. It is the largest such project in the country. But it is the same plan drawn up in 1988 to integrate the area into the then Lebowa homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's totally bizarre that in the name of land reform, they're doing old Bantustan consolidation which the apartheid regime failed to implement,&quot; says Marc Wegerif, a former consultant on the project. Disenchanted, he decided against having his contract extended last year . &quot;They're basically setting up a township with no rights to the land.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Elias Mahapa, the provincial Land Department's manager in charge of Gillimburg land reform, says residents will benefit from roads, school, sanitation, electricity, water and other services, as well as small parcels of land, that will be provided in the agrivillages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If residents do not want to move to the agrivillages, he says, they will not be forced. He cannot say what will happen to those who do not want to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first of the agrivillages, to be called Witrivier, is to be built near a dirt road through the bush-covered veld.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents now live in mud-walled or scrap-metal huts scattered through the bush, eking out a living from farm wages, little plots of mielies and the few chickens that peck in their yards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than being accepted as a mechanism for positive change, the plan is seen by many residents as another way to oppress them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mahapa and other officials tried to speak to residents about the plan last weekend, they were booted out of the meeting. Residents accused one of them, Gilbert Pila -a member of the Transitional Local Council who showed up at the meeting in a double-breasted suit and shiny rings on his fingers -of threatening to bulldoze their homes unless they moved into the agrivillages, a charge he denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But residents and others say some local officials want some of the land to graze cattle owned by themselves or their friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Besides land reform, we are happy here,&quot; said Fanny Motlanti, a young farmworker from the Gillimburg village of Luxemburg. &quot;We want to stay here.  If there's any action to move us forcefully, we won't like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zachius Moabelo, who lives in a hostel in Luxemburg, would prefer to see land reform offer farmworkers shares in the government-run farms already operating on the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that option has not been fully examined by planners, nor have any other possibilities apart from the current plan. Department of Land Affairs documents show a R3-million planning budget to study both the agrivillage option and other proposals. None of this money has been spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of consultation with locals is a major grievance. &quot;They don't want to talk to us. They just want to tell us what to do,&quot; said Edith Phakgadi, from the village of Saint Holland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such problems prompted Land Affairs officials in Pretoria to slap a moratorium on the scheme late last year. But pressure from local officials to get the project moving led to the reversal of that decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's no way we are going to stop everything and wait for a plan,&quot; said Tshisa Madima, director of planning for local government in the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Advertisements have now been published calling for applications for 20 of the 38 parcels of land. People from outside Gillimburg can apply. Last week, another advertisement in a local newspaper called for Gillimburg residents to apply for homes in Witrivier .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People remember when Land Affairs Minister Derek Hanekom told them two years ago that Gillimburg residents would have first priority over this land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many now doubt that promise. Standing on the road leading to one of the Gillimburg farms, Samuel Ngoenya, who is unemployed, firmly gives his view on land reform: &quot;I've been living here a long time, 25 years. I want to stay here. This land is for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sue Lund, deputy director general in charge of land reform in the Land Affairs Department, told the Mail &amp; Guardian: &quot;I am not convinced that planning was done in an appropriate way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she was unable to say what might now be done.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The pilot programme to spearhead land reform has fallen flat, with most provinces spending only a fraction of the budgets set aside for this purpose. Jim Day reports</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government programme set up two years ago to spearhead land redistribution has failed to hand over more than a few acres to the landless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Figures from the Department of Land Affairs show the Land Reform Pilot Programme has spent less than R20-million of its R314-million budget, and that provinces such as the Western Cape, Mpumlanaga and the Northern Province have spent nothing of the millions they were allotted to give as grants to the landless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials blame red tape and inexperience in the provinces for the mess, and warn that much of the cash -originally drawn from the Reconstruction and Development Programme -will have to be handed back to central government coffers unless it is spent by next March.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The national Land Affairs Department has now taken charge of the programme, arguing that it hopes to learn from past failures and bring new impetus to the scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Realistically, I don't think we'll use all the funds,&quot; Land Affairs Department deputy director general, Sue Lund, said. &quot;We'd all hoped it would be quicker, but I'm satisfied in some areas.&quot; She believes most of the money will be used before the time runs out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme, which consists of 195 projects, was set up in early 1995 as a way to &quot;kickstart&quot; efforts to give land to 39 000 households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme is a crucial component of South African land reform, which estimates have suggested could affect up to 3,5-million people who have been dispossessed of land in the past, as well as others with land claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects were targeted on areas where the need for land reform appeared to be most pressing. In most cases, funds were allocated to buy land from private owners for redistribution; in other cases, funds were earmarked to smooth the transfer of government land to private owners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But department figures produced in January show that just 6,2% of the budget has been spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On grants, Gauteng showed the strongest performance, spending nearly 14% of its R21,7-million budget for its three projects. Seven other provinces spent less than 3% of their grant budgets, with the Free State -assigned R47,8- million for grants for 88 projects -spending just 2,84%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape, Mpumalanga, Northern and North West provinces, together allotted R140-million for grants, had spent nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document also shows that 38 of the projects have been scrapped, 27 of them in the Free State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials cite lack of resources, lack of experience in implementing land reform, cumbersome bureaucratic procedures and other reasons for the slow pace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But they say the projects also acted as a testing ground to develop structures for future land redistribution -viewed in that light, the programme is not seen as a total washout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The programme revealed, among other things, the need to include experts in agriculture, housing, and water affairs to ensure land redistribution creates sustainable communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pilot programme has been important in providing a base,&quot; said Malcolm McCarthy, a manager of land reform projects with the Land and Agricultural Policy Centre. &quot;But there are still enormous amounts of problems on the ground in terms of resources.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But officials also admit that most people don't care about streamlining bureaucratic structures or a proper framework -they want to see results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you talk with people on the ground or with politicians, they're not satisfied with the pace of delivery,&quot; said Debbie Newton, the provincial director of the Free State's Land Affairs Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned, however, that transferring land quickly could undermine the long-term success of the projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We could see enormous progress in the next 18 months and enormous failure in three years,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THINUS VAN DER MERWE (31), a policeman for 13 years, was killed in a shoot-out under moulting jacaranda trees in Kensington, Johannesburg, just after lunch on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it had been in the Gauteng school term, he would have died at more or less the same time as suburban buses bump along the hills and valleys of Highland Road, stopping every few streets to drop off pupils of the local primary school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highland Road marks the southern boundary of Kensington, lined on both sides with jacarandas which droop and sway over a dazzling variety of solid, old homes in this middle-class suburb. The street could be a backdrop for any nostalgic glance at a safer time in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The garden walls are not as majestic or impenetrable as those which surround Johannesburg's northern suburbs. Some are still low, pre-cast concrete walls of ox-wagon wheels. There are even ordinary garden gates which click open and shut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for most of Monday afternoon, all that orderly living ruptured.  Helicopters hovered over a few houses in Kensington, in particular above my home and two or three neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It began at lunchtime when two uniformed policemen, Nick Jones (44), a superintendent at Cleveland Police Station, and his colleague, Van der Merwe, were cruising along Highland Road. They were doing what we had asked: they were patrolling our suburb, a visible police presence keeping the streets safe for our children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some reason, happenchance, a sixth sense perhaps, the policemen stopped two young men and asked them their business. That's when the shooting started, and Van der Merwe died almost immediately from a bullet wound in his neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones returned fire and managed to radio for help. Then the police car crashed into a lamp-post. Within minutes reinforcement cars shrieked to the rescue and a suspect, aged about 18, was arrested down the hill in Alice Street, perhaps the prettiest road in Kensington and just metres from my home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jones, severely injured, was rushed to hospital; Van der Merwe's body was wrapped in plastic and taken to the mortuary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By this time the chopper had arrived. It stayed until after dark, hovering, swooping and soaring, the noise deafening, clattering above the camelias and winter seedlings, rotor blades bending trendy palms and extra-blue plumbagos flat in the tremors of their downward gale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chopper's noise, into the cold dark of an early winter's night, was the horrible sound of war -the sound many reporters in Southern Africa have heard before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time helicopters flew so low over the suburb was before the general elections in April 1994, when Kensington was on the daily route from police headquarters to the worst of the township wars east of Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As I drove home in the early evening, I saw and heard the helicopter above my house and its bright, blueish spotlight lighting up the trees. A crowd had gathered and a man in a suit clutching a cellphone asked me to park in the adjoining street around the corner from my house. A polite and pleasant policeman, teeth clenched tight with cold and tension, escorted me into my house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An armed and dangerous man wearing grey pants and a yellow shirt was either in my garden or in that of my neighbours, or in the street, the policeman shouted above the throbbing of the chopper hovering above the chimney.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Policemen leapt over our walls, on to our tin roofs, through our garages, and we cringed inside and closed the curtains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When night settled in, the crowd drifted away and the helicopter's searchlight was switched off. The sounds of war lifted and faded. Yellow- shirt, armed, dangerous and hopefully frightened out of his wits, had survived an onslaught the like of which Kensington had never seen before.  Presumably he would spend the night in his hide-out, in some sheltered patio or behind some tree, maybe metres away from our bedrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the night would be bleaker still for Thinus van der Merwe's children, Marnus (4) and Chantelle (2).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The exposure of alleged ANC spy Sifiso Nkabinde highlights the nature of the tension between George Fivaz and Sydney Mufamadi, write Mail &amp; Guardian Reporters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public spat between Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi and national Police Commissioner George Fivaz is the culmination of old tensions around police inability to deliver in the face of severe public and political pressure to staunch the rampant crime wave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while Safety and Security Secretary Azhar Cachalia, Mufamadi and President Nelson Mandela's office labelled Fivaz's charge of political interference a &quot;red herring&quot;, officers in the Fivaz camp claim there has indeed been tension around perceptions that Mufamadi was trying to hijack police intelligence functions for party-political purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cachalia said last week's restructuring announcement by Fivaz - the ostensible cause of the disagreement - was not the issue. &quot;The root here is a problem around the view we have of (police) management's inability to deliver.  We maintain there is a serious skills shortage ... with or without the present commissioner.&quot; This came against a background of public and political pressures to deal more effectively with crime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said there had been an &quot;accumulation of disagreements&quot; with police management before, including the public spat last year when he himself had labelled the plan to arrest 10 000 most-wanted criminals as a &quot;gimmick&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There had also been a serious disagreement between Mufamadi and Fivaz over Mufamadi's perception that police management had dragged its heels in the development of a police human resources plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An officer close to Fivaz this week said tensions between Fivaz and Mufamadi went back as far as early last year, when there had been &quot;consistent pressure&quot; from the minister on the police to deliver a list of police agents and informers' names to him, to be handed to the National Intelligence Agency.  Fivaz refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer said Mufamadi's attempts to &quot;grab&quot; the police intelligence capacity for party-political purposes was central to the row. &quot;This is what Fivaz means by political interference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said symptomatic of this - and one of the latest incidents that angered Fivaz -was the way KwaZulu-Natal warlord Sifiso Nkabinde had been exposed as an alleged police spy within the African National Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leonard Radu, the assistant police commissioner who died in a car accident a few weeks ago, had been instrumental in the exposure of Nkabinde. A former senior ANC intelligence operative, Radu headed the police Internal Security component -successor to the old security branch -at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officer claimed Mufamadi had instructed Radu to unearth police files on Nkabinde, and that these had been handed to the ANC -a blurring of his police function and his party-political background. The M&amp;G has established independently that Radu had investigated Nkabinde at the time of his death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior police officials this week also speculated that among the long- standing tensions between Fivaz and Mufamadi was the position of Andr' Pruis, divisional head of the police National Standards and Management Services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pruis, who has a security police background, has led a number of piecemeal attempts to restructure police management, and plans like the arrest of the 10 000 most-wanted criminals, which was widely regarded as a failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said a senior police management member: &quot;There is a feeling in the organisation that we try to address crime problems by creating structures, rather than (fighting crime). There is too much restructuring, too many grand plans ... That is basically the frustration I'm picking up among members.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mufamadi hinted on Monday at similar unhappiness from his side: &quot;I believed then (when Fivaz made his restructuring announcement), and I still do, that the premature restructuring of the service perpetuates the culture of 'fire brigade' management which has characterised the management approach to dealing with problems thus far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cachalia denied Pruis's position was related to the immediate cause of the tension. But a plan by Fivaz to appoint Pruis to head one of the two new divisions announced in his restructuring may not have gone down well with Mufamadi, who has the right to veto top appointments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Fivaz announced the restructuring last week, he said Louis Eloff would be appointed divisional commissioner in charge of the newly named and reshaped National Crime Prevention and Response Service, while Manie Schoeman would be divisional commissioner in charge of the new beefed-up National Detective Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Fivaz added: &quot;I must also emphasise that these appointments do not exclude future redeployment of top-echelon management members, including the above-mentioned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior police officers said Fivaz had intended to replace Eloff with Pruis - who had not applied for either of the two positions in the first place -in a matter of weeks. The officer close to Fivaz confirmed the intended reshuffle, but said it was a strategy to &quot;get Pruis out of the engine room&quot; of change management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eloff would get Pruis's current position in the reshuffle. He said there had been tensions around Pruis &quot;both internally and with the minister&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A Cape Town seamstress has accused Gerald Morkel, MEC for police in the Western Cape, of selling her a structurally unsound house which is falling apart.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gwennie Booth said she bought the house in Mariner Road, Heathfield, from Morkel in a private deal in 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morkel is one of the National Party's foremost leaders in the Western Cape. Booth said that she voted for the party in the 1994 general election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morkel's terms were tempting to Booth, who had lived in rented accommodation in Grassy Park up to then and did not have much ready cash. He allowed her to pay her deposit to him over a period of time in instalments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, five years later, the house is suffering from widespread damp and the walls are cracking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In protest Booth halted her bond repayments last August, arguing that First National Bank (FNB) -which had given her a R160 000 loan for the purchase of the house - should sort out the problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FNB, in response, is planning to auction her house on Monday, to recoup the money lost from the unpaid instalments. Morkel is to sue Booth for not paying the instalments for the deposit, which she said she had not paid in protest against the widening cracks in the house and the rising damp in her bedroom.  She said that she could not afford to employ attorneys and would defend herself in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Morkel referred the Mail &amp; Guardian to his lawyer when asked for comment.  His legal representative said he did not want to pre-empt the court case, but indicated that Booth had not been able to provide documentation to prove that the house had latent defects when sold to her.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The African National Congress is to decide at its December conference where the seat of Parliament will be located, say government sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could be one of the hottest debates at the national conference, scheduled to take place in Mafikeng, North-West province, just before Christmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC is said to be divided on whether to keep Parliament in Cape Town or move it to Gauteng so that it is close to government departments in Pretoria and the country's largest economic centres. The Cabinet is undecided and even Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is said to be in two minds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An investigation into the comparative costs of keeping Parliament in Cape Town and moving it to Gauteng has been concluded by the accountants Deloitte &amp; Touche, but the report is yet to be discussed by a Cabinet committee headed by Transport Minister Mac Maharaj. Sources say the study recommends Gauteng as the seat of Parliament. Neither the president's office nor Parliament's Speaker, Frene Ginwale, would comment on the report this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the report is also said to note that most government departments in Pretoria are housed in rented accommodation. This means that the government would not have to sell many buildings in Pretoria or buy new offices in Cape Town, if it chose to move its administration to the coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidential representative Joel Netshitenzhe said this week that the administrative arm of government would never move to Cape Town, but denied that he had seen the Deloitte &amp; Touche report. He said the report would be released for public discussion after the Cabinet discussed it later this year.  He said the Cabinet would contribute to the debate, but the political parties would take the final decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile the cost of running provincial Parliaments is slowly escalating.  The taxpayer has spent about about R234-million on all nine provinces this year. The most expensive Parliaments are Gauteng, costing more than R48- million and KwaZulu-Natal, costing more than R45-million. The Northern Cape's Parliament is the least expensive to run, costing almost R12-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cost of the provincial Parliaments in the 1995/1996 financial year was R226-million and the year before R194-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is difficult to evaluate whether or not the taxpayer is getting value for money from the provincial Parliaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of the Centre for Sociopolitical Analysis at the Human Sciences Research Council, Jabu Sindane, says it is too early to tell, and they should be given time to develop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem has been that parliamentarians are not always sufficiently responsive to the problems of their constituencies, and they need assistance and information to improve their responsiveness,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sindane has released a document on parliamentary accountability, in which he points out that only 28% of respondents in a recent survey said they received regular information on what the governments were doing. He suggests drawing up job descriptions for MPs and MPLs and training them to assist people and how to network.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A controversial UK firm is at the centre of a growing row over Nelspruit's water privatisation, report Eddie Koch and Sharon Hammond</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A BRITISH firm linked to a secret clique which ran the United Kingdom's Conservative Party's controversial aid-for-trade programme in the Third World is at the centre of a growing row between organised labour and the government over plans to privatise municipal water services in Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) this week announced it will begin a week-long series of protests on May 1 to oppose efforts by foreign companies to &quot;buy&quot; South Africa's water supply services from local authorities -a move it believes will lead to job losses and tariff hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The union says plans to privatise water and waste services in Nelspruit are part of a wider scheme by the British company, Biwater, and other multinationals to obtain lucrative contracts to control municipal water in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a bizarre twist to the controversy, Sanco Holdings -the investment company run by the South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) -has teamed up with Biwater to bid for commercial rights to manage Nelspruit's water. The consortium is tipped to win the tender.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The partnership appears to put Sanco Holdings -headed by former Congress of South African Trade Unions militant Moses Mayekiso -in direct conflict with organised labour and in an alliance with conservative British capital on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports in the British Independent newspaper show Biwater was among a select group of civil contractors and defence manufacturers which benefited from a secret network that controlled the supply of British aid and arms to, and trade with, overseas countries initiated at the start of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher's rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The network, an inner circle of senior civil servants, government and industry figures, effectively decided how the Britain Aid and Trade Provision Programme (ATP) -aid money to help finance contracts from overseas governments -should be allocated, and how contracts for arms sales should be won.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biwater was among five companies which accounted for almost 43% of the ATP budget between 1978 and 1992. Its contracts included projects in Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand -some linked to efforts by the British government to sell advanced defence equipment to these countries. Biwater has also been a generous supporter of the Conservative Party -one of 18 companies which gave the party directly or through a middleman organisation more than Pounds 6- million between 1979 and 1993. Mayekiso was unavailable to comment about Sanco Holdings's consortium partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, though Samwu has &quot;declared war against privatisation&quot;, its members in Mpumalanga appear to be taking a more cautious stance, waiting to see if the plans will generate advantages or job losses for the workforce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samwu's Nelspruit secretary, and employee of the town council, Louis Mthisi, said earlier this week that his organisation wanted the council to explain what it meant by &quot;privatisation&quot; before deciding on a course of action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They (the council) say it's not really privatisation but delegated management. Now, do they mean that all assets will go to the private company that wins the tender or that the water and sewage will only be managed by the company?&quot; asked Mthisi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit council spokesman Etienne Garnett-Bennett said a decision about which of the eight bidders should win the tender for the town's water management had been postponed. This is probably to allow more time for the union movement and the civic organisations to explore and discuss issues surrounding water privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council has asked the unions to elect representatives to a committee that will decide which bidder should be awarded the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of Cosatu's local branch, Michael Nkosi, has also added to confusion at rank-and-file level by saying local residents and workers will probably support privatisation. &quot;Where we live there is no water supply. We believe service would be better from a private company,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Members of the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union could also be affected by the possible privatisation of services delivered by Nelspruit's water and sewage department. But representative William Spencer said: &quot;We don't approve of privatisation but understand the council cannot provide the services the public expects until 10 or even 20 years down the line.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samwu's national leadership is adamant that planned protests will go ahead, and that these will be supported by its members in the Nelspruit area. The union says international experience showed workers lose jobs, water prices rise and quality drops when private companies take over concessions to manage municipal supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samwu is demanding a moratorium on all negotiations between local authorities and the private sector over privatisation of municipal services.  The union wants &quot;restructuring of the public sector&quot; to be dealt with only through the National Labour Relations Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry cannot, in terms of the Constitution, intervene in decisions taken by local authorities over how to manage their water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the department is trying to ensure that municipal water is managed efficiently and in the interests of the poor by promulgating regulations that will lay down a basic set of standards and guidelines for local government. &quot; The proposed water services Bill will give national government a mechanism to promote the public interest in cases like this by requiring local government to go through a structured procurement and planning process in the public interest,&quot; said department deputy director general Mike Muller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of the Nelspruit debate will have crucial implications for municipal water management around the country. Several multi-nationals, including Biwater and French-owned Lyonnaise Des Eaux, see Nelspruit as a place to test the waters before moving on similar bids in Cape Town, Johannesburg and other big cities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Rules governing children's homes are woefully inadequate, the Minister of Welfare and Population Development, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was responding to inquiries by the Mail &amp; Guardian about the spate of disclosures and criminal trials to do with abuses in child-care homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cases of molestation, child rape and general abuse of children who are in protected care is a major area of concern,&quot; said Fraser-Moleketi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lack of adequate control and supervision especially of unregistered homes,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Child Care Act stipulates, she said, that all child-care homes must be registered. &quot;There are, however, instances where groups or individuals establish homes without prior consultation with the Department of Welfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An investigation last August by the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Young People at Risk (IMC) found that only 30% of youth care staff in places of safety are qualified in child and youth care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IMC, headed by Fraser-Moleketi, has recommended drawing up an ethical code of conduct for residential care facilities and a strict code of conduct for staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fraser-Moleketi said: &quot;We are in the process of taking our residential care policy further in working towards minimum norms and standards for state institutions as part of the residential care system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the chief social worker at Gauteng's Department of Welfare, Annette van Loggerenberg, regional welfare homes &quot;don't submit inspection reports unless any serious matters arise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Homes are then given three to six months to reply or to rectify the problems,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases of child abuse are immediately reported to the police child protection unit, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although provision is made in the Child Care Act to inspect -and, if necessary, close down -unregistered homes, inspections are only carried out once every three years by provincial welfare departments, said Van Loggerenberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the legal provisions and safeguards, even one of the country's most prominent child-care residences is currently involved in horrifying reports.  The Johannesburg Children's Home in Yeoville has been thrust into the spotlight as a result of criminal charges being brought against a former senior official. James Arthur Frazer was earlier dismissed by the home after allegations that he had raped and molested children in his care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an earlier case, in 1993, the founder of the Cape Town City Mission Home for Children, the Reverend Bruce Duncan, was accused of sodomising Raymond Mitchell, a child-care worker, at the home. Later that year Mitchell was sentenced to four months' imprisonment for indecently assaulting a boy.  Duncan fled the country before any charges were brought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Durban, Livingstone Jacobs, the founder of the child-care home, Street Children's Shelter, appeared in court late last month on charges of indecently assaulting several children in his care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home was unregistered and was run by the Children's Rights Ministry, a group headed by Jacobs. The home has since been closed down by the KwaZulu- Natal Social Welfare Department.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Witnesses testified in court this week that a senior children's home official sexually abused several children in his charge, reports Stuart Hess</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A FORMER house parent at one of the country's most respected children's homes appeared in court this week on charges that he raped and abused five children in his care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">James Arthur Frazer (50) allegedly touched, sucked and raped the girls at the Johannesburg Children's Home. He pleaded not guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incidents are said to have taken place between 1992 and 1996 and involved girls aged between 10 and 12 at the time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A girl, now 15, who stayed at the home from 1993, testified in the Johannesburg Magistrate's Court that Frazer sucked her breasts and her sexual organs and also asked her to suck his genitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He treated me like he cared about me more than anything else,&quot; said the pretty blonde-haired girl.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did not at first tell anyone because she was afraid they would not believe her. &quot;Arthur told me to deny we had sex so that his wife would not divorce him,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said he had threatened to send her and a friend, also an alleged victim, to an industrial school if they continued to &quot;tell lies about him&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazer was a house parent -a managerial post in which he oversaw several care workers -and the personnel manager at the home in Yeoville for four years. He was suspended on May 20 last year, in connection with the allegations. &quot;He was dismissed from the home following a disciplinary hearing in July,&quot; the home's director, Muriel Farren, told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home, which presently houses 64 children, was established more than 100 years ago. Its board of governors includes prominent public personalities including former Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Roy Andersen, stockbroker Humphrey Borkum, and SABC stars Adrian Steed and Sandy Ngema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home consists of eight cottages, each housing eight to 10 children and each with a child-care worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Physically, sexually or emotionally abused children, and those neglected or abandoned by parents, are placed in the home by the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frazer appeared relaxed as the testimony by the alleged victims was transmitted to the courtroom via television from a small room nearby. The room, designed to make child witnesses as comfortable as possible, has stuffed animals and bright paintings of Disney characters on the walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions from the court were relayed to the children by a social worker who sat with them throughout their testimony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A second girl, also aged 15, said she was a close friend of the first witness. &quot;She would tell me everything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did not believe her friend when she first heard the rumours because &quot;I had a lot of respect for Arthur&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she later took the rumours seriously when she saw her friend with a lot of money. Children at the home were given pocket money according to their ages, &quot;but (my friend) always carried notes with her&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that Frazer tried to &quot;touch&quot; her. When she refused he called her a &quot;spoilt brat&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A child-care worker, Juliana Hoffman, told the court that she saw Frazer with the first girl in his office. &quot;I looked through the curtains which were about 30cm apart,&quot; she said. The girl &quot;was naked and lying with her back on the cabinet while he stood over her performing sexual acts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoffman, who has been at the home since December 1995, worked in the cottage where the girl lived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I first heard rumours about Frazer's relationship with her at a braai in March last year,&quot; said Hoffman. A man who also worked at the home told her &quot; there were things going on in Arthur's office and I would look through his window after hours&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hoffman said she later noticed that the girl always visited Frazer in his office after hours -at about 6pm, which was &quot;strange because he never asked other children to come to his office&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the girl always returned from the office with a gift but she also looked &quot;very uncomfortable&quot;. Hoffman said she did not tell anyone about the incident: &quot;The man is the manager, who will believe us?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;I had a good working relationship with Arthur and had a lot of respect for him. He was good with children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was postponed on Wednesday until September 15.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Fivaz 'too busy' for Gasa case</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WESTERN CAPE police have still to reprimand two officers officially slated over their incompetence in investigating the rape of Nomboniso Gasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The province's commissioner of police, Leon Wessels, said this week that he could not implement recommendations from the Independent Complaints Directorate (ICD) until he heard from police National Commissioner, George Fivaz. In turn, Fivaz's office said he had been too busy to attend to the matter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gasa was raped on Robben Island on January 20, and the police have so far failed to make an arrest. The ICD report, released last week, recommended that two members of the initial investigating team, Constable M McLean and Captain Kevin Jones, be &quot;strongly reprimanded&quot;. The South African Police Union said McClean and Jones should not be reprimanded. Gasa, wife of African National Congress MP Raymond Suttner, said she was tired of being in the media spotlight, but would watch &quot;with interest&quot; how the ICD's recommendations were implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ensuring court martial is fair</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATTEMPTS by the Mail &amp; Guardian and the Freedom of Expression Institute (FXI) to have a Cape court martial opened to the public could go to the high court if the South African National Defence Force succeeds in blocking the application.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application is based on constitutional provisions guaranteeing everyone the right to a fair public hearing in a court or any other appropriate forum.  Staff Sergeant Herman Pheiffer and Corporal Desmond Booysen are being court martialled for alleging that their commanding officer was racist, and with leaking sensitive information to a military intelligence officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court martial resumed in Paarl on Monday, and so far the M&amp;G's attorneys -David Dison, Norval and Wheeldon -have succeeded in gaining public access to the hearing of their application. The court martial ruled, however, that the attorneys only have standing in the case through their representation of Booysen and Pheiffer, and not the M&amp;G and FXI -giving only the attorneys, and not the public, access. The application continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAC's vanished millions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pan Africanist Congress has failed to ask the police to investigate the disappearance of millions of rands from its coffers -four months after a decision at its annual conference that it should do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secretary general Mike Muendene said this week that the PAC wanted to investigate itself further before turning to the police. He said the PAC had yet to identify individuals involved in &quot;fraud and embezzlement&quot; whose names could be given to the police. Most delegates at the PAC's conference in December voted to refer the issue of the missing funds to the police. It was believed that the police would be able to carry out a more thorough investigation than the PAC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report painted a devastating picture of the PAC's financial records and said daily monitoring of all cash-flows was &quot;non-existent&quot;. Muendene said the PAC had independent auditors working on the case. He was unsure of their name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dolny expected to head bank</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HELENA DOLNY, widow of the late housing minister Joe Slovo and special adviser to Land and Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom, is expected to become the next head of the Land Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank, which formerly concentrated on providing cheap loans to white farmers, announced recently it would reposition itself to help &quot;emerging&quot; farmers. It added that it would continue to deal with commercial farmers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - ALL victims of gross human rights abuse who give their stories to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission will be offered the same cash compensation, irrespective of their individual suffering or financial status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's Reparation and Reconciliation Committee said this week that every victim would be given an equal share of the money available, regardless of the number of times they suffered a gross violation of human rights. Means testing had been ruled out as too expensive.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee also noted that most of the victims heard so far had wanted shelter, medical assistance and an investigation of their complaints. Just 100 of the 9000 victims identified so far wanted cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For most victims, money alone is not enough,&quot; said committee member Piet Meiring. &quot;For many people conciliation does not come at a price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We cannot attach a value to the life of a husband, wife, son or daughter.  We cannot put a price on the length or intensity of a torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whatever money is available should belong to all the victims equally. A politician on the gravy train would receive the same amount as an unemployed mother whose only breadwinner has been killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my personal hope that those who do not need the money will return it for redistribution to those who are more needy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reported estimate for the total reparation bill is R3-billion, which would pay for financial and symbolic reparation for the 30000 victims the commission hopes to have on its books by the time its mandate expires in December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the funds will come from government, via the President's Fund.  Foreign governments have already made donations and further funds could be raised abroad, and from the South African public and business community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those victims qualifying for urgent reparation are expected to receive help days after the commission hands its final report to President Nelson Mandela next March.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reparation committee is also formulating a policy of symbolic reparation, holding national and regional workshops as a first step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is enthusiasm for the erection of monuments or memorials, museums, archives and peace parks. A structure similar to the Vietnam memorial in Washington has been mooted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many also support the call for a national day of remembrance and reconciliation, either using an existing public holiday or creating a new one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Documents found in the wrecked car of Internal Security head Leonard Radu led to the identification of two KwaZulu-Natal warlords as alleged agents, reports Ann Eveleth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spy scandal which erupted this week also implicates Inkatha Freedom Party warlord David Ntombela. The Mail &amp; Guardian has established that the evidence which led the African National Congress to expel warlord and MPP Sifiso Nkabinde for being an alleged spy also identifies Ntombela, his IFP counterpart, as an alleged security police agent who reported to the same police &quot;handlers&quot; in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ntombela on Thursday denied the allegations, saying he had &quot;never worked for any police unit&quot; and that he was being implicated because the ANC feared him as much as it feared Nkabinde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde has already denied the ANC's allegations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the M&amp;G has been told that Ntombela and Nkabinde were linked to the security police -and its successor, the Crime Intelligence Service (CIS) -in documents recovered from the wreckage of the fatal car crash in which Internal Security head Leonard Radu died last month. Radu was to fly to Durban to discuss the matter with colleagues when his car left the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations against Ntombela come from three separate and reliable organisations, although none were prepared to comment publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, violence monitors in the province said there was evidence that Ntombela enjoyed close links with the police. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has already heard testimony from two police constables about Ntombela's links with the Pietermaritzburg riot unit. Ntombela this week denied such links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations raise fresh questions about the role the &quot;third force&quot; played in fomenting political violence in the area. The two warlords also ingratiated themselves with the province's peace drive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of Natal violence monitor, Mary de Haas, said there were allegations that Nkabinde and Ntombela had colluded to extend their control over the region while boosting their credibility among supporters. &quot;Now they have both become big peacelords but are continuing to consolidate their territory,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In announcing Nkabinde's expulsion, the ANC named seven security policemen alleged to have been his handlers, including the head of the Pietermaritzburg CIS, Superintendent Chris Moolman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moolman declined to identify his informers, but confirmed that all but one of the men named as handlers by the ANC had worked for him. Two of them - Sergeant Shane Morris and Captain Jerry Brooks -are still with the unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks applied to the truth commission last December for amnesty in connection with the abduction of a person from Swaziland who was to become an askari. The man he abducted was ANC activist Dion Cele whose remains, along with those of two other activists, were dug up last month by truth commission investigators on a farm near Ntombela's Elandskop stronghold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations also revive questions about the unsolved October 1992 murder of a Midlands ANC leader, Reggie Hadebe. He was the &quot;right-hand man&quot; of the late ANC stalwart Harry Gwala. Hadebe's death opened that position to Nkabinde in 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC report on Nkabinde's alleged spying says: &quot;A new era dawned of prolific reports from (Nkabinde), with 1993 recording a regular flow of information (to police).&quot; Nkabinde had apparently joined the United Democratic Front just four years earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Initial spying allegations against Nkabinde emerged after the 1994 death of an ANC Richmond youth leader, Mzwandile Mbongwa. Two of Nkabinde's self- defence unit members were convicted of the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monitors say the allegations against the two warlords have been strengthened by the police's apparent failure to pursue them for crimes they are alleged to have committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of Natal academic and former monitor, John Aitchison, said police appeared to have &quot;allowed certain things to happen&quot; in Richmond -the core of Nkabinde's support base -in order to boost his credibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These included a 1991 ambush of IFP attackers by ANC youths, who had apparently been tipped-off and were able to arm themselves after they stumbled on an Umkhonto weSizwe arms cache. The ambush led to the death of 23 IFP supporters, &quot;yet there was silence from the police and the IFP&quot;, Aitchison said. &quot;The incident didn't even appear in the police unrest report.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, police are believed to have tipped off Nkabinde about two raids on his Dambuza stronghold, which is apparently flooded with illegal arms. Only six weapons were found in the raids.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkabinde has faced growing allegations about his involvement in violence, and a recent report by the South African National Defence Force linked him and Ntombela and several others to paramilitary activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent furore about alleged informers in the ANC's ranks is understood to have presented the party with the opportunity it has long been seeking to cut Nkabinde loose. Nkabinde will address a rally in Pietermaritzburg on Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A JUDGE agreed this week that 13 Inkatha Freedom Party supporters can appeal against their conviction in the Shobashobane massacre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban High Court Judge Hilary Squires granted defence attorneys Shane Matthews, Pieter van der Burgh and Piet Haasbrook leave to appeal against his conviction of their clients on 18 counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder in the Christmas 1995 massacre of African National Congress supporters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did so on three grounds, including: &quot;Whether the trial court erred on the question of common purpose, whether my approach in rejecting the alibis (of the accused) was incorrect&quot; and whether the court has misdirected the charges in relation to four murder victims whose bodies were found at the massacre scene, but no evidence had been led on their murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squires convicted all 13 accused on all counts last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He found that their presence in the 2 000-strong attacking mob amounted to a &quot;common purpose&quot; with the aims of the attack, which he said included murder, assault and the burning of homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence had argued that the state needed to prove each accused had actively participated in the murders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squires this week denied leave to appeal on all other grounds cited by the defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he granted convicted IFP Izingolweni leader Sipho Ngcobo and IFP youth brigade leader Zithulele Zuma leave to appeal against their life imprisonment sentences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a previously postponed decision, Squires also sentenced a 15-year-old youth -convicted on the evidence of his own father, an ANC supporter, of participating in the mob attack -to four years at a prison youth facility where he will be able to continue his formal education, but suspended half the sentence for five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The youth has already spent 14 months in detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Draft legislation proposed by the law commission recommends legalising euthanasia, reports Gustav Thiel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first steps have been taken toward legislation allowing South African doctors to end the lives of the terminally ill. A discussion document by the South African Law Commission, released to the Mail &amp; Guardian, recommends new legislation allowing so-called passive euthanasia -withholding life support or life-saving treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission, which is to release its recommendations next week, stresses that its 180-page report should only be regarded as a discussion document.  The report is open to public submissions until June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But medical experts say the report, which also includes a proposed draft Bill, is likely to lead to passive euthanasia being legalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the draft Bill's clauses is a provision allowing a mentally incompetent person to hand a third party their right to decide whether they should have euthanasia performed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission secretary Willie Henigan said the topic of active euthanasia - where doctors act deliberately to end the life of a terminally ill patient - remained a delicate subject in South Africa, and so no concrete suggestions on it had been included in its proposed legislation. Active euthanasia is expected, however, to be part of the discussion process prior to new legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent research by the medical profession found that one doctor in eight was already practising some form of euthanasia -a breach of current law and their own Hippocratic Oath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report imposes strong caveats on passive euthanasia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 5 of the suggested draft Bill, states: &quot;Should a medical practitioner be requested by a patient to make an end to the patient's suffering, or to enable the patient to personally make an end to the patient's suffering by way of administering or providing some or other legal agent, the medical practitioner shall not give effect to this request unless he or she is convinced that the patient is suffering from a terminal illness; the patient is subject to extreme suffering; the patient is over the age of 18 years and mentally competent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other caveats include ensuring the patient has been adequately informed about their terminal illness, the prognosis of their condition and of any treatment or care available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The patient's request has to be based on an &quot;informed and well-considered decision&quot;, the commission adds. The patient must be given &quot;the opportunity to re-evaluate his or her request&quot;, and he or she must persist in that request.  Also, euthanasia must be &quot;the only way for the patient to be released from his or her suffering&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor must also consult with another doctor who knows the patient's medical history before making the decision.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Liberation Campaign, 1941 - Mussolini's Entry into the European War</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the outbreak of the European war, on 3 September 1939, Mussolini refrained from involving himself in the war. He nevertheless declared that fascist Italy, a close ally of nazi Germany, was in a state of &quot;pre- belligerency&quot;. By that he implied that he was committed to eventually participating in the struggle. By postponing his entry into the conflict he obviated having to fight with Italy's neighbour, France, and avoided any immediate Allied attack on the insecure Italian East African empire, where the Ethiopian patriots were still unbeaten. After Hitler's victory over France in the early summer of 1940, however, the Duce anticipated that Germany would rapidly win the war. Anxious to be participate in an ensuing peace conference he declared war on Britain and France, on 10 June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Historical Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy's entry into the European war, for which the Ethiopian patriots had long been waiting, had important, and almost immediate consequences, making it a turning point in Ethiopian history. Britain, as a result, of Mussolini's action, found itself obliged to modify, if not entirely to abandon, its long- established, pro-colonial, attitude to Italo-Ethiopian relations. The British Government, it will be recalled, had for half a century favoured Italian expansion in Ethiopia. Britain had supported Italy's occupation of Massawa in 1885, and had thereafter consistently sought to accommodate Italian colonial ambitions: by dispatching the Portal mission to help the Italians after Ras Alula's victory at Dogali in 1887, by recognising Italy's Protectorate claim in 1890, by signing the Tripartite Treaty of 1906, by offering Italy a revision of colonial frontiers in 1915, and by participating in the AngloItalian demarche of 1925 against which Tafari Makonnen had protested to the League. Britain's policy of accommodation had continued into the immediate pre-war period, with the restriction of arms sales immediately prior to the fascist invasion, the limitation of sanctions against Italy and the Hoare-Laval plan of 1935, and, finally, the recognition of the Italian &quot; conquest&quot; in 1938.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening of the Liberation Campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opening of hostilities in the summer of 1940 necessarily changed the British perspective. The Italians in East Africa threatened Britain's important sea route to India, and were in a position to overrun three British or British-run territories: Kenya, British Somaliland, and Sudan. The Italians in Libya to the north and in East Africa to the south seemed furthermore poised to occupy Egypt and Sudan, in a pincer operation. This, if successful, would have severed what a contemporary official British publication aptly described as &quot;the wasp-waist of the British Empire&quot;. The Italians in East Africa, almost entirely cut off from metropolitan Italy, and gravely weakened by the activities of the patriots, were, however, in no position to exploit the situation in their favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Help for the Patriots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first, and easiest, British response to Italy's entry into the European war was to offer assistance to the Ethiopian patriots on the borders of Sudan.  The British District Officer at Gedaref, on the Sudanese side of the frontier, immediately dispatched twelve already prepared Amharic letters, written in the name of the British commander in Sudan, General Sir William Platt, to patriot chiefs of Gojjam, Armachaho, Walqayt, and Bagemder. These promised the patriots assistance in &quot;destroying the common enemy&quot;. On 23 June 1940, Emperor Haile Sellassie was flown from England, and shortly afterwards proclaimed, on 2 July that Great Britain would grant Ethiopia &quot;the aid of her incomparable might&quot;. The promised assistance was, however, far less than the patriots expected. Haile Sellassie, in his Autobiography, complained bitterly at its inadequacy, as well as its tardy arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Emperor's Arrival in Sudan: Wooing the Patriots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite such criticism British help proved of decisive importance. News of it, and of the Emperor's arrival in Sudan, had an electrifying effect.  Hundreds of Ethiopians trekked across the frontier into Sudan, while many Italian colonial troops deserted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sandford and Wingate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The British in the months which followed continued to woo the patriots. On 12 August, a British officer, Colonel Daniel Sandford, entered Gojjam, as head of a small Ethio-British mission, Mission 101, to make contact with the patriots, and to encourage them to join together in a common struggle.  Several leaders, then torn by rivalry, shortly afterwards agreed to sign a unity pact. On 20 November a more senior British officer, Major-General Orde Wingate, arrived in Gojjam by 'plane, with promises of speedy, though limited, aid. The patriots, thrilled by his coming, spoke of it as a &quot;sign from the skies&quot;. A dynamic, if at times controversial, leader skilled in guerrilla warfare, he had earlier said to General Archibald Wavell, his superior in Cairo: &quot;Give me a small fighting force of first-class men, and from the core of Ethiopia I will eat into the Italian apple and turn it so rotten that it will drop into our hands&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three Almost Simultaneous Attacks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo-Ethiopian cooperation bore fruit in the second half of January 1941 when the British launched three major, almost simultaneous, attacks on Italian East Africa. The first began on 19 January, when British and Indian troops under General William Platt crossed the frontier at Kassala into Eritrea. They thus began an attack which took them, with unexpected speed, via Karan, site of a fierce battle, through Eritrea into northern Tegray. The second attack, almost five hundred kilometres to the south, opened on the following day, when a much smaller force of Ethiopians, Sudanese and Britons, led by the Emperor, with Wingate and Sandford, raised the Ethiopian flag at the Ethiopian border village of Um Idla. Making contact with the patriots of Gojjam they began an advance to the Blue Nile on the road to Addis Ababa. The third attack, a thousand five hundred miles further south, started four days later, on 24 January, when British and South African soldiers, under the command of General Alan Cunningham, crossed from Kenya into Italian Somalia.  They thus began an immense trek via Mogadishu and Harar to Addis Ababa, which they occupied, on 6 April. The advance to the Ethiopian capital, which had taken De Bono and Badoglio seven months in 1935-6, was thus accomplished by the Allies, with patriot help, in little more than three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Victories of the Patriots</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian patriots played a major, if at the time perhaps not always sufficiently recognised, role in the Liberation campaign. Throughout their previous four year struggle they had done much to isolate, tie down, and eventually weary, the enemy. On eventually receiving British military assistance, they took the offensive and, when provided with British aerial Tsupport, swept across Gojjam to play a significant role in the capture of Burye. The advance of the Emperor's patriot army was so rapid that the British high command began to fear that Ethiopian forces might reach Addis Ababa before their British - and South African - allies, and thus endanger the safety of the city's Italian, i.e. fellow European, population. Royal Air Force support for the Patriots was for that reason no longer forthcoming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ras Ababa Aragay</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Shawa meanwhile, the patriot leader Ras Ababa Aragay, who had fought virtually throughout the entire occupation, now strengthened his position.  Addis Ababa, though guarded by Italian garrison troops protected by pill- boxes and barbed wire entanglements, was virtually surrounded by his and other patriot units. The Italians, terrified that the patriots would break into the capital, were seriously demoralised. Rather than fall into the hands of their Ethiopian enemies they hastened, on 4 April, to surrender to the South Africans, who entered the capital two days later. Central Italian resistance thus came ended. Mussolini's once triumphant army was reduced to a number of isolated, and beleaguered garrisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Emperor, with the patriots, finally entered Addis Ababa, on 5 May 1941, exactly five years after Badogio's capture of the city in 1936. Patriot forces subsequently played an important role in finally &quot;mopping up&quot; operations throughout Ethiopia, from April to November 1941. They were prominent in the capture of many towns, among them Dase, Jemma, Gore, Dabra Tabor, and Laqamti. The patriots also took part in scaling the heights of Amba Alagi, where the Duke of Aosta surrendered, on 16 May. A South African soldier, recalling this operation, observed: &quot;When we, the mighty white conquerors, fell down exhausted, after climbing a few hundred feet&quot;, the patriots &quot;stared at us in amazement; that we were unable to walk unburdened while they ran with loads never failed to astonish them&quot;. The last battle of the war was fought, one more with considerable patriot help, at Gondar, which succumbed to the Allies, on 27 November 1941. Next Week: Problems of Post-War Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Tibebe Terffa (far right) has thirty-five of his works on sale at the new Asni Arts Veranda in an exhibition, 'Visions of the artist' that will stay open until the end of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exhibition offers a full range of the artist's works that, whether in water colour or acrylic on cloth canvas, lean towards the abstract.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tibebe had six water colour paintings mostly done in the early '90's that deal with a verity of topics from 'Awe Woman Masked' to 'Berlin Apartment Windows'. An exceptionally displayed mixed media piece 'To Adem' is one of the highlights of the exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tibebe's home town of Harar features prominently with two rooms dedicated to his fourteen paintings on this theme. Though the town and its people are the nucleus of the paintings, each piece offers a unique insight into the society; and a closer look will tell yet another story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Tibebe, a 1973 graduate of the Addis Ababa Fine Arts School, evolution is a way of life. &quot;There are many conflicts, &quot; he explains, &quot;and I want to draw what is not known. This means there is motion, progress. I enjoy looking at what I don't know.&quot; Pushing himself further in search of new ways of expression probably led to his painting on the gate of the German Cultural Institute Director's house that had the whole Addis crying 'demon'. But all that this proves is the power of the artist that brings forth emotion in every individual. A less threatening but nonetheless thought provoking piece of his at Asni Arts Veranda is 'Matter of Opinion'. With its bold, fat yellow strokes it conveys message that every rebel cries at the top of his lung, &quot; It's my life; its my choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Arab Bank for Economic Development of Africa, Badea, provided a $12 million loan for Bole International Airport Wednesday 9 to renovate and enlarge Ethiopia's major gateway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loan will begin to attract interest of 3 per cent after five years and is repayable in eighteen years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The funds will be used for the expansion and modernisation of the airport including the construction of a new runway and renovation of the existing one. The passenger terminal and air control tower will also undergo renovation. Completion of work is due in 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, six international institutions, one of them Badea, loaned 110.5 million dollars for expansion of the airport. At the time of that loan, Minister of Communications and Transport Abdulmejid Hussein said 130 million was needed for the project, twenty million to be provided by Ethiopia.  Wednesday's loan leaves a shortfall of 7.5 million dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his letter, Archbishop Methodios writes of his &quot;great pleasure that the Obelisk is to be returned to Ethiopia&quot;, and congratulates the Italian Government on &quot;its most wise and noble decision&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such decisions&quot;, the Archbishop declares, &quot;play an important role in fostering good relations between nations, in redressing the wrongs of the past, and in restoring confidence in the integrity of the international community as a whole&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The return of the Obelisk, he concludes, &quot;will be noted, not only in Europe and Africa but throughout the world, as a token of the determination of the people of Italy to continue to play a significant role in promoting healing amongst the nations, so necessary for the futire progress of mankind. May I express the hope that positive and speedy action will be taken to put this enlightened decision to practical effect&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ethiopian Diaspora is quite large, the one in the United States, arguably the most favoured destination, is the largest contingent and is estimated by some at 350,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large number of Ethiopians are also to be found in Canada, Europe and Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hearts and minds of the youth of the nation, especially those of the relatively well-off and well-educated, are in America and the other magnetic destinations mentioned. Ask any nice-looking, neatly dressed, relatively well- fed and well-educated Ethiopian youth what his or her plans for the future are, the inevitable answers would be: going to America, getting a green card there, finding a job to earn money in US dollars and partly paying the way through college.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, the talk of such Ethiopian youths is almost boringly always about DV's passports, visas, green cards, friends and relatives in the United States, letters, postcards, pictures and parcels received from their friends and relatives abroad, US and European cities, high-schools and colleges, and money remittance received in US dollars, etc. Some appear to be far better acquainted with places in the US and Canada than in their own country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scramble of the youth to fill in the so-called DV's issued annually by the United States Embassy here for a chance to emigrate to the &quot;land of promise and opportunity&quot; reflects more than just a desire to seek one's fortune abroad. It seems to be also a symptom of some nondescript malaise that is driving these youngsters out of their country. The looks on their faces fomented by their greedy avidity to fill in the DV's show no sign of an intention to return home if they are lucky enough to be among the 300-5000 annual winners of the US immigration lottery for Ethiopia!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But why do these youths want to leave the country in large droves? One reason is that most of their relatives and friends who have made it to the US and other favoured destinations in the past have done quite well both economically and educationally. They know this from the inward US-dollar remittances which work wonders here when converted into birr at official current exchange rates of upwards of 6.60 per US dollar as against only 2.07 previously; and from the good English in the correspondence they receive from aboard. This then is the pull factor. The push factor is that the opportunity for good education and well-paying job here in Ethiopia is only about one in a thousand, forcing the youth to vote with their feet!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian youth seem to be fed up with the squalor all around them.  They once scarified their own lives to improve the lot of the masses. It now looks as if it was all to no avail. It seems that it is now time to save their own skins. Besides, they don't like the divisive politics currently in vogue in the country. In fact, most members especially females, of the younger generation don't even want to discuss politics at all. A typical female Ethiopian youth yawns widely at the mention of any political subject.  She would much rather talk about the nice photo of her sister in America, which shows her as putting on quite a lot of weight. &quot;What is it that they are eating in America&quot;, she would rather ponder!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Squalid economic conditions, high unemployment, extremely low wages and salaries, ethnicity polarizing domestic politics, are driving the Ethiopian youth and the educated out of the country. All this is very bad for Ethiopia.  We are losing the best and brightest of our people. It wouldn't have mattered if these people were leaving the country for only a few years, with the intention of coming back home after getting all the good education and greenbacks they aspired for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that hardly any of them return on a permanent basis. They may come to visit relatives and friends and places in Ethiopia they like, but most return abroad with perhaps greater resolve to stay there longer, maybe never to return home except for occasional visits. The country's loss of human resources in this way is far greater than the size of the Ethiopian Diaspora would indicate. It is usually the most able-bodied, energetic, intelligent and relatively best-educated and experienced Ethiopians that emigrate, seriously eroding the equality of Ethiopia's population stock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, you've guessed it right! It is a massive brain drain. It is more than that. It is a physique-drain, a beauty-drain and a leg-drain (as in the case of soccer players!). But who is going to solve all the myriad political, economic and social problems here in Ethiopia? who is going to make us feel that we are all the same, old, proud Ethiopian compatriots trying to have our rightful place in the world, not an unwieldy conglomeration of individuals pigeonholed into separate ethnic identities? Who is going to create 500,000 new jobs every year? Who is going to do something effective about the country's social problems such as widespread begging, child prostitution, street dwelling, juvenile delinquency and crime; and about the plight of the disabled and the elderly and about gender problems?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prospects for success in all these problems areas have become all the dimmer with the kind of brain and talent drain that Ethiopia has been experiencing for well over twenty years now. The question therefore would be: is there anything effective we can do to reverse the exodus? The answer could be an optimistic yes if we are willing to take the following measures:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* improve the political climate by changing the political leitmotif from ethnic politics to Ethiopian politics, which embraces the former as well as several other things;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* unleash the economy's potential by liberating land, nationalized physical capital and credit from the fetters of state monopoly and control, and bureaucratic inefficiency;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* be willing to share political and economic decision-making power with prospectively returning Ethiopian professionals on a merit-system basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Otherwise, the cream of the Ethiopian society will continue to vote with its feet, leaving behind a virtually brainless community of zombies, good enough to perform only elementary biological functions such as eating, sleeping and procreating even as resources become ever more scarce! And what is worse, in the absence of the best and brightest, the pets of society take control!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The eleventh annual Africa Prize for Leadership for the Sustainable End of Hunger will be presented at a ceremony in New York on 4 October 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prize honours African women and men who have exhibited exceptional leadership in bringing about the sustainable end of the persistence of hunger at national, regional or continent-wide level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prize focuses on individuals working in areas such as public policy, science, agriculture, education and health -- whose leadership and policies reflect courage, initiative, creativity and, in some cases, personal sacrifice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Past winners include the presidents of Senegal, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ghana and Namibia. In 1994 Nelson Mandela was the recipient, and in 1991, Maryam Ibrahim Babangida received the prize for her role in programmes for women in Nigeria, along with Prof. Wangari Muta Maathai who founded the Green Belt Movement which has employed 50,000 women in planting more than 10,000 trees in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ultimately, the prize is intended to engender a greater appreciation for and support of the effective and dynamic leadership associated with the end of hunger in Africa on a sustainable basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to receiving the Africa Prize sculpture, the winners share a US$100,000 award intended to advance their work for the end of hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Tribune has been approached to submit nominations for the Africa Prize. We invite suggestions from our readers to be sent to us. Nominations must reach New York by 15 May 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Around 990 women and girls have been raped in the country in just the last six months--as opposed 1067 in whole of last year-- bringing the level to a previously unknown high, police reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the total, 68 cases were in the capital Addis Ababa, ENA said. Only 655 of the victims--over half of them children-- reported the crime to the police but most kept silent apparently because of the social taboos. Most of the victims are said to be aged between 16 and 18, with those between 19 and 30 as well as those under 15 also likely targets. The criminals in most cases are aged between 19-30 and operate either individually or in groups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Working to Put the 'Customer' in his Right Place of Honour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walk into a clinic or hospital in this country and you are made to feel by the staff that you are definitely not supposed to be there. So stifling your groans you look apologetically at them, pay up and wait meekly until you are called in to see the doctor. These are not the only places where you pay to be treated as dirt. From the smallest spare parts store to the largest government or private institution (where the harassment as a rule starts with the guard at the gate) the concept of 'customer service' it is unknown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So it is understandable if when you meet the general manager of Ethiopia Clinic you find it a bit hard to believe that treating customers with courtesy is high on their agenda . Bubbling with good humour, Yacob Bekele is one of those people you feel comfortable with nearly as soon as the introductions are over. Sitting behind his desk in a tidy office--despite the piles of books on topics as behaviour science and business &amp; strategic management--Yacob explains that is rare to find a health institution where one is treated cordially. That is why Ethiopia Clinic's 20 staff members make sure they are the exception to the rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in the early 40's, Yacob Bekele, now studying through correspondence for his Doctor of business administration (he cannot wait to also become a 'doctor' he jokes), has held numerous managerial posts before setting up the clinic with two other friends. He spent ten years at the Ethiopian Airlines, mostly in the Addis Ababa Sales region . Among his numerous contributions to the organization, Yacob counts the introduction of a sales tool 'golden lion club' and the wearing of traditional dresses by the female hostesses alongside the usual uniform. He then moved to a travel agency for some four years then became the front office manager in the Ras Hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When demonstrations began in the country a couple of years before the 1974 revolution asking for the &quot;removal of the bosses&quot; Yacob decided to join Sudan Airways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after though disputes broke out between Ethiopia and Sudan and the latter's ticket office closed down. He found work at the Ethiopian textile enterprise but after just four months decided that this was no fun and went to work for the newly established Kenya Airways. &quot;After we had done much to establish it,&quot; Yacob recalls, &quot;I had children by this time and so felt a sense of responsibility I said to myself 'What if one day Arap Moi and Mengistu quarrel will it not mean the closure of Kenya Airways office here ?.  ' So he opted for a dependable paycheck and joined the Ministry of Industry.  Four years later he moved to the Desta Soft drinks factory as general manager then to the newly set up brewery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yacob seemed destined to head one organization after another as he again moved to Gas and Plastic Factory where he worked for six years and was one of those behind the move to expand the production line to include plastic chairs in addition to bottle cases . From 1990-91 he was general manager of Coca Cola factory during which time they managed, among other things, to make operational again the CO2 plant he noted. Following the change in government in 1991, Yacob was retired like many people who had served for twenty years and were over forty-five.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is only to be expected that someone who has held posts of responsibility in different organizations -- and recalls offhand a couple of achievements at each place--has the stamina to pick up the pieces and get on with life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yacob Bekele, married and father of eight, is know one of the founders of Galaxy Tour Agency as well as Ethiopia Clinic (located within his residential compound) .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clinic which is open round the clock and offers the full list of services including pediatrics, minor surgery, E.N.T., gynecology etc...  treats an average of 25 patients a day. With a sense of community, Ethiopia Clinic also gives free medical care to around thirty-two low income individuals from the kebele, Yacob and Dr. Mulugeta Haile Mariam, one of the staff explains. This is not confined to this group as the highly publicized announcement recently regarding a year's offer of free medical treatment for the Ethiopian Olympic committee shows. However, Supplying free medical care to the Olympic team (although a great way of satisfying the nationalistic feeling, not to mention the publicity), Yacob also participates actively in improving the sport nearest to his heart--football. His recent proposal to improve the game--with the introduction of such things as awarding teams for best behaviour as well as best goal scorer etc..-- has sparked interest both within the sport commission and the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yacob is happy to give a tour of the place proudly with the various treatment rooms and waiting rooms. The rooms are enough to give one a sense of peace as they are in more cases than not equipped with state of the art equipment and all equipped with a sink ( &quot;we believe in water&quot; is simply how he explains indicating that along with the courtesy accorded to every patient, Ethiopia Clinic has many passions it follows diligently). We walk into the laboratory and Yacob points to what he noted was one of the first batch of the latest photo-meter (to test blood chemistry) in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The staff are eager to show off their equipment and insist on a demonstration so I choose to have my glucose level tested--which thankfully turned out normal .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - French-based independent organisation working to defend press freedom world-wide, Reporter Sans Frontieres, issued 7 April a letter to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, protesting against the arrest of journalists and, &quot;the continued detention of others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporter Sans Frontieres wrote that on 24 February Atnafu Alemayehu, editor- in-chief of the privately owned Amharic weekly Tomar, along with Kidist Belachew and Tesihalene Mengiesha, former editor-in-chief and shareholder of the privately owned Amharic weekly A'emrio and Mebruk respectively were arrested. This was, according to the letter, &quot;in connection with news they had published in late 1995 disclosing the relations between a Muslim relief organisation named Blessed Relief and Sudanese religious leaders Hassien Al Turabi and Mohammed Sirage.&quot; Kidist Belachew was released on the same day and Tesihalene Mengisha on 14 March after paying bail of 5,000 birr as set by the Federal High Court, but the third journalist was unable to post bail and remains at the Addis Ababa Central Jail, Reporters Sans Frontieres revealed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without wishing to comment on the facts of these cases,&quot; the letter to the prime minister continued, &quot;Reporters Sans Frontieres reminds you that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights considers that detention, as punishment for the peaceful expression of opinion, is one of the most reprehensible ways to enjoin silence and, as a consequence, a grave violation of human rights&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, Ethiopia has ratified the International (convention) on Civil and Political Rights, article 19 of which guarantees the freedom to inform and be informed, Reporters Sans Frontieres asks you to fulfill your obligations towards the international community...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reporters Sans Frontieres specifically asked for the release of Atnafu Alemayehu and the &quot;immediate and unconditional release&quot; of six journalists and one publisher from the private Amharic papers. These are Salomon Gebre- Amlak former editor-in-chief of Mogad,(two years) Alemu Lemma of Mebrek (two years), Dereje Biru editor of Tequami (one year), Sintayehu Abate editor-in- chief of Remet (already completed his one year prison sentence), Lulu Kebede editor-in-chief of Neka (six months), Kassahun Tadesse editor-in-chief of Genanaw (one-and- half- years) and Wesson Seged Mersha publisher of Kitab (six months).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letter closed with a plea for Prime Minister Meles, &quot;to use your influence to secure the lifting of the detention order against Assefa Beyene, editor-in-chief of Ethiop and Samson Seyum, editor-in-chief of Tequami and grant them a fair trial.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Meles has spoken against the Private press on several occasions questioning their integrity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Dismissals in the various member parties of the ruling Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) have continued with the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO) kicking out 250 and placing 80 of its members under custody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government owned English daily Ethiopian Herald reported that action was taken against the above at a recent appraisal meeting where their performance was apparently evaluated against such yard sticks as use of political power, respect of human rights and nurturing democratic Tnationalism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On 24 October last year, Tamrat Layne became the highest official to be ousted from power when a similar appraisal meeting ended with his removal from the Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM)--a coalition of the EPRDF- - and subsequently from the post of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;. Just four months after Tamrat Layne was sacked; the OPDO issued a clear signal that its members were going to feel the heat next.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The fifty year old Ethiopian Airforce last week celebrated the first annual day celebration since the fall of the previous government of Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the three-day celebration that lasted until Friday 4 April, Deputy PM and Defence Minister Tefera Walwa opened an exhibition showing the airforce's history, and awarded diplomas to graduating pilots and technicians.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also held a panel discussion that focused on the role of the airforce in the present society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his comments during the panel discussion, he remarked, &quot;The army's contribution has been particularly conspicous in protecting the development process from anti-development elements&quot; government-owned English daily Ethiopian Herald reported, but failed to clarify what these &quot;anti-development elements&quot; are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The celebration's 50th anniversary angle, though played down by government media on the most part, was however highlighted by the Amharic-language programme of Voice of Germany whose correspondent was quick to point out the leading role played by the airforce in the past--especially during the Ethio- Somalia war of the late 1970's.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission (DPPC) said Friday 4 that the response to appeals it made in February was not satisfactory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They added that relief food is being transported to the area from its own reserve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is supplying 33,842 metric tonnes of food out of the 99,575 mt. required. Save the Children UK has pledged 10,000 metric tonnes, other donors however have fallen short of the appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of water tanks have been secured from NGOs and the German government, this is still 30 per cent below the required figure, said DPPC.  They added that 4.2 million US dollars is needed to sink thirty deep wells and 45 shallow, as well as to prepare 60 traditional water sources and strengthen the supply throughout the affected areas.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we go to press, nursing students at the Zewditu Hospital are on their second day of class boycott protesting that the 120 birr ration was inadequate, Radio Fana reported.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mind you, very recent documents published in 1996 containing some vital information is also being shredded. I am shocked to see the state of affairs, when the UN is going through some economic reform. Some of these documents and publications could have been given to several institutions and universities in Africa rather than being thrown away or shredded. I brought some diplomats from the US and other embassies to witness this operation and they were really stunned!!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The All Amhara People's Organisation (AAPO) called a mass rally at Meskel Square Sunday 6 April to address the issue of the peasant farmers, students, business community and political prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Approximately 20,000 turned up Sunday morning-- despite the kebele (suburb) meetings scheduled that day as well as a football match on television--to listen to speeches of a peasant farmer, a student and a businessman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstrators protested against the land reform in the Amhara region that has left farmers with previous links with the past two governments, a plot of land about one hectare--regardless of family size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A call was made for the immediate release of all university students still being held after taking part in a demonstration 21 March against land redistribution in Amhara region.

Addis Tribune tried to contact the police but has been unable to find out when they will appear in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business community also used the occasion to voice their bitterness over rent increases imposed some eight months ago on kebele-owned business premises that the representative explained in detail as &quot;illegal&quot;.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - H.E. Dr. Kebede Tadesse, Minister in the Prime Minister's office in charge of social and Administrative Affairs, disclosed in his address to the Consultative Group Meeting, held here in Addis in December of last year, the following major features of Ethiopia's health sector:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ethiopia has one of the worst health statuses in the world. This is mainly due to the backward socio-economic development resulting in a low standard of living, poor environmental conditions and inadequate health services. The prevailing social conditions have been aggravated in recent years by the high fertility rate and repeated man-made and natural disasters. Infectious diseases and nutritional disorders are widespread. Among the predominantly preventable diseases, upper respiratory infections, diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS, are major problems. The top killing diseases at the moment are malaria and tuberculosis.  Health institutions are few and unevenly distributed and their facilities and manpower inadequate, resulting in efficient and ineffective services.  There are often shortages of drugs and medical supplies in most of the health institutions. Though the main direction of health was purported to be primary health care organized in a six-tiered system, in practice priority is given to curative rather than to preventive and promotive care. The referral system hardly works and is one of the reasons for the inefficient service and patient dissatisfaction at referral hospitals.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health care situation in Addis Ababa fully confirms Dr. Kebede's honest statements about health conditions in Ethiopia in general. This confirmation becomes all the more striking when one remembers that Addis Ababa, being the capital of the nation, has, in relative terms, the most health facilities. Go to any public hospital in Addis and what you observe is more than just disconcerting: the crowds of sick people trying to get cards or to see doctors are legion; the buildings are crumbling; malodors buffet your nostrils from all directions; it is not uncommon to see seriously ill people lying helplessly in corridors; blood splashed on the floors of corridors may be seen; hospital beds are rickety and in most cases unclean; bed sheets may be stained with blood and pus that remain because of inadequate washing; the food is unspeakably insipid and uninviting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One can talk about hospital bed sheets and food only if one is lucky enough to get a hospital bed in the first place. Many seriously ill people are forced to go back home to their deaths because of the shortage of hospital beds. Doctors, nurses, dressers and lab technicians all seem to be negligent and uncaring because of heavy work loads and insufficient remuneration. Human agony and death have become routine occurrences that have stopped eliciting any visible measure of human sympathy any more. Women in labour are sometimes jeered at with: &quot; You ought to have thought twice before putting your legs up!&quot; Human callousness reaches its height with blistering remarks such as this upon somebody's death: &quot; the world is better off by one parasite less.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That obviously is a very unkind remark, but clearly shows the extent of the human predicament of being taken ill in Addis and elsewhere in the country and of having to go to a public hospital there. Cases have been reported of power cuts in the middle of surgical operations which had to be delayed until the electricity was on again because of the absence of automatically activated stand-by generators. The medical equipment in nearly all the public hospitals is hopelessly outdated and for the most part out of order. Many a patient is told to seek medical treatment abroad precisely because the equipment required to perform an examination is non-existent in the country.  Negligence on the part of medical staff runs the whole gamut from prescribing the wrong medicine, and thus sometimes causing death, to the extreme case of forgetting a scalpel in a person's abdomen on which an operation has just been performed! And what is more, there seems to be no legal liability for such gross negligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Health problems in the country are further compounded by the ever rising prices of pharmaceutical products. Price deregulation and exchange rate depreciation have been two of the major factors behind the price rises here.  It is not uncommon for the price of a medicine which cost only about 2 birr some seven to eight years ago to cost more than 30 birr now! Countless patients in Addis and elsewhere in Ethiopia cannot afford the prices of pharmaceuticals! Access to health services for the poor has gone from bad to worse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above account may seem a little exaggerated, but when one sees the ever increasing frequency of the health problems cited, every word said is absolutely true. There is no doubt that a lot of people do manage to see doctors and have the proper medicines prescribed for them and do actually get better. However, the point is that the number of patients who are not so lucky is increasing rapidly, thus making the health problems cited above much more frequent and visible than was the case in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, mention should be made of the sizeable number of private clinics and the few private hospitals that have been put up. These have definitely contributed to relieving the pressure on public hospitals, but for one thing many private clinics have been shut down on charges of sub-standard facilities and, for another, the private hospitals set up, apart from being few and far between, are far too expensive for the average patient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, private clinics can only handle minor health cases as they do not have the necessary medical facilities, which is in fact why they are called clinics. In addition, fees at private clinics are also beyond the reach of most patients in the country. This latter problem is further complicated by the frequent practice of some private medical personnel of ordering additional prescriptions and medical examinations which, strictly speaking, are not necessary, the intention being to generate more income and sales for themselves and friends in the pharmacy business. This is a case of pecuniary interests taking precedence over the &quot; Hippocratic oath&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia's health profile is one of the darkest on the African continent.  Just take a look at the following statistical highlights most of which were taken from Dr. Kebede's speech, on the country's health status:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Average daily per capita energy intake</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1750 calories (i.e. 80 percent of required amount)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Children showing wasting 5 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Children who are stunted 64 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Pregnant and lactating mothers with anemia 17 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Average national fertility rate 6.1%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Aids cases per 100,000 people 10.7 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Access to drinkable water 18 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Attended births 14 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Health coverage 35 - 45%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. People who receive antenatal care 16%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Population receiving immunization 40%</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Population receiving family planning service 8 %</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. infant mortality rate per 1000 live births 130</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. Maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births 500-700</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. Inhabitants per physician 33,333</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">16. Life expectancy at birth 48</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is to be done? That is a billion-birr question and no honest person can claim to have all the answers. Some basic principles and guidelines could be attempted, however. First, prevention is better than cure. The population at large should be taught that many diseases could be prevented by maintaining good hygiene standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its barest essentials, this involves no more than boiling water before drinking, cleaning one's home, compound and environment, using soap and water to keep one's personal hygiene, and disposing of human and other waste in a timely and regular manner; second, as one of the major causes of the country's health problems is population pressure, popularizing the advantages of family planning should be undertaken with real commitment on the part of the relevant government institutions; third, the central government and regional administrations should continue to increase their health budgets in order to be able to construct institutions at a pace commensurate with the overall demand for health services, targeting widespread diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis for special attention; fourth, the private sector should continue to be encouraged to invest in the health sector as it could relieve the pressure on public health institutions, especially the pressure coming from those who can afford higher medical costs; fifth, as water-borne diseases account for a large number of the illnesses in the country, the provision of potable water for the population at large, especially for the rural population, should be given high priority in the government's capital expenditure; sixth, attempts should be made to make domestic conditions favouable so that Ethiopian doctors abroad may return home both as investors in the private health sector and as medical practitioners in public and private hospitals and clinics. Well, it may now sound like an uphill task to try and come up with workable solutions to the enormous health problems in Ethiopia, but with a thorough understanding of these problems and real commitment, a start towards a genuine breakthrough can be made right today!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MUTARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Over 250 students at Africa University, about 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) north of Mutare, were suspended on Monday, following an eleven-day lecture boycott prompted by a 17-percent hike in student fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students met on Monday morning and resolved to issue a 48-hour ultimatum to the chairman of the institution's board of directors, Bishop Emelio de Cavalho, to address them over the fee increase dispute but were surprised to receive letters of suspension in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, 33 post-graduate students studying for Masters degree in Business Administration (MBA) were not suspended as they resumed classes on Monday morning in preparation for their final year examinations in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 3, Africa University's board of directors approved an increase in student fees from the current ZD 33,000 (USD 3,000) to ZD 38,500 (USD 3,500) with effect from August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students objected to the increase which the administration said was the first ever since the institution opened its doors in 1992, claiming they came from poor families and would not afford such exorbitant hikes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their lecture boycott started soon after the announcement of fee increase and all efforts to resolve the issue failed as students remained adamant that they wanted an audience with de Cavalho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administration was unmoved on its stance that de Cavalho could not be summoned by students, instead they should wait for his response to their petition over the fee increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students then decided to issue an ultimatum to the administration on Monday morning and the administration responded by issuing suspension letters in the afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 14.00 hours, the university vice-chancellor, Dr. John Kurewa, served the students notices which gave them five days to apply for re-admission. This would be effected only when it met the conditions set by the vice-chancellor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the set conditions was that the applicant should give a written undertaking to pay all the university fees as recently determined by the institution and submit to any disciplinary process the authorities might decide to pursue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The students said they were finding it difficult to understand why the administration set such conditions as their main complaint was that they could not afford the high fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing the decision by the administration as cruel and insensitive, some students said they would not seek re-admission as it was practically difficult for them to raise the required fees. The suspended students, majority of them Zimbabweans, were given two hours in which to pack their belonging and leave the campus. Some students were seen walking to Mutare city with their property on their backs while others boarded minibuses hired by the students representative council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some foreign students told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency (ZIANA) they were going to spend the night on the streets as they had nowhere to go, but the president of the students representative council, Sam Mhlanga, said the suspended students were going to the Manicaland provincial governor, Kenneth Manyonda's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to spend the night at the governor's office. We will not go anywhere else as we have foreign students here who have nowhere to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need government's intervention because the problem is now out of hand.  The administration does not want to solve our problems. All it wants to see is us going back to classes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 50 armed support unit police officers were sent to the campus at 14.00 hours (12H00 GMT) to ensure all the suspended students, who have been very peaceful in their lecture boycott and demonstrations, left the campus without destroying property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Africa University Director of Information, Andra Stevens, said the administration suspended the students to restore order at the institution. She said those students who wished to continue with their studies were being disturbed by the lecture boycott by other students and were now given the opportunity to continue their studies in peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Mhlanga said the students were surprised by the administration's decision to suspend them. He said students expected the Kurewa administration to facilitate dialogue between students and de Cavalho.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The recent trade agreement between South Africa and Zimbabwe has had little impact on interest in clothing and textile stocks on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange as financials continue to dominate the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clothing and textile counters continued to play second fiddle to other counters, particularly the new stocks which have been attracting a lot of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts told the Zimbabwe Inter-Africa News Agency that the failure by the agreement to scrap quantitative restrictions on clothing exports has not helped to generate new interest in counters like Zimbabwe Spinners and Weavers, or Spinweave, and David Whitehead. These counters have been reeling under punitive import measures by South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two neighbors reached agreement on the rules of origin for clothing and textiles as well as preferential tariff and quota levels for Zimbabwean clothing and textile exports to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts said the quotas, at 30,000 tons per producer per annum for clothing exports from Zimbabwe, were unlikely to change, suddenly, the prospects of the clothing sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agreement has been widely expected to make Zimbabwe's ailing clothing and textile sector profitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What has been of interest during the past week, however, is that the NMB (National Merchant Bank) issue has diverted most of the attention from other stocks on the market,&quot; an analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The interest generated by the issue, which is expected to start trading April 17, has made all other stock unattractive thereby slowing down the widely expected revival of the stockmarket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The market is just hopeful that once the NMB issue is over and its price, which is currently considered very cheap, starts to increase in the after- market, the issue won't be as attractive so that people will start looking around for other stocks,&quot; the analyst said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, foreign participation continued to wane as investors continued to take profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Funds invested by the foreigners since June 1993, when they were first allowed to participate on the local bourse, dropped by 7 percent to Zimdollars 1.1 billion (100 million U.S. dollars) in the week ending April 4, compared to the previous week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total combined shares rose by over 12.9 million zimdollars (1.17 million dollars) to nearly 4.44 billion zimdollars (403 million dollars) during the same period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Swedish envoys in sub-Sahara Africa began a three- day meeting Monday aimed at promoting a new relationship in the form of development help Sweden gives to poor countries, in line with the changing political and economic climate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It must become more equal -- turn into a partnership,&quot; the diplomats said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Development cooperation is still needed but its character must be changed in order to reduce the negative aspects of aid dependency.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lusaka meeting, dubbed &quot;partnership Africa&quot;, has brought together at least 40 ambassadors and counsellors in the region who intend to establish a new relationship between African countries and Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting is also being attended by the assistant under-secretary of state, Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm, Jan Bjerninger, and the assistant director-general of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, department for Africa, Sten Rylander.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An international conference is scheduled for June in Stockholm where some 100 representatives from the cooperating partners in Africa are expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Partnership Africa focuses on democracy, the global economy, aid and the present relationships between Swedish society and African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sweden has now placed heavier emphasis to countries that actually seek to bring about poverty reducing development. In countries where this commitment is weak, the focus is on programmes that benefit the poor, mainly through unofficial channels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa receives a greater part of Swedish development support than any other region. In 1994 and 1995, 35 percent of Swedish bilateral aid went to Africa. Asia received 22 percent, South and Central America 10 percent and the rest went to central and eastern Europe and global programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa Sweden's help go mainly to Angola, Botswana, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Nigeria's military government has distanced itself from a raging campaign by individuals and organisations urging the country's leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, to succeed himself at the end of his ongoing transitional programme, in October 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the first official reaction to the controversy, Special Duties Minister Wada Nas called the campaign &quot;futile flights of fancy,&quot; capable of jeopardizing the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the last few weeks, there have been many sponsored advertisements in some national newspapers by some obscure individuals and organisations claiming to be canvassing for the participation of the head of state, Gen.  Sani Abacha, in the electoral race for the presidency in 1998,&quot; Nas said Sunday in a two-page statement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These advertisements,&quot; he added, &quot;have consequently generated a belief among unsuspecting Nigerians either that they (the adverts) are being sponsored by the government or are done with its knowledge and approval.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas said &quot;invariably, unsuspecting people assumed that the contrived presidential ambition of the head of state is a reality and even proceed to spread uncharitable impressions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These activities are clearly prejudicial to the integrity of the programme for political transition, as well as the sincerity of its leadership in pursuit of its avowed commitment to handing over to a democratically elected civilian administration in October 1998.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warning that such moves constituted a serious threat to the transition programme, the minister said: &quot;Those behind these sponsored advertisements, including newspapers which publish them for a fee, should be fully aware of the implications as well as the remedial measures available to government in the face of activities inimical to the attainment of its stated objectives especially the implementation of the political transition programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He singled out two of the organisations -- the &quot;Youths Earnestly Ask for Abacha '98,&quot; and the &quot;General Sani Abacha for '98 Presidency, National Mobilisation and Persuasion Committee.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas said experience had shown how the &quot;activities of (such) phantom organisations can jeopardize the smooth implementation of the political transition programme by government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to a similar campaign by another shadow group the &quot; Association for Better Nigeria,&quot; which led an unsuccessful crusade for former military ruler, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, to remain in power beyond his stated hand-over date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Babangida was eventually forced by political pressure, over his annulled June 12, 1993 presidential election, to step down from power in August of that year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas cautioned Nigerians against &quot;engaging in frivolous and mischievous exercise of freedom of expression that is capable of disrupting the process of attaining full democracy,&quot; in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The federal government reassures all Nigerians that the ongoing political transition programme is not a charade but a resolute commitment to hand-over to a democratically elected civilian administration in October 1998,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - MISA-Tanzania reports that authorities on the islands of Zanzibar have threatened to order the arrest of practising journalists not in possession of a licence. The Islands' Chief Information Officer, Idrissa Haji, quoted in the March 11 state-controlled Daily News said his information department has so far issued 43 licences but more than 50 other journalists known to be working there were yet to obtain licences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On December 13, 1996, Zanzibar Information Services (ZIS) announced the licensing of journalists starting January, 1997. Authorities set February 28, 1997, as deadline. ZIS said journalists executing their duties without such a licence would be fined Tshs 500,000 (U$1000.00) or sentenced to five year's imprisonment. ZIS Deputy Director Rafii Makame said the decision was aimed at enforcing the 1988 Newspapers Act under which licencing of journalists falls.  Makame said licencing would be compulsory to both private and state journalists and would cost Tsh6,000 (aboutU$12.00), renewable annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MISA-Tanzania, however, says this is the first time Zanzibar has enforced the licencing of journalists since the Newspapers Act was passed in 1988.  According to MISA-Tanzania, officials claim licencing was delayed due to a lack of a proper board to enforce the Act but the introduction of the department of information services in April last year has now made it possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Located in the Indian Ocean waters, Zanzibar Islands form part of the April 26, 1964, union with mainland Tanzania, called the United Republic of Tanzania. However, Zanzibar still retains internal self-government and can pass legislations independent of mainland Tanzania.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC reiterates its well known commitment to co-operate to the fullest extent of the law with the TRC as part of its contribution towards reconciliation and healing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the ANC, through Deputy President Thabo Mbeki will be making a second submission to the TRC on 12-13 May in Cape Town on its command and control of military operations as well as such other information may please.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - The ANC in KwaZulu Natal regards the statement from the IFP National Council regarding the killings of more than fifty people in Johannesburg and the attempt to storm the Shell House ANC Headquarters on 28 March 1994 as a sign of panic. The IFP has always called for an inquest on the killings of that day. When the inquest is on, they are trying to pre-empt the findings of the inquest by threatening to take drastic actions if the IFP is not satisfied with the findings of the inquest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has always warned that the day all the truth about the events of March 28 1994 comes to the open, the IFP will be embarrassed. The findings of the inquest may decide the question:- Is the IFP an independent political organisation or has its genuine programmes, policies and organisation been so sabotaged that they are really run by the Third Force elements of the former apartheid security forces. In the vain attempt to shift the blame from the IFP, the IFP leadership is beginning to try and disown its march on that day.  The facts indicate that the march was never a Zulu march but that of the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application for the march was filed by Mr Humphrey Ndlovu on behalf of the IFP and not of the Zulu people. The political demands of the marchers were those of the IFP. The IFP is represented by lawyers in the inquest. It is an insult to the Zulu people to refer to the IFP march as a Zulu march.  The IFP reference to its march as the Zulu march is a fiction that was invented after the event.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Dr Ben Ngubane to complain about only murdered IFP leaders is being insensitive. The ANC regards the massacre of about 20 000 people in KwaZulu Natal in the last seventeen years as very serious. Their lives were not less important than those of the murdered ANC or IFP members and leaders. All lives are precious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - GREAT LAKES - Complex Emergency Situation Report 30, Fiscal Year (FY)1997, April 11, 1997. Note: The last situation report was dated April 4,1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporadic ethnic violence against the Banyamulenge and the Banyarwanda, Tutsis of Rwandan origin, has erupted in the South Kivu and Masisi regions of Zaire since 1959. The violence escalated in 1995 and 1996, as the former Rwandan army (the ex-FAR) and the Rwandan Hutu militia (the Interahamwe), living as refugees in Eastern Zaire, attacked the Banyarwanda in the Masisi region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subsequently in October 1996, the Government of Zaire (GOZ) sanctioned harassment of the Banyamulenge in South Kivu, provoking the fighting which broke out between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Banyamulenge rebels on October 14, 1996. The fighting began near Runingo refugee camp in South Kivu, Zaire, forcing about 220,000 refugees to flee the Uvira/Bukavu region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Banyamulenge joined forces with other Zairian rebels to form the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance), led by Laurent Kabila, a veteran foe of Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko.  The fighting spread, moving up the eastern border of Zaire from South Kivu, and south from Rutshuru to Goma, in North Kivu. On November 14, the Alliance counter-attacked against ex-FAR and Interahamwe elements in the Mugunga refugee camp in the Goma area, forcing them to retreat west and compelling hundreds of thousands of refugees to return to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other refugees fled north and west into Zaire and remain there. Since then, Alliance troops have steadily advanced across Eastern Zaire: they captured Kisangani on March 15 and Mbuji-Mayi on April 5, expanding their control to an area 1,600 km long and 600 km west into Zaire. Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire, fell on April 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Humanitarian Assistance for Fiscal Year (FY) 1997 (to date): $131,855, 092</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numbers Affected</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zaire - Refugees: From figures gathered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), about 360,500 Rwandans and 42,000 Burundians are stranded in Eastern Zaire. Of the 100,000 refugees who fled from Tingi-Tingi on March 1 to Ubundu, about 96,000 crossed the Zaire River and have gathered at Km 25, Km 41, and Km 82 on the rail line south of Kisangani. The 57,000 refugees estimated to have gathered near Km 25 are the healthiest, while the 39,000 near Km 41 and 82 are in poor condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From March 17 to April 3, the U.N. airlifted 2,846 refugees from Tingi- Tingi and Amisi to Goma. On April 1, about 20,000 refugees appeared near Karuba, 13 km west of Sake, and by April 9, 16,244 were repatriated to Rwanda, the UNHCR reported. Another 2,500 emerged in Tongo, to the west of the old Katale and Kahindo refugee camps north of Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mbuji-Mayi, Kasai-Oriental, there are reports of 3,000 refugees heading towards Kananga, 140 km to the west, and about 30,000 moving towards Angola.  They are believed to be the group last seen in Shabunda/Kindu. About 100,000 refugees in Eastern Zaire are unaccounted for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire - Internally Displaced (IDPs): 13,000 IDPs are registered in Kisangani. The U.N. estimates there are about 300,000 Zairian IDPs in Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Rwanda: According to the UNHCR, 1,033,405 Rwandan refugees returned to Rwanda from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania from November to December 1996, bringing to 1,300,582 the number of returnees in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From January to March 1997, another 75,947 refugees returned from Eastern Zaire and Tanzania.  There are 9,000 Burundian refugees in Rwanda, the UNHCR reports. There are 3,355 Zairian refugees in Rwanda. In Burundi: Of the 143, 000 Burundian refugees originally in the Uvira area of Zaire, some 93,000 refugees have returned to Burundi. From January through March 1997, 8,192 Burundians returned from Tanzania, and 5,764 returned from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Tanzania: In March, 8,964 Zairian and 5,489 Burundian refugees arrived in the Kigoma region of Tanzania. Recent fighting in Burundi caused 300 refugees to enter Kigoma daily during the first week of April, and on April 6 alone, 800 crossed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In all, there are 276,483 Burundian refugees in Tanzania, and 88,554 Zairians, for a total of 365,037. Elsewhere in the Region: 4,820 Zairians remain in Uganda, according to the UNHCR. About 8,000 Zairian refugees have fled to Zambia. The Government of Sudan is host to 400 Zairian refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zaire Political/Military</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives from the Alliance and the GOZ held talks in South Africa between April 5 and 7. The talks were suspended on April 8, ostensibly to allow the principals to obtain further guidance for a ceasefire agreement.  Attending the talks were Mohammed Sahnoun, U.N. and Organization of African States (OAU) special representative for the Great Lakes, and Thabo Mbeki, deputy president of South Africa. Alliance troops continue their advance in the south, seizing the diamond center of Mbuji-Mayi on April 5 and Kipushi, 30 km west of Lubumbashi, on April 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lubumbashi, the second largest city in Zaire and the key to the nation's mineral wealth, fell on April 9. Alliance leader Kabila subsequently announced a pause in military operations to allow Mobutu to negotiate his departure. In Kinshasa, President Mobutu dismissed Etienne Tshisekedi as prime minister on April 9, a week after his appointment. Mobutu appointed General Likulia Bolongo, the defense minister, as Tshisekedi's replacement.  Mobutu also announced a national state of emergency on the evening of April 8 and appointed military governors for the provinces still in his control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights said in Geneva on April 2 that the Alliance had &quot;undoubtedly&quot; committed massacres during the past six months.  He recommended that an international investigative team be sent to Eastern Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the northern part of Alliance-controlled territory, Alliance officials on April 5 approved a proposal drawn up by the UNHCR for the repatriation of the tens of thousands of Rwandan and Burundian refugees who had fled the Alliance's advances since late 1996. The Alliance's approval came a day after UN agencies issued a public appeal to the rebels, citing the refugees' desperate condition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. plan for repatriating refugees from Eastern Zaire has three parts.  The most urgent, the evacuation of people from Tingi-Tingi and Amisi to Goma, was completed on April 3, after relief workers flew 2,846 very ill and weak refugees to Goma for eventual repatriation to Rwanda. The second and third parts, approved by the Alliance on April 5, involve passenger flights between other parts of Eastern Zaire in Alliance control: Bunia, Kalemie, Kindu, Uvira, Bukavu, Goma, and other accessible airstrips in areas where refugees are located. The final component is arrangements to move the 96,000 refugees grouped along the railroad south of Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR proposes to airlift up to 20,000 of the most vulnerable from Kisangani to Goma, and the healthier refugees would be moved overland. The Alliance is restricting air travel to the Kisangani municipal airport, 5 km north of the city. Relief organizations would prefer to use the international airport, 17 km south of Kisangani, because it can accomodate larger aircraft and, unlike the municipal airport, has offloading equipment. It remains off- limits because the area around the runway is mined. Both airports are on the eastern side of the Zaire River, requiring the refugees to cross it from their concentrations of the western side. The ferry they would use must be repaired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed overland repatriation of the Kisangani area refugees is complicated by the poor condition of the 657 km route from Kisangani to Bukavu, and by the beginning of the rainy season. Whatever route the refugees take on the way from Kisangani to the Rwandan border, they face having to walk part of the route because the 100 km-stretch from Walikale south to Hombo is impassible to vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The refugees in the corridor are grouped near three kilometer markings along the rail line: about 57,000 people at Kasese, near Km 25, and about 31, 000 at Biaro, near Km 41. The Biaro group and the 8,000 refugees at Km 82, are very weak. During the week, mortality rates have sunk sharply as increasing amounts of food, water, and medicines have reached the refugees: early in the week, relief workers said about 120 people, mostly children, died daily; by April 10, the rate had dropped to 20. Relief workers have made the estimated 600 unaccompanied children (UACs) in the Kisangani-Ubundu corridor their priority for airlifting and repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The USAID/DART is travelling regularly between Goma and Kisangani to support relief efforts with the U.N. in determining how best to assist the refugees, local populations, and IDPs.  After the Alliance seized Kisangani on March 15, USAID/DART succeeded in securing the Alliance's clearance for the WFP's first food flight to Kisangani from Mwanza, Tanzania. In recent days, the USAID/DART has worked with the GOR representative for repatriation issues, Alliance and UN officials on the final version of the repatriation plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A group of more than 20,000 Rwandan refugees appeared on March 31 in Karuba, west of Sake, and Tongo, west of the former Katale and Kahindo camps. The refugees, reportedly in good condition, wished to go home. Alliance forces have erected a roadblock near Sake to screen the refugees, and the UNHCR has organized a repatriation that would allow 2,500 people to cross daily into Rwanda from Goma. From March 31 to April 9, 16,244 refugees were repatriated from Karuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports have reached relief agencies of 30,000 refugees heading south from Mbuji-Mayi to the Angolan border. They may be part of the refugees who had fled Shabunda and Kindu earlier this year. In March, the U.N. repatriated 7, 209 refugees from towns in the Goma region, including Kisharu, Tongo, Kalengera/Rugari, Sake/Mugungu, Karuba, and Kalungu. In Kingulube, east of Shabunda, the UNHCR and the World Food Program (WFP) have set up five way stations in preparation for the transit of refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From March 27 to April 8, five trains, each transporting 120 MT of pulses and cereals, made deliveries from Kisangani to the refugees along the railroad. Relief supply trains now run every two to three days. WFP also has five trucks to take food and relief supplies from Kisangani to the refugee concentrations. WFP is trying to contract a second Ilyushin-76 aircraft, to create a fleet of three transports that would deliver 180 MT daily to Kisangani from Mwanza, Tanzania, and Entebbe, Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief efforts to help the Rwandan and Burundian refugees south of Kisangani began to anger local Zairians, whose food and belongings were taken by the ex-FAR/Interahamwe and refugees in the past month. On April 7, Zairian residents outside Kisangani looted 5 MT of food from a WFP truck destined for the refugees. On April 8, local residents detained five trucks in the same place before local authorities resolved the conflict. To lower tensions, relief workers have begun distributing food to local residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance has approved a plan by the ICRC to return by air about 13,000 Zairian IDPs in Kisangani to their homes, via Goma and Bukavu. The operation began on April 7 and has returned 57 UACs to date. The Alliance has not yet granted access to the Bukavu airport. On April 11 the ICRC plans to assess the condition of refugees and several thousand IDPs in the Kalima-Kindu area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As air traffic increases in Eastern Zaire, the British Overseas Development Agency (ODA) is establishing an air logistics cell in Goma and, in coordination with WFP, a transportation unit in Kisangani, which will control air, road, and river movements for the repatriation. Humanitarian agencies are working to alleviate fuel shortages in Goma and Kisangani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwanda Current Situation After the Alliance approved the UNHCR's repatriation proposal on April 5, the GOR's representative for repatriation issues announced that returnees arriving by air from Kisangani would have to use Goma airport instead of Kigali, and then travel overland from the border at Goma, instead of arriving directly by air at Kigali. The refugees will spend several days at Nkamira transit center, where they would be screened before being returned to their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cabinet reshuffle in the GOR on March 28 resulted in the dissolution of the Ministry of Rehabilitation and Social Integration (MiniReiso), with its responsibilities being absorbed by the newly-formed Ministry of the Interior, Communal Development and Social Reintegration. This is significant, as MiniReiso worked most closely with the relief community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC registered a total of 102,446 detainees in Rwanda as of March 31.  Of that number, 63,920 are in prisons and the rest are in communal lock-ups, which the ICRC describes as particularly overcrowded and steadily worsening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts Regular U.N. convoys transporting humanitarian assistance under military escort are underway between Kigali and Cyangugu, Kibuye, Gisenyi, and Ruhengeri. The WFP has also instituted regular flights to Gisenyi and Cyangugu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing circumstances and renewed relief efforts in Eastern Zaire have increased refugee repatriations to Rwanda. WFP has moved 60 MT from the border crossing at La Petite Barri re in Rwanda to Goma, and M'decins Sans Fronti res (MSF) and Food for the Hungry are responsible for administering medical assistance to returnees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite increased nation-wide security measures, a USAID/OFDA officer who travelled by vehicle from Kigali to Gisenyi on April 3-4 noticed few checkpoints and bustling commercial traffic on the main road. At the Nkamira transit center there were about 3,000 refugees who had arrived after crossing the border. Returnees from the Masisi region appeared in better condition than those from Tingi-Tingi and Amisi. From March 26 to April 3, 11,649 refugees were registered in Gisenyi prefecture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The WFP reports that the price of staple foods has increased 30% from the same time last year. The increase resulted from the mass repatriations from Zaire and Tanzania, from poor harvests in Rwanda and southern Uganda, and from the trade embargo against Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political Developments On March 31, state radio announced that 1,400 huts were burned at the Nyarurama regroupment camp in Kayanza province, leaving 14 dead and about 6,000 people without shelter, food, or clothing. WFP is planning an assessment mission to the camp. State radio also announced the death of five &quot;terrorists&quot; in the Gatete sector of Rumonge, Bururi province, on April 3. In Bujumbura, four anti-personnel mines and an anti-tank mine exploded on April 6. It was the third mine incident in the last month: two anti-tank mines exploded in Bujumbura on March 25, killing at least 20 people, and on March 13, three land mines exploded in different parts of Bujumbura, killing seven people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Questions remain unanswered about the Government of the Republic of Burundi (GRB)'s claim that rebels killed 135 people and wounded 144 in Buganda commune, Cibitoke province, on March 19. Government authorities reported on March 13 that a plot to kill Buyoya had been foiled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relief Efforts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March 1996, the GRB began forced regroupment in Karuzi province. One year later, the practice spread to the provinces of Bujumbura Rurale, Bururi, Kayanza, Cibitoke, Bubanza, and Muramvya. Local press reports state that military authorities inform Burundians living in particular areas to move to the regroupment sites. If the peasants do not move to the camps, the military considers them rebels, and they risk being killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although conditions in the camps are satisfactory in the beginning, the health of the population is prone to deteriorate from the effects of crowding, inadequate potable water, poor sanitation, lack of medical care, and inaccessibility to farm land.  Recently the acceleration of forced displacement of the population has imposed a growing burden on the relief community, imperiling their neutrality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 8, the State Department characterized the GRB's regroupment policy as &quot;highly objectionable,&quot; because it disrupts traditional village life and places a vulnerable population at risk of violence, malnourishment, and disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On April 9, a U.S. and U.N. delegation, including the U.S. Ambassador to Burundi, visited three regroupment camps in Karuzi province. They also met with the governor of Karuzi to express the USG's objections to the GRB's regroupment policy, and explained the conditions in which humanitarian assistance would be provided to the camps. The provision of USG assistance in regroupment camps based on these criteria: assistance will not be given immediately upon the formation of the camps; a needs assessment must precede any assistance; aid will be restricted to limited emergency activities; and humanitarian workers' safety and freedom of movement must be guaranteed for the duration of the project.  African leaders will meet in Arusha on April 16 to evaluate the effect of the sanctions against Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders will examine the measures taken by the GRB towards establishing democracy, peace, and reconciliation, to determine progress made in these areas. For the first time, Major Buyoya, the Burundian leader, has been invited to the session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of March 31, there were 365,037 refugees in Tanzania: 276,488 of them Burundian; the rest Zairian, the UNHCR reported. The populations are as follows: Ngara camps: 97,600; Kibondo camps: 104,411. Both areas hold only Burundians. In the Kasulu area: 117,478, including 44,204 Zairians; Kigoma camps: 44,350 refugees, almost all Zairian. Fighting in Bururi and Makamba provinces in Burundi generated about 300 Burundian refugees a day during the first week of April, and 800 entered on April 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late March, on the other hand, factional fighting among Burundian refugees in the Ngara camps resulted in 2,169 returnees. About 4,000 Zairian refugees requested repatriation from the Kigoma camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USG Assistance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BHR/OFDA deployed a USAID/DART to Kigali, Rwanda from October 26, 1996 to February 26, 1997, and an assessment team to Zaire from February 12-26, 1997.  The current USAID/DART was deployed to Nairobi on March 14 and is working in the region. The USAID/DART has installed an information officer in Nairobi and field offices in Goma and Kisangani.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has issued its first subpoenas requiring supporters of liberation movements to appear at investigative inquiries of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Robert McBride and Ms Greta Appelgren -- as she was then known -- have been called to appear before the Commission in Durban from April 21. They were convicted of offences arising out of the bombing of Magoo's Bar, Durban.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The subpoenas were served at Easter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Archbishop Desmond Tutu, chairperson of the Commission, said in a statement today:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr McBride was told in his subpoena that he would face questions which relate to 'your involvement in, role and/or knowledge of the bombing of Magoo's Bar at Marine Parade, Durban, on 14 June 1985, including but not confined to the extent of the involvement of the military and political wing of the African National Congress (MK) in the planning and execution of the aforesaid bombing...'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ms Appelgren will be questioned on the same incident. The subpoenas were issued by our Durban office in terms of Section 29 of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, which grants the Commission the power to call upon any person to appear before the Commission to give evidence or to answer questions relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the same section under which a number of former police generals were subpoenaed late last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The law provides that &quot;no person other than a member of the staff of the Commission or any person required... to give evidence shall be entitled or permitted to attend any hearing conducted in terms of this section (of the Act).&quot; However, the Commission is able to release information about Section 29 hearings at its discretion, or at subsequent public hearings of the Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In terms of Section 34 of the Act, any person who is subpoenaed is entitled to appoint a legal representative. If he is not financially capable of doing so, the Commission may appoint a legal representative to assist him or her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Section 39 of the Act provides for penalties for any person who fails to appear in response to a subpoena without sufficient cause, or who 'fails or refuses to answer fully and satisfactorily to the best of his or her knowledge and belief any question lawfully put to him or her...' Those guilty of offences in terms of the Act are liable to fines and/or imprisonment of up to two years.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to President Frederick Chiluba, president of the Republic of Zambia, April 10, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to strongly protest the government legislated Media Council of Zambia (MCZ) Bill presented on April 7, 1997. The bill sets the minimum age for practicing journalism at 18 years and requires that all journalists hold a degree in mass communication, or a degree recognized by the council in conjunction with two years training as a journalists or proof of having written articles for a media institution recognized by the council.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local and foreign journalists are required to be accredited annually by the MCZ, a body appointed by the minister of information and pay an accreditation fee. In addition, the proposed bill provides the Media Council with sweeping powers to reprimand, suspend, expel, convict, sentence and or fine journalists who have not complied with the requirements for accreditation and discipline in their profession, or who have been accused by aggrieved members of the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan organization of journalists committed to the defense of our colleagues' rights worldwide, CPJ protests the spirit and particulars of the media council bill and condemns the state's attempt through this bill to restrict press freedom in blatant violation of all journalists' right to hold and express opinions and ideas. CPJ particularly protests the proposal that the Media Council serve as a prosecutor and judge in cases when the public files a complaint against a journalist and/or media house thereby circumventing an independent judicial process and violating journalists' right to a free and fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rights undermined by the Media Council bill are guaranteed by Article 19 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, and the 1991 Windhoek Declaration on Promoting an Independent and Pluralistic African Press, all to which, we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Zambia is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We strongly urge Your Excellency to do everything in your power dismiss the repressive proposed Media Council bill. Moreover, we urge the state to cooperate with local journalists in efforts to realize the recommendations of the Media Reform Committee of 1993 for sweeping changes in the laws governing the media and to ensure that press freedom is legally protected in Zambian law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - On Saturday, April 12, hundreds of journalists in Lusaka went on a demonstration against government's plans to legislate for a Media Council, reports the Zambia Independent Media Association (ZIMA/MISA-Zambia).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demonstration aimed at raising public awareness about the impact of the proposed Media Council of Zambia (MCZ) on the public's right to freedom of expression. ZIMA says marching journalists were joined by the general public and representatives of non-governmental organisations. The governement- intiated media council bill seeks, among others, to licence journalists and imposes jail terms on those practising without one.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ZIMA marchers from the state and private media chanted anti- media council slogans, carried placards with messages which read: &quot;Lobby your MP - media council act is draconian&quot;; &quot;Honk for a free press&quot;; &quot;It's your right to write&quot;. They also distributed fliers with messages saying: &quot;Do not be held hostage by your own government&quot;; Everybody has a right to know, a legislated media council abrogates that right.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Demonstrators were later addressed by the chairman of the Media Liason Committee (MLC) Robby Makayi, participating NGOs and an opposition party leader. Makayi told demonstrators that by going ahead with its plans, the government was in contempt of the 1995 High Court order which awarded PAZA a &quot; stay of execution&quot; - preventing the government from legislating for a Media Association of Zambia (MAZ) to replace PAZA. As a result of this possible contempt, he said, MLC has initiated legal proceedings against the government.  Makayi also lauched a &quot;peoples' petition&quot; which he said would be distributed countrywide to be signed by members of the public in support of the withdrawal of the MCZ bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NGOs' leaders and the oppositon parties also condemned the government for its intentions to legislate for a media council. They said such a move would be an infringement of basic human right to freedom of expression. Meanwhile, a similar march in the Copperbelt town of Kitwe failed to take place because journalists there were denied police permission to march. But a gathering crowd was addressed by an official from the Zambia Union of Journalists (ZUJ) who also condemned the proposed law. ends</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PART II - DETAILS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EAST AFRICA: REGIONAL OPERATION FOR BURUNDI, RWANDA, ZAIRE, TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. ZAIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Relief agencies are finalising preparations for a large-scale evacuation programme for the Rwandan refugees stranded in eastern Zaire. The Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL) authorities have now agreed to the evacuation of an estimated 80,000-100,000 refugees and to the use of Kisangani airport. This complex evacuation operation, which includes the return of internally displaced persons to the Goma area, will involve the use of trucks, train, barges and planes. UNHCR is currently discussing with Rwandan authorities the details for the reception of the most vulnerable refugees, who are to be evacuated by air to either Kigali or Goma. WFP is offering the use of three planes, two Illyushins and a Hercules, for this programme. Update: the operation began on 11 April, when 205 internally displaced persons were flown by WFP from Kisangani to Goma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP has continued deliveries of food to the refugees who are presently accommodated at Kasese, km 29 south of Kisangani and Biaro, km 39, and other locations further south along the Kisangani/Ubundu railroad line. In addition to rail and truck despatches from Kisangani to the concentration points, and the ongoing air bridge from Mwanza, Tanzania, a new air operation started on 7 April from Entebbe to Kisangani, with two planes, one Illyushin-76 and one Hercules C-130. With these two air bridges, WFP can shuttle to Kisangani 110 mt of food, and some essential medical supplies, daily. During the first week of April, WFP airlifted 270 mt of food supplies into Kisangani. The refugees continue to require urgent food and medical assistance and the death rate, although declining, remains high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.3 The evacuation programme from Karuba is still ongoing. An average 2,000 to 3,000 Rwandans are being taken by truck to Gisenyi every day. At Sake, the ADFL rebels have established a check-point for screening the passing refugees.  As of 9 April there were still some 15,000 refugees left at Karuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. RWANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Repatriation from Zaire increased over the past week, as expected.  During the first week of April, 14,057 persons were registered by UNHCR, mostly returnees arriving through Gisenyi, including 325 unaccompanied children, housed at Nkamira Transit Centre. This centre holds around 7,000 persons, awaiting transportation to their communes. The returnees are receiving one month's food ration before returning to their home areas. Sick and malnourished returnees receive extra food. To date, 25 of these recent returnees have died in Gisenyi hospital due to extreme exhaustion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 From 31 March to 6 April, WFP distributed 3,350 mt of food in Rwanda.  Current stocks in the country amount to 5,579 mt of various commodities. Due to a reduction in rail despatch capacity from Mombasa, over 2,500 mt of maize and beans are being trucked directly from the port to Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. BURUNDI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.1 A UN/NGO mission comprising WFP, UNHCR, FAO and OXFAM, visited Cibitoke province, in the north-western part of the country. During the last half of 1996, insecurity did not allow any UN staff to travel to Cibitoke and the present mission had to travel with heavy military escort. The mission visited a regroupement site holding mostly persons who returned from Zaire in November 1996. Owing to insecurity, the population does not have access to land and coping mechanisms have not yet been developed. Meeting with the mission, the Governor stated that 100,000 people, or 60 percent of the population of Cibitoke province, are now grouped in sites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. TANZANIA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.1 Heavy rains have arrived in Kigoma, making many roads impassable and affecting all relief operations. Five WFP trucks got stuck in Kasulu during operations to build up stocks in refugee camps. The Government, UN agencies and NGOs involved in assistance to refugees are carrying out spot maintenance, but donor funding will be necessary to ensure that all the work needed can be completed. Fortunately, food stocks had been pre-positioned at all camps by WFP, and are sufficient to meet requirements for two weeks in Lugufu and four weeks in Kasulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.2 The influx of Burundian refugees into Kigoma region is now reduced to 100-150 persons per day. Nevertheless, during the last weekend of March, 800 refugees arrived in Kasulu. At the same time, some 3,000 Zairean refugees have requested to be repatriated to Uvira. Contingency plans are being made for an organised return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.3 WFP participated in a Government/UN-organised helicopter visit to Lindi, to assess the damage caused by recent flooding, which has exacerbated hardship already caused by the drought. Some one thousand families were left homeless and in urgent need of shelter, food and medicine. WFP is planning an airlift from Ngara, scheduled to start on 10 April, to deliver emergency food rations and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.4 On 8 April WFP approved an emergency operation (EMOP 5825) to assist 200,000 people facing food shortages due to the failure of the short rains.  Under this operation, WFP will provide 10,080 mt of food commodities, at a value of USD 2.6 million. The food will be distributed by NGOs through direct feeding or food-for-work activities in the eleven regions identified as needing relief aid. The total cost of this operation is USD 4.2 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.5 The Government has provided another 10,000 mt in drought relief. An additional 14,000 mt of food is required for distribution during the coming months. Donor contributions of TZ Shillings 800 million (approximately USD 1.  4 million) would allow the Government to deliver an additional 30,000 mt of food commodities to the markets, thus ensuring that those in need who still have some purchasing power can have access to food at reasonable prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">C. UGANDA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. UPDATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 A joint Rapid Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment is presently being carried out in ten of the districts of the country reported to be facing acute food shortages as a result of the drought. Following an initial assessment made by the Government and the subsequent request for food assistance, WFP immediately delivered 330 mt of cereals for distribution to the most affected populations in Kumi, Tororo and Soroti districts. The present four-team assessment mission comprises WFP, the Government and donor representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Between 180,000-185,000 displaced Ugandans were identified after consolidation of the registration exercise conducted in Gulu district. A similar exercise has been carried out in Kitgum and final figures are expected soon. Security in these two districts, particularly in Kitgum, has recently deteriorated and food distribution to internally displaced persons in the northern part of the district bordering Sudan had to be postponed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">D. SUDAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. JUBA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Following the recent upsurge in fighting in south Sudan, further numbers of displaced persons and returning refugees have gathered in Juba. A reported 8,400 recently arrived people in the city (returnees from Uganda and Zaire) require immediate assistance. An additional 10,000 to 15,000 Sudanese refugees from camps in northern Uganda are on the road from Yei to Juba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 WFP has initiated an airlift operation into Juba to deliver a total of 200 mt of food. On the first day of the airlift, 10 April, 30 mt of sorghum were delivered, the first relief food to reach Juba since early February. WFP has deployed staff to Juba to monitor food distribution. The Norwegian Church Council will deliver a further 300 mt of food by air. In addition, Government of Sudan and SPLA clearance has been obtained to deliver 2,500 mt of relief food to Juba on a barge convoy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. YEI</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 As previously reported, the fall of Yei and Kajo Keji towns to the SPLA has led to the mass exodus of Sudanese refugees from northern Uganda. A WFP/Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) food security assessment mission to Yei and Kajo Keji counties took place from 27 March to 5 April. A total of 100, 000 returning refugees from northern Uganda and vulnerable persons among the resident population in Yei were identified as requiring urgent relief food and non-food assistance, including agricultural inputs. The most vulnerable group comprises 13,500 displaced residents of Yei town, whose only current available access to food is through relief support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.2 During February and March, WFP purchased 300 mt of locally produced sorghum which have been distributed to over 17,000 internally displaced persons and returnees in Mundri, Meridi and Yambio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.3 On 30 March, WFP delivered an initial 40 mt of maize to Yei. An additional 20 mt is en route and expected to arrive in Yei 12 April. OLS relief assistance will concentrate on promoting a strategy for self-reliance, with food aid response closely linked to agricultural inputs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Three years ago, the Government agreed to establish a judicial world-first in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the initiative of Mr Kahn's office, two special victim-friendly courts were set up to help eradicate the secondary victimisation of women and children exposed to sexual abuse and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mr Kahn, the Children's Court in Cape Town and the Sexual Offences Court in Wynberg have gone a long way in relieving the problem of further victimisation experienced by rape survivors and children who have suffered abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The courts had attracted a vast amount of interest overseas, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project has been hailed a success, but Mr Kahn's pleas to take it further have fallen on deaf ears. His office has had to wage a battle to establish more special courts against a ponderous bureaucracy, with little support from the Department of Justice, in spite of the &quot;undoubted success&quot; of the first two courts since 1993. The Justice Department had been slow in committing itself to extending the pilot project, he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every year I have made the same pleas in my parliamentary report to set up a network of these courts and I have been kicked to touch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They have been long in the tooth about expanding on the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are slowly coming on stream, but we would like them to approach it holistically. After one year, we should have expanded the idea as the pilot courts have more than proved themselves. Instead, it has taken almost four years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major breakthrough for the Attorney-General's office last year was accommodation becoming available for the setting up of a new children's court in Parow, and this will be operational in August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new development has been welcomed by Shifra Jacobson, director of Resources Aimed at the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (Rapcan), but she said it fell far short of what was urgently needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said special courts had to be set up in all areas of the Peninsula - and throughout the country - if the judicial system was to improve its handling of cases involving abused children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report compiled by the SA Police Service's child protection unit said that a child was raped every five minutes in this country. Crimes against youngsters occurred every two minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Parow court will be the second one dealing exclusively with child abuse cases and will reduce the huge burden of cases from the northern suburbs dealt with by the pilot children's court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The success of these courts is measured by the extent to which the trauma experienced by victims of abuse on appearing in court is reduced. The important factor is that they are victim-orientated,&quot; said Mr Kahn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is pleading with the Department of Justice for more special courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not that costly to set them up. All we need for one of these courts is a hall, a magistrate and two prosecutors,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have had moral support from all corners of the world and all sectors of the community, except where it counts - from the Department of Justice. What we want is some commitment there.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The caseloads of the pilot courts are so heavy that more special courts are desperately needed in Athlone, Mitchell's Plain, Wynberg, Paarl and George. &quot; There should be a network of these courts throughout the Peninsula,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We look forward to starting a second sexual offences court in Wynberg, depending on the commitment of the Department of Justice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accommodation has become available in Wynberg and it will be a matter of allocating staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Justice spokesman Paul Setsetse said that during his term of office Minister Dullah Omar had established 130 court facilities countrywide for victims of sexual abuse and was in the process of setting up another 70.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For the first time, sex-related cases can be heard without the victims becoming frustrated when having to appear in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most magistrate's courts have established a friendly environment for sexual-abuse cases. The minister has always called for victims of this type of abuse to be shown sympathy and treated sensitively in court,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Mr Omar had initiated interaction between magistrates, prosecutors and victims of abuse to improve the manner in which these cases and the complainants were dealt with in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But everything depends on finance and the minister indicated these problems could not be solved overnight. What little we could do, we have done.  We have never had such facilities available before,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rapcan's Ms Jacobson said the Children's Court and Sexual Offences Court had helped children tremendously because they offered protection from the perpetrators of abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The young victims did not appear in court. They were kept out of sight in a separate room with an intermediary who relayed information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel that's a great improvement. The courts have provided a child- friendly space,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there were not enough Xhosa-speaking intermediaries to deal with the sheer volume of Xhosa-speaking victims who appeared in court. Nor were there enough children's courts. The two pilot courts had a backlog of six to 12 months and the waiting period was to the detriment of the young victims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We very strongly believe children should not have to appear in open court but they do because of the backlog of cases,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The long wait affects their statements, their memory and the impact the abuse has had on their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We need children's courts in all areas, especially Khayelitsha, Guguletu and Nyanga. At the moment, these children have to travel to Cape Town or Wynberg.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the conviction rate in these cases was still unacceptably low.  Children were subjected to the cautionary laws in which they were viewed as unreliable witnesses. Aspects of the legal system were still prejudiced against children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has to be more training of prosecutors and magistrates to understand the impact of abuse on children, the trauma it renders. Children also need access to counselling prior to the court case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kahn said the new children's court to be set up in Parow was a step in the right direction towards fighting child abuse, but frustrating problems remained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the child protection unit did not function in areas where child abuse was most rife - such as Khayelitsha, Mitchell's Plain, Nyanga, Langa and Guguletu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result was that investigations were not done efficiently and people who lodged complaints of child abuse with police did not get the same service as those in areas where the unit functioned, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shortage of police vehicles hindered work in this regard and referrals by local police stations to the child protection unit were seldom if ever followed up, said Mr Kahn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Xhosa-speaking areas, there was a shortage of interpreters to act as intermediaries and his office was looking into using unemployed or retrenched teachers for this purpose. Many of the child abuse cases heard in the city children's court in 1996 were crimes committed in the Bellville, Goodwood and Kuils River magisterial districts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, recent figures showed that most rape cases were lodged with police in Mitchell's Plain, Goodwood, Khayelitsha and Guguletu, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tilly Brouwer, marketing director of the National Council for Child and Family Welfare, said rape and abuse of children was &quot;way out of control. It's a moral outrage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statistics of child abuse represented only the tip of the iceberg, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The child protection unit's report showed a 108% increase in crimes against children under 18 since 1993. Crimes included rape, sodomy, incest, indecent assault, other sexual offences, attempted murder, abduction, kidnapping and public indecency. However, these figures referred only to reported cases handled by the unit and specialised individuals. Last year alone, there were over 20 000 cases of sexual crimes and 8 500 assaults on children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These statistics are a national disgrace,&quot; said Mr Brouwer. &quot;It is a shame that our children are treated in this way. But as more cases are being reported, it seems our nation is becoming more caring about our future generation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It costs at least R6 000 a year for therapeutic services for one abused child and the cost of caring for a baby is R17 500 a year, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The calls for help have not been ignored in the Western Province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Kahn said: &quot;We have done a considerable amount of work together with the moral support of non-governmental organisations such as Rapcan and Rape Crisis, but the pressure we have applied has been ignored for so long.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the years, promises have surfaced only when it became expedient to do so. Everyone pays lip service to the issue and my pleas have fallen on deaf ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These developments haven't come easy. Even now, I've had to go with cap in hand to social welfare.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The go-ahead for the Parow court has been a major victory for his office. &quot; It has shown this province takes the issue of rape seriously,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two courts have drawn the interest of the Zimbabwean government, which has requested prosecutorial assistance to establish its own victim-friendly courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a pity that something as tragic as what occurred on Robben Island must give this impetus, when we have been knocking on the door since 1992 to establish the first two courts,&quot; said Mr Kahn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But at last the Department of Justice was becoming more amenable to the idea of the special courts, he added.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - When Rayda Jacobs returned to her roots in Cape Town &quot;for good&quot; after a 27-year exile in Canada she little knew she would bring a long-held dream to fruition by scooping a South African English literature prize for her first novel, Eyes of the Sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Rayda modestly says she is &quot;just a story-teller&quot; some critics have compared her literary flair and style to top writers like Andr Brink and Nobel prizewinner for literature Nadine Gordimer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rayda, who penned her first story at the age of 12 and submitted it to Springbok Radio, has been awarded this year's Herman Charles Bosman prize of R7 500 for English literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is the first recipient of the prize introduced by Nasionale Boekhandel, a publishing house with several autonomous subsidiary publishers. Books from several authors were submitted for the coveted prize which will be presented to her in Gauteng on April 24.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview at her Lakeside home soon after returning from her daily walk on Muizenberg beach with her two dogs - a Siberian husky and a Belgian shepherd - she said the award was a &quot;great welcome back present&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of her house, which she described as the perfect setting for her writing, she said she had always wanted a house nestling at the foot of a mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found my ideal home here in Lakeside,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While taking my dogs for their daily outing it also gives me the opportunity to be close to nature and enables me to meditate and to formulate ideas for my writing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of her writing, she says: &quot;I was virtually forced to emigrate to Canada and felt I had to write about the land of my birth to forgive myself. Naturally, like any aspirant local writer, I would like one day to write the Great South African novel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On arrival in Lakeside two years ago I found an almost starved and virtually non-existent literary scene, so I started my own weekly writers' and poetry-reading sessions to stimulate writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I am not glued to my word processor, I manage to play a bit of Scrabble or even pursue my other hobbies like gardening - or fly my 1,3 metre kite.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her novel, set in the 18th century in a desolate area of the Cape interior, is about identity, betrayal, forbidden love and the coming together of diverse cultures vying for the scant resources of an arid land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically it tells the saga of the early people of the Cape, who were here first, those who came after and why people did what they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most importantly, I wanted to give the people that I have most affection for - the Bushmen - a proper place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wanted to show their ways, customs, how they lived, what they had to do to survive and what a gentle people they are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things were not always so rosy for Rayda - and she vividly recalls her uphill struggle in pursuing her chosen career after she was uprooted from Diep River, the suburb where she lived and attended school, when it was reserved exclusively for whites under the draconian Group Areas Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident and subsequent events fostered an abhorrence of South Africa's apartheid policies which was compounded when she had a run-in with the law over Race Classification legislation before she turned 21. When faced with the certainty of a head-on confrontation with the police if she remained, she opted to emigrate to Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't want to go, but I had no choice really. I left very reluctantly after celebrating my 21st birthday. But all that is behind me now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After settling in Toronto she married an Iranian and bore him a son, Faramarz, and daughter, Zaida, and pursued her great love - writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her husband objected to this and it eventually contributed to the break-up of the marriage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her second marriage, to an Egyptian, was childless and also ended in divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After going through the trauma of two divorces, she has demonstrated her resilience by continuing her literary career.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her first book, called The Middle Children, was a partly autobiographical and partly fictional collection of interrelated short stories focusing on South Africans of mixed race in the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was published in Canada in 1994 - 12 months before she returned to Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While she still refers to herself as a South African-born Canadian because she believes Canada is very much part of her, she says her roots have been, and always will be, in Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She explains: &quot;I never put down anchors in Canada because I didn't go there willingly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My heart remained in the Cape and so did my love for the indigenous people of the Cape - with whom I will always associate myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wrote my novel in Toronto, did my research there, came to Cape Town in 1994 for a six-week holiday to meet some Bushmen at Kagga Kamma in the Cederberg Mountains. My book is dedicated to Oupa Regopstan - in memory of the oldest Bushman in South Africa. I interviewed him on video camera 12 months before he died.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her latest collection of short stories, Postcards from South Africa, deals with present-day South Africa in the post-apartheid era and she is busy with her second novel - about Cape slaves a few years before emancipation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Cape Town's Community Olympic Forum is to help emergent black- owned businesses take advantage of special tendering procedures for multi- million rand bid-related projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of small businesses and new contractors have come forward since the Cape Argus published a report last week on the introduction of an &quot; affirmative procurement policy&quot; devised specifically to target emergent enterprises from the previously disadvantaged sector. For many of them the tendering formalities are daunting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project management consultancy Amsa which is responsible for managing the seven projects said new businesses wanting to compete for work on these projects would be given advance warning of the tender calls and that leaflets spelling out how to tender would be distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week the Community Olympic Forum, representing wide-ranging civic and community organisations, said it would also help new and small businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forum chairperson Brian Williams, former unionist and now director of the Department of Labour in the Western Cape, said: &quot;Small businesses and people who feel they have the skills and could contribute to these projects should contact the forum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than following the customary route of drawing up a single tender to cover an entire project which means only big companies are able to submit tenders, then sub-contract portions of the work the Olympic priority projects are being split up into as many as 20 &quot;tender packages&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Roofing or electrical work, for instance, will be advertised as a tender package separate from the structural steel work or concrete construction elements of the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects for which tenders are to be called shortly are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a softball facility at the Turfhall Sports Complex in Athlone (R10- million);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a Belhar community, sports and recreation hall, earmarked for judo during the Olympics (R18,25-million);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a multi-purpose hall for boxing in Langa (R5-million);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an indoor multi-purpose hall in Philippi East, earmarked for badminton in 2004 (R18-million);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an indoor multi-purpose hall in Mew Way, Khayelitsha, earmarked for boxing (R16,7-million);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* a multi-purpose hall in Scottsdene, also earmarked for boxing (R2-million, in this case a contribution from the Cape Metropolitan Council); and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* an outdoor training facility for baseball in Grassy Park (R2-million).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project managers at Amsa can be reached at 21 2363 and Mr Williams of the Community Olympic Forum can be reached at 460 5170.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A top European investor is planning to pump nearly R500-million into the hotel and catering industry in the Muizenberg area, says Western Cape Economic Affairs Minister Chris Nissen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with the Cape Argus, Mr Nissen said he would not name the company because negotiations were &quot;at a sensitive stage&quot;. The minister secured the investment during a visit to three European countries last month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other investments secured during the trip include R90-million for the upgrading of a city centre hotel, R60-million towards the establishment of a metal cap manufacturing plant by a French investor and R90-million for a company specialising in low-cost housing materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the trip we told them the Western Cape was an area they could come and invest in because we have the infrastructure and the environment,&quot; Mr Nissen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Undivco group of France planned to open a plant manufacturing panels used in low-cost housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Masilly group, also of France, would invest in the metal cap manufacturing plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cap manufacturing plant would be established in Blue Downs, Mitchell's Plain or Atlantis. A decision still had to be made about its location.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hotel would probably be in the central business district. The investor, whom he would not name, would &quot;probably buy an existing hotel and revamp it&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nissen did not rule out joint ventures by the European investors with local companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the investors will probably team up with local companies and of course we encourage them to do that,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nissen added that nearly 600 jobs would be created as a result of the investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister has always insisted that only investments that create jobs will be considered by the provincial government and his ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that it would probably take three months for the companies to enter the country and make the investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape is aiming to attract R16-billion in investments from overseas by the end of year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An official in Mr Nissen's office said the province had attracted nearly R13-billion in investments this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a very realistic target and we are confident that we will meet it,&quot; said the official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announcement of the intention by the four companies to invest in the province went a long way towards meeting that target, Mr Nissen said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Talks are continuing this week to rescue Cape Town's Olympic strategic environmental assessment, which is running way behind schedule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows delays in finalising the contract between the Bid Company and specialist consultants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study appeared to be in the balance last week, when the consultants said they were reviewing their approach and were not ready to sign the contract.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the week the Bid Company committed itself to the next phase of the assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Shandler of the assessment team said the two sides had met at the weekend and had made progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm hoping we will be able to resolve this within the next few days,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Shandler said: &quot;A considerable amount of time has passed since our appointment, and although phase one of the study has been completed, the context and conditions have changed, and we are having to re-look at our approach given these changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would certainly like to see the assessment going ahead,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study is intended to provide an independent assessment of the short- and long-term implications of the bid, and is one of the &quot;minimum requirements&quot; negotiated between the company and the environmental sector for environmentalists' role in the bid process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another of the requirements negotiated between the company and the environmentalists is an independent poll to test public opinion on whether the bid should continue, based on the results of the study. Details of how the poll is to be conducted have yet to be decided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study is to assess the bid in terms of economic performance, small business opportunities, public finance, public involvement, urban development, transport, nation-building, job creation, price effects, institutional capacity, population growth effects, housing, sport needs and the promotion of sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the original programme, the strategic assessment should have been commissioned in February, a draft working report produced by March, a review drafted by April or May and the final report by the end of May.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - All is not well in the tourism industry, particularly in the Western Cape, where growth has been well below full potential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demise of Cape Town hotels over the past two decades or so - remember old landmarks like the President, the Elizabeth and the Clifton on the Atlantic seaboard - has been reversed with a proliferation of establishments under construction or in the planning stages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Table Bay at the Waterfront has just opened, several international chains are building on the Foreshore, hotels at Mouille Point and Hout Bay are planned and work is well under way on the controversial hotel on the White House site at Oudekraal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are just a few of the major developments in the mainstream accommodation industry which has also been bolstered in recent years by literally hundreds of bed and breakfasts and guesthouses as Cape Town gears itself for a major tourism boom and possibly hosting the 2004 Olympics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a new word of caution comes in the latest issue of the monthly newsletter Tourism Info which warns that all is not well in the industry and that the Western Cape in particular should be gravely concerned about tourist figures for the 1996-1997 summer holiday season which were relatively poor and far below potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journal reports that debate about the reasons has thrown up several possible causes, one being too high hotel prices, and warns that waning visitor numbers can only aggravate problems for the hotel industry with all the new hotels and resorts planned in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lot is happening in the industry with the restructuring of Satour and the setting up of the SA Tourism Business Council which will be working hard to reverse the trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But developers and operators of hotels would do well to heed the warning bells and take care to offer service and value for money, not to oversaturate the market, and to beware of competition from destinations which are closer for travellers from North America, Europe and the East.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A clampdown aimed at ending taxi violence in the Peninsula began today when scores of minibus taxi drivers were stopped and fined for not displaying stickers showing their approved routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Town traffic department concentrated on the Cape Town station deck taxi rank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation, which began at 7am, will carry on indefinitely. It follows a government announcement of stringent measures to regulate the taxi industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A traffic officer said minibus taxi operators had had ample warning and had been given two grace periods in the past two months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several drivers who were fined said the stickers were not fair. They threatened to disrupt the public transport system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the traffic officer said all operators with roadworthy vehicles and the required permits had been issued with stickers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Days were numbered for illegal operators who tainted the minibus taxi industry by creating chaos and strife, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, the army and traffic police are teaming up to enforce the law requiring minibuses to display the stickers. Operators without stickers were fined R150 but those without permits got fines up to R600.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be charged in the Cape High Court in August with fraud involving R5,7-million and theft of R3,1-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak, former head of the Foundation for Peace and Justice, is accused of using R1,1-million of the foundations's money for personal use, and Mr Steenkamp allegedly used R1,3-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge sheet was formally handed in at the court today. Dr Boesak and Mr Steenkamp face 32 charges, 12 of fraud and 20 of theft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freddie Steenkamp appeared in court this morning and the case was postponed to August 4. He was not asked to plead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate's Court on March 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are alleged to have defrauded the Coca-Cola Foundation by misrepresenting to the foundation that they needed $50 000 for the Caravan Project in Carnarvon and Van Wyksvlei in the Karoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They allegedly failed to disclose to the foundation that the money was to be used to obtain overseas loans for the Cross Times Trust. Dr Boesak allegedly said it would be used for the Caravan project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be charged with fraud in that the Children's Trust allegedly only received R423 000 of R682 000 received from American singer Paul Simon for the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be charged with theft for allegedly using part of this money to clear the foundation's overdraft instead, without the permission of the trustees of the Children's Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be charged with stealing the balance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will be charged with stealing money donated by Swedish aid agency Sida for an audiovisual project to make 12 videos. Sida donated R762 000 for the videos for rural voter education. The money was allegedly used to build a studio for Dr Boesak's wife, Elna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boesak allegedly misrepresented to Sida what he was to use the money for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and Mr Steenkamp face seven charges of fraud relating to misrepresentations in the foundation's annual financial statements from 1988 to 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges allege parts of their expenses were allocated to projects by way of journal entries in order to hide from donors and trustees of the foundation the high cost of salaries, transport and staff loans.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - The International Monetary Fund has asked Uganda to stop offering tax holidays to investors and instead extend to them generous initial investment allowances, the New Vision newspaper reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper said Ulrike Wilson, the fund's resident representative in Kampala said Monday the Fund had already expressed its opposition on tax holidays to the Uganda government saying they offer many &quot;giveaways.&quot; She said tax holidays robbed the economy of resources, thus leaving investment allowances as the appropriate tool since they are offered selectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tax holidays are not an efficient way of encouraging new investments. They are granted to everyone,&quot; she told the local NewsLine newspaper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we prefer instead of tax holidays is for instance a very generous initial investment allowance. That is something that targets at attracting new investments,&quot; she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did not, however, elaborate on the form of investment allowances although sources say it involves reduction in corporate taxes during the initial investment period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda is in the process of reviewing its investment laws, and it is likely the donor's idea will not be considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say tax holidays have been instrumental in attracting investment to the country for the last six years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Uganda Investment Authority says at least 2,400 projects worth 3.249 billion U.S. dollars have been licensed since July 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investments worth 1.233 billion dollars are said to have either taken off or are in the final stages of completion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials at the Ministry of Planning, under which the investment authority falls say, however, the IMF position, if adopted, would make the country less attractive for foreign investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall resist this position in the investment law. It is less attractive compared to tax holidays,&quot; said an official, who did not want to be identified by name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a local investor making new investments of at least 50,000 dollars and a foreign entrepreneur making capital investments or an equivalent in capital goods worth 500,000 were eligible to tax exemptions of between three to five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Bowing to pressure from journalists, the Zambian government has suspended its decision to table a controversial media council draft bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, the country's information and broadcasting services minister, David Mpamba, said on Tuesday that the bill has been suspended to provide an opportunity for debate and exchange of views with stakeholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpamba said government took the measure because the draft bill which was published as a discussion paper had generated considerable debate and emotion among media practitioners and the general public.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed bill which has been rejected by journalists has been the center of heated debate in the country since its publication last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill has also been opposed by the London-based Commonwealth Press Union (CPU), the International Press Institute and some donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his statement, Mpamba regretted that some diplomats accredited to Zambia have taken it upon themselves to issue very crude instructions to the government on the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 200 Zambian journalists from both the government and private media on Saturday staged a demonstration in Lusaka to oppose the plan to legalize the media council, which is aimed at controlling the work of journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists maintained that the rejection of the media council was non- negotiable and to discuss the bill would mean to legitimize what the government wants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The media council bill, published in a local daily a week ago, seeks to regulate media organisations. It envisages the compulsory registration of journalists, to set minimum qualifications for them. It will also institute a disciplinary body for media practitioners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The council will have the power to reprimand, suspend or withdraw accreditation to offending journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To practice, journalists must have attained the age of 18, hold a bachelor's degree in Arts or Mass Communication obtained from a university or institution recognized by the council. Journalists will also be required to have completed at least two years training in journalism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meles' visit and talks with leading business concerns in Rome and Florence also resulted in two Italian companies signing agreements on joint ventures in a steel mill and granite INL002 from SSS.089 (970415-18:04) QN PANAINL .  PANADKR MSG088G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) production, the Ethiopian Herald reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The premier returned home Saturday night. His 70-member entourage included some 50 business people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy agreed to provide Ethiopia with 40 million dollars for the construction of a 260-km rural road, connecting the town of Debrework, in East Gojjam Province, north-western Ethiopia, with Kombolcha, through Mekaneselam, both in South Wollo Province, in Central Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Italy is to provide Ethiopia with 19 million dollars long-term, low-interest loan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over 80 Italian entrepreneurs in Rome and in Florence were said to have shown interest to invest in Ethiopia. Two companies signed joint ventures for establishing a small-scale steel mill for producing building and engineering structures, and for mining granites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian foreign minister, Seyoum Mesfin, and his Italian counterpart, Lamberto Dini, also signed cooperation agreements between the two countries on investment guarantees and avoidance of double taxation as well as on cultural cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter includes the return to Ethiopia of the 24-meter high Axum Obelisk, carted away in 1937 from the northern Ethiopian historic city of Axum on the personal orders of the fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Italy is to bear the cost of transportation of the obelisk and for replanting in at its original site, where Axumite artisans were said to have chiselled the obelisk from solid granite in the second century. The work is expected to be carried out before the end of 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obelisk presently stands opposite the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation headquarters in Rome, close to the Colosseum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampala, Uganda (PANA) The management of Uganda Airlines Corporation is not keen on the proposed merger with Alliance Air, whose financial position is said to be enviable, the New Vision newspaper reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Kampala-based government daily newspaper cited a management position paper to the board which said that Alliance Air had lost 18 million U.S.  dollars since it started operations in 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the losses were attributed to use of an expensive aircraft, poor marketing and lavish expenditure by company officials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliance uses Boeing 747 SP on its long haul routes from Johannesburg, South Africa, to Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; Entebbe, Uganda, and London.  Critics says that the airplane which seats some 400 people, owned by South African Airways, has proved expensive on this route and costly to maintain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintenance and fuel costs constitute on average of 60 percent of the costs of a commercial airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Alliance Corporation Secretary Fred Ochieng Obbo denied that the airline had made losses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In fact we are prospering. We have made some money. But of course we are paying off some of the borrowed funds which we initially started with,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The merger has come under stiff resistance, although it is being pushed for by some other quarters. Last week, the Daily News of Tanzania reported that the government in Dar es Salaam deferred endorsement of the proposed merger of Air Tanzania Corporation, Uganda Airlines Corporation and Alliance Air.  The Tanzanian government has referred the merger proposal to the Ministry of Transport for further study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obbo said the proposed three-way merger was made by the governments of Uganda and Tanzania. Ugandan and Tanzanian transport ministers met February 17 in Kampala and resolved that the three airlines merge before privatization.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (PANA) - United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has appealed to the organization's member states to pressure Zairean anti-government leader Laurent Kabila to negotiate a solution to the conflict in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Monday that a negotiated solution to the crisis could only be achieved by a cease-fire and sustained talks on the future of Zaire, Africa's third largest country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is obvious that Zaire is on the verge of a major political change but this change has to be managed, with the support of the international community, in a concerted and focused manner,&quot; Annan said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In such situations, progress is usually made when the entire international community comes together,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan's statement, issued in Rome where he is on a visit, came amid reports that the rebels have begun their advance on Kinshasa, after capturing a sting of major cities and towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that a durable solution to the war could not be achieved through military means. So, he said it was encouraging that President Mobutu Sese Seko had agreed to talks with Kabila.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The stakes are high. If we are successful, Zaire could begin to move in the direction of national reconciliation, democracy and prosperity,&quot; he said.  &quot;If we fail, it will mean misery and stagnation for millions of people in the region.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annan expressed concern that implementation of the five-point U.S. Peace Plan had not begun, in spite of its acceptance of it by the Zairean government and the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan, endorsed by the Security Council, calls for an immediate cease- fire, withdrawal of all foreign troops, including mercenaries, protection of refugees and reaffirmation of respect for national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states in the region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (pana) - Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, Nigeria's internationally renowned &quot;Afro-Beat&quot; musician, has sued the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), claiming 1.1 million U.S. dollars in damages over his arrest and detention last week on drug charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fela and 107 others were arrested by NDLEA officials on April 7, at his Lagos residence and nightclub.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was shown to newsmen two days later in handcuffs at a press conference addressed by the NDLEA chairman Maj.Gen. Musa Bamaiyi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the televised press briefing, Bamaiyi accused Fela of being in possession of an undisclosed quantity of Indian hemp at the time of his arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the agency had plans to prosecute the musician for ignoring a previous warning to lay off the substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fela admits to deriving psychological motivation from the use of Indian hemp, which he calls &quot;natural grass.&quot; He says the substance has medicinal value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a suit filed at a Lagos Federal High Court Monday by his lawyer and friend, Femi Falana, Fela is claiming 100 million naira (about 1.1 million U.  S. dollars) as damages for the arrest and detention, which the lawyer called unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falana also wants the court to declare that the NDLEA lacks competence to charge Fela before the miscellaneous offenses tribunal for possession of Indian hemp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed the musician was &quot;forcefully removed from his residence contrary to medical advice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer is therefore praying the court to order Fela's release to continue his medical treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the application supported by an affidavit deposed by Femi, his musician son, Fela is also requesting the court to order the NDLEA and its agents to vacate his nightclub called the &quot;Afrika Shrine&quot; pending the determination of the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Making a case for his father's release, Femi claimed Fela had never jumped bail, even though he had faced more criminal prosecutions than any other Nigerian, living or dead. No date has been fixed for hearing the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fela had been in and out of detention in the past for charges ranging from murder to public assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was jailed by a military tribunal in 1984 for foreign exchange trafficking under a stringent law enacted by the regime of former military ruler, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year ago, the musician was arrested and detained by NDLEA officials on another drug charge. The agency did not press charges then, but opted instead to counsel Fela with the hope of persuading him to give up Indian hemp.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . ZAIRE - Complex Emergency, Fact Sheet 11, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, April 15, 1997. Note: The last fact sheet was dated April 10, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background: In mid-October 1996, fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 700,000 Rwandans and 62,000 Burundians to repatriate by the end of 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of thousands of refugees also fled west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance gaining territory on all fronts. The Alliance now controls approximately one-third of Zaire. Following the capture of Mubji-Mayi on April 5, the Alliance seized Lubumbashi, Zaire's second largest city, and the copper-mining center of Zaire, on April 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haut-Zaire Province: Approximately 89,500 Rwandan refugees are clustered in three groups along the 125 km rail line west of the Zaire River, south of Kisangani: 57,000 at km 25, 31,000 at km 41, and 2,500 at km 82. Humanitarian agencies have set up therapeutic feeding centers, water sources, medical facilities, and services for unaccompanied children at each site. The United Nations (U.N.) World Health Organization reports 150 cholera cases at km 25.  The cholera strain is not virulent and Medecins Sans Frontieres International (MSF/I) has already begun treating affected refugees in two isolation tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) field officer flew to Ubundu town on April 13 with WFP, MSF/I, and Oxfam and noted that about 100 of the 325 refugees remaining there are in extremely vulnerable condition.  The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plans to move the refugees by train to km 41 once the weak are stabilized. The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) has begun distributing food to Zairians whose food supply has been affected by the foraging of refugees, ex-FAR, and Interahamwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Alliance and the Government of Rwanda insist that air repatriation of the most vulnerable refugees from the Kisangani area cannot begin until the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has completed its airlift of nearly 13,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs). ICRC and UNHCR transported 57 unaccompanied children and 447 IDPs to Goma in the last week. UNHCR has 35 trucks and five small planes ready to transport refugees. The British Overseas Development Agency is establishing an air logistics cell in Goma and a transportation unit in Kisangani, which will control air, road, and river movements for the repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kivu Province: On March 31, UNHCR reported that 20,000 - 30,000 Rwandan refugees emerged at Karuba, 13 km west of Sake. Another 2,500 surfaced at Tongo, west of the former camps of Katale and Kahindo, north of Goma. Once the refugees are screened by Alliance forces, UNHCR trucks them directly to the Rwandan border. From April 1 - 11, 20,817 refugees repatriated from Karuba and Tongo. An additional 15,000 refugees have reportedly emerged in the Masisi region. USAID/DART's Goma field representative traveled to Kindu with ICRC to assess humanitarian needs. Of the 909 IDPs in Kindu, 806 are living with families, and 103 live in an old depot in the center of town. The IDPs and locals are healthy with adequate water sources and sanitation. The most important needs are medical equipment, medicines, and chemical treatment for water stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasai-Oriental Province: At least 30,000 refugees are moving towards Angola.  They are believed to be the group who fled the Shabunda area camps in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Assistance: On March 14, USAID/DART arrived in the region to help advance relief efforts in eastern Zaire. USAID/DART installed an information officer in Nairobi and field officers in Goma and Kisangani.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has seconded two doctors to UNICEF. BHR/OFDA has provided grants to ICRC to assist Zairian IDPs and repatriating Rwandan refugees and to Save the Children/UK for vulnerable Rwandan and Zairian unaccompanied children. The State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration has provided funding to ICRC and to UNHCR for IDPs and refugees in eastern Zaire. Between December and February, BHR's Office of Food for Peace provided roughly 2,500 MT of food to eastern Zaire from the Rwanda Regional Program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - Police investigations into the alleged fraudulent license issued to Parliament's deputy speaker, Baleke Mbete Kgositsile, in Mpumalanga are expected to expose widespread corruption in the traffic departments of the three former homelands which make up the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile is one of 44 people, most from KwaZulu Natal, who are currently being investigated by the Nelspruit Fraud Unit for possessing fake temporary licenses supposedly issued at the Kabokweni Test Centre in KaNgwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although police continued to refuse to comment on their &quot;highly sensitive&quot; investigation on Monday, sources within the province's Safety &amp; Security Department told African Eye News Service (South Africa) that the investigation was expected to reveal well organised syndicates which used former homeland traffic officers and government officials to issue &quot;legal&quot; driver licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these officials are reportedly now senior provincial administrators and test centre heads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile insists that she was legally tested for her license at the Delmas test centre in Mpumalanga on October 1 last year, after the provincial Safety &amp; Security MEC, Steve Mabona, specially organised the test for her &quot;to save me from standing in queues, as I am a very busy person with children scattered all over the country, a job in Cape Town and a constituency in KwaZulu&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile said in a press release on Monday that she welcomed any police investigation into illegal licenses but insisted that to the best of her knowledge the temporary license issued to her was a legal document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She supplied the press with copies of her ID and the temporary license to the press but refered all further queries to MEC Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona, who says that he sent his own vehicle and bodyguards to fetch Kgositsile for the test from Johannesburg on October 1, insisted that it was not irregular that there were no official records of either Kgositsile's test or temporary license at the centre where she was supposedly tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also insisted that it was not irregular or illegal that the license currently being used by Kgositsile was actually issued 350km away from Delmas, at Kabokweni, and without the knowledge of Kabokweni staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Kgositsile and Mabona say that the test at Delmas was personally conducted by provincial traffic head, Director Henry Brazer, but Brazer repeatedly refused to discuss the issue for fear of &quot;incriminating myself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Insisting that the media coverage of the investigation was a deliberate smear campaign by African Eye News Service (South Africa) investigative reporters, Mabona said in a press statement on Monday night that &quot;the report was made by a ignorant reporter who has never served in the Government administration or any other administration&quot; (sic).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dismissing initial reports on Sunday as a distortion of the facts aimed at embarrassing Kgositsile, Mabona added that reporters writing on the issue &quot; lack objectivity and impartiality .. and have alternative motives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As political head, I would like to state that I am satisfied and convinced that the license issued to Kgositsile was legal,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona also alleged in his statement that details about the investigation had been leaked to the press by principal traffic officer, John Muller, who was &quot;a biased official against whom the department has taken action because of his failure to report for work, ... his racism and insubordination&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Denying that his department had ever halted an internal investigation into the allegations against Kgositsile last year, Mabona said that neither he nor his departmental head had even received an official complaint about the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona did, however, acknowledge that a request was forwarded to department head, Advocate Stanley Soko, for an inspection of the 'master' license books at Kabokweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Muller) is a mere principle (sic) traffic officer who does not have any authority and competency to demand the books from other offices. Such books can only be obtained by the Head Office through proper channels and protocol,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department head issued instructions that no books should be given to him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Muller played a key role in earlier investigations which led to the arrest of 11 government officials for selling licenses to the public and also brought the government's attention to the fact that Director Brazer had admitted to irregularly using State funds to go on holiday with his family to the USA, Adv Soko decided not to follow up on Muller's allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, I did quiz Brazer verbally about the charges but was satisfied with his explanation,&quot; explained Soko. He admitted that he did not bother to check Brazer's explanation with either the Delmas or Kabokweni test centre heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charging that Muller had failed to turn up at work for 24-months but had insisted on being paid, Mabona repeatedly labelled Muller a racist in his press statement, who had &quot;run to the opposition to exert pressure to get his salary and who was engaged in a vendetta against the department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabona's press release, however, failed to address the fact that there are no official records of the license at Delmas, that the license was issued contrary to national regulations, outside the magisterial district of Delmas, in Kabokweni without the knowledge of staff there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also fails to explain why initial complaints of fraud involving prominent politicians, whether formal or not, were not followed up on or reported to the police by his department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller declined to comment on the issue, saying that he awaited the results of the police investigation and that he had refered the allegations of racism to his attorney.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THOHOYANDOU - Police have launched an inquest into the death of a 26-year- old woman who died after a self-proclaimed prophet from the Golgotha Zion Apostolic Church in Northern Province allegedly overdosed her with traditional medicine to cure her of bad luck, at Tshilungoma II near Thoyandou on the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virginia Muthelo died from severe diarrhea which fatally dehydrated her over an 18-hour period, leading to total kidney failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was given the 'cleansing' herbal medicine by the 44-year-old prophet to clean what he called her &quot;filthy intestines&quot; after complaining of two years of bad luck.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses report that almost immediately after drinking the liquid herbal brew, Muthelo &quot;lost energy, rushed to a outhouse toilet and stayed there for hours before dying on the toilet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Five other elderly people also drunk the medicine, but only Virginia died.  We are therefore confused, because she was the youngest and therefore supposedly the strongest,&quot; said police spokesperson, Captain Ailwei Mushavhanamadi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was uncertain, he added, whether all five people drank the same kind of medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pint-sized prophet remained adamant on Tuesday that his medicine could not have killed Muthelo but that &quot;the extreme coldness she must have experienced in the outhouse toilet&quot; was probably responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told police that he had been treating patients for at least five years, insisting that no one died before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's bullshit! My daughter was strong and healthy, I do not believe that she died of coldness,&quot; France Muthelo (52), the deceased's father told African Eye News Service (South Africa).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My daughter had been looking for help to rid of her bad luck two years.  Just when she thought she had found a solution, it killed her.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to investigating officer, Detective-Sergeant Mpfariseni Ligunuba, the prophet is expected to bring his medicine to the police station on Wednesday to be tested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are waiting for the postmortem results before the prophet can be detained as a suspect.&quot; Said Sergeant Ligunuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other people who also received treatment from the prophet include Virginia's mother, Tshinakaho Muthelo (49), Johannes Makatu (66) and three other elderly people.  (South Africa)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - A 33-year-old game ranger from the Kruger National Park was acquitted of murder by the Nelspruit Circuit of the Supreme Court, after the State failed to prove that he purposely gunned down two of his colleagues while they watched television last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freddy Mashele was arrested after the two men, Ephriam Mavundla and Thembani Mashaba, were repeatedly shot in the chest with an R1 rifle while they were relaxing at the private Nwanetsi Camp in the Kruger National Park on February 29, 1996.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court found that while Mashele had pleaded guilty to shooting the men, the State had been unable to prove that he had consciously planned or intended to shoot them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that Mashele had been very drunk at the time of the incident and the witnesses admitted that he'd not been &quot;consciously&quot; in control of his actions, the court ruled that he could therefore not be found liable for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution had alleged that Mashele confronted his two fellow rangers in the camp's staff recreation quarters after an earlier argument and shot them with his R1 service rifle before they could defend themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavundla died immediately after the metal tipped sharp point R1 bullets hit his heart and lungs. A medical report submitted to court said that the bullets completely shredded his heart and left-hand lung.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mashaba survived the initial shot but died while being rushed to a clinic at the Kruger Park's Setara Camp. A medical report said that Mashaba died of massive internal shock and a complete collapse of his blood circulation system after R1 bullets hit him in the abdominal aorta vein.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No arrests were made and no injuries were reported, but the campus remains tense with both the South African Students Congress and the Pan-Africanist Students Organisation accusing the SRC of betraying student's interests by collaborating with campus management.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SRC president and Azanian Student's Congress member, Mbongiseni Ndlela convened the meeting to report that the SRC had managed to register a record number of students at the university for the 1997 academic year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied allegations of collusion with campus management, however, with regards to the new fee structure system, whereby students are charged for every subject they take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also separate accommodation, catering and material fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When students from opposing organisations began screaming for the SRC's unbanding and for new elections, Ndlela attempted to close the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, angry students jumped onto the stage and began beating SRC members, while small scuffles also broke out in the crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police, who had been monitoring the meeting, fired one tear-gas canister to disperse the students.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The R655-million budget for Mpumalanga's finance and corporate services department for the 1997/ 98 fiscal year is double that of last year's budget, announced provincial finance MEC Jacques Modipane on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unprecedented increase is as a result of the centralisation of provincial government functions in the department and the transfer of various administrative support functions from other departments into the finance department, Modipane told the provincial legislature during his 1997 policy speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most important objectives of his department, however, remains the eradication of inefficiency and corruption, with the adoption of a harder line policy for prosecuting frauds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conceding that the past year had been &quot;challenging&quot; to his department, with a move to partially completed buildings seriously hampering the department's ability to provide effective services, Modipane stressed his success in increasing provincial earnings from own revenues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These revenues, which cannot be reclaimed by central government, at least matched the inflation rate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although this may not appear to be all that significant, it must be noted that certain programmes will only bear fruit two to three years down the line, &quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These programmes are notably those affecting the collection of fees, such as licensing fees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modipane also announced that in light of previous financial control problems experienced by Mpumalanga, it had become inevitable to appoint internal audit committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant infrastructure improvement made during the past year, he said , is the replacement of old computer systems with a more efficient and compatible system, which has already enabled the department to ensure that its expenditure reports for management monitoring had been produced timeously since September last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest chunk of the 1997/ 98 budget, R468-million, was allocated to the Provincial Treasury, while R15-million will be spent on administration and salaries, R15-million on financial management and R89-million on the construction of government buildings and other structures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount reserved for new buildings includes the initial phases of the new provincial government complex and legislature in Nelspruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional R65,6-million will be allocated to the various development agencies in Mpumalanga, including the Mpumalanga Finance Corporation and the discredited Mpumalanga Development Corporation.  (South Africa)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Amnesty Committee of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission has granted amnesty to another eight applicants, including members or supporters of the African National Congress, the United Democratic Front, the End Conscription Campaign and the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The applicants all applied for amnesty in respect of offences which do not fall within the definition of a gross violation of human rights, as laid down in the law governing the operations of the commission. As a result no public hearings were necessary and the Committee took its decisions in chambers.  (The law defines killing, abduction, torture and severe ill-treatment as gross violations).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following are the details:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Abel Bhila</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abel Bhila, 29, who describes himself as a member/or supporter of the African National Congress and Umkhonto weSizwe, was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for unlawful possession of firearms and/or handgrenades. He said in his application he was found in possession of a handgrenade in a bag he was carrying in central Johannesburg on March 24, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Saul Barrie Batzofin</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saul Batzofin, 27, a member of the End Conscription Campaign, was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in 1989 for refusing to serve in the former South African Defence Force. He has completed his sentence but told the Commission that he wanted to apply for amnesty to clear his criminal record. He said although he was proud to have been a conscientious objector, the record caused difficulties with visa applications for foreign countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Reginald Jameson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reginald Jameson, 38, who described himself as a UDF supporter, also applied for amnesty in respect of a sentence which he has already served. He told the Committee he was jailed for a year on arson and public violence charges after student unrest in June 1976. He said he had taken part an arson attempt at Modderdam High School, Bonteheuwel, in the expectation of a new, better school being built.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Mncedisi Mzolisi Klaas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mncedisi Klaas, 27, an ANC Youth League organiser, applied for amnesty in respect of charges of robbery, malicious damage to property and sabotage. He told the Committee that the offences were committed during the course of a conflict over services between township residents and the local authorities in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth, in 1992. He said the vehicles which were the subject of the robbery and damage to property charges were targeted because they were government vehicles. The sabotage charge arose out of damage to electricity lines and the sub-stations. He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Duke Wellington Moilwanyane</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duke Moilwanyane, 24, who described himself as a ANC supporter, was convicted on charges of public violence and malicious damage to property after a confrontation with police at Ikageng, Potchefstroom, on March 24, 1993. He said he was among protest marchers who clashed with police at the entrance to Ikageng as they attempted to march to the office of the former Department of Education and Training in Potchefstroom. He was jailed for four years on the public violence charge and 2 years on the charge of damaging property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Alison Motsopi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alison Motsopi, 27, described himself as a member of ANC Youth League. He told the Committee he had possessed handgrenades in Vosloorus on the East Rand in 1992. He said his actions should be viewed against the background of conflict with the IFP in the region at the time. He said in his amnesty application that although the charges had been withdrawn at the time, police had later re-opened the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Kevin John Trytsman</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kevin Trytsman, 28, of Sandton, was granted amnesty in respect of charges of illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, vehicle theft and perjury.  He said in his amnesty application that he was found in possession of an AK- 47 rifle, two magazines and a car on a farm he was renting near Knoppieslaagte. Trytsman was given a suspended sentence for possession of the firearm, a fine for the possession of the magazines and a five-year jail sentence for vehicle theft. He told the Committee he had given the court false explanations for possessing the material -- in fact he had been storing them on behalf of Umkhonto weSizwe. Mr Trytsman was sentenced in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motivating his application relating to the perjury charge, Mr Trytsman said that while awaiting trial on the other charges, he had been approached by one Ferdi Barnard and one Eugene Reilly regarding information about his MK commander. He had &quot;to a certain extent&quot; become friendly with Barnard and Reilly. Barnard had bragged to him that he had shot Dr David Webster and that Reilly had been driving him at the time. Mr Trytsman said he was called to give evidence at the inquest into Dr Webster's death but had failed to tell the inquest of Mr Barnard's statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Albertus Francois van der Merwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albertus van der Merwe, 58, who describes himself as an AWB member, was jailed in 1994 for eight years on charges of sabotage and the transport or storage of explosives. He told the Committee he was a member of the explosives unit of the AWB's special task force which was responsible for explosions during November and December 1993 at a government weighbridge in the Krugersdorp district, at an electrical sub-station at Munsieville, Krugersdorp, and at the shop of a suspected ANC supporter at Burgershoop, Krugersdorp. He had also been involved in attempting to cause an explosion at a sub-station near the Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - the narrow margin in the value of dollar between banks and the black market is an indicative of the fact that Ethiopia's economy is displaying health progress, a senior government official in the Office of the Prime Minister has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Fantaye Biftu, head of the trade and finance supervision bureau in the office with the rank of a minister, said it is illegal to exchange dollar outside banks and added that the illegal exchange of dollar is of no benefit as the margin between the value at banks and the black market has already narrowed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As some offices are privileged to get foreign exchanges and travellers are entitled to earn foreign currencies at commercial banks, the black market would soon die its natural death, Ato Fantaye said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the prevalent economic order has enabled importers to earn foreign exchanges at the weekly auction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head said the country's foreign exchange reserve which had been a serious threat previously, has now reached the level it could meet the demand of bidders at the auction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Fantaye said the trial to earn foreign exchanges could possible entail loss by amassing fake notes, adding that exporters are now privileged to open an account in foreign exchanges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the head, the reserve requirement for private banks is 5 percent where as it is 8 per cent for government banks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York - Text of a letter from William A. Orme, Jr., executive director, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), to President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone, April 15, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) writes to express its concern about the amendment to the existing press law that was introduced in Parliament this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the proposed changes are requirements that all editors have ten years prior experience in journalism, five of them in an editorial capacity. All journalists will be required to have an educational degree in their field and will receive their certification from the police; to our knowledge, the first instance in the region where police have been granted the authority to certify journalists. In addition, all newspapers which began circulation after February 1996 will be required to re-register. These requirements will effectively dissolve 30 of the country's 42 newspapers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a nonpartisan group of journalists dedicated to the promotion of press freedom worldwide, CPJ takes strong issue over the proposed amendments for their potential to cripple the burgeoning press in Sierra Leone. The proposed amendment is particularly disturbing because it will effectively censor 75% of the country's newspapers and deny most journalists of their right to hold and express opinions and ideas. These rights are guaranteed by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees the right to &quot;seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kind,&quot; and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, to which we respectfully remind Your Excellency, Sierra Leone is a signatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Your Excellency, we strongly urge you to challenge the proposed amendment to the press laws and guarantee the protection of the media's right to practice its profession freely and safely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thank you for your attention. We welcome your comments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - 1. UNIP IN-FIGHTING INCREASES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrangling in UNIP, the former ruling political party continues with more members demanding that its leader, Kenneth Kaunda, steps aside for a younger generation .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest attack on Kaunda's leadership has come from Sam Moyo, a member of UNIP's central committee. Moyo, a vocal youth leader and once a die-hard supporter of Kaunda, now accuses him of misleading the party and demands that a national party congress be held to replace the current leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the party central committee reacted by expelling Moyo and two other vocal members - former party general secretary Benjamin Mibenge and Arnold Chooka, former advisor to Kaunda. Chooka has said there are several other members of the UNIP central committee who would want the Kaunda-led central committee to step down but fear being expelled from the party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A veteran party member, Lavu Mulimba, has resigned from politics after being appointed a member of Zambia's Human Rights Commission. Mulimba, who served in various cabinet posts under Kaunda, says he could no longer continue in active politics as he would now rather concentrate on his non- partisan role of being a Human Rights commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. VETERAN POLITICIAN DISMISSES PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS RUMOURS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling MMD national secretary, Michael Sata, has dismissed growing speculation that he aspires to the presidency in 2001. However, some political observers don't believe his apparent non-interest in the post. Sata also says accusations that he has been holding secret campaign meetings were unfounded. He is among four key MMD figures generally regarded as likely contenders for the party presidency after President Chiluba completes his second and final term of office in 2001. Others are Defence Minister Ben Mwila, Finance Minister Ronald Penza and Vice-President Godfrey Miyanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers note that Sata is on record as once having said that there was nothing wrong with being ambitious, in response to a query as to whether he aspired to be president of Zambia. He is also remembered for his 1991 MMD campaign statement in which he stated that he had no ambitions of being a minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To date, he has held several ministerial positions and is now minister without portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. ZAMBIA DEPLOYS CRACK TROOPS ON BORDER WITH WAR-TORN ZAIRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia has deployed commandos, its crack unit of soldiers, on the border with war-torn Zaire. This follows the arrest of armed Zairian and Burundese soldiers inside the country. Most of the commandos are stationed on the long border stretch of the Copperbelt Province which borders Zaire's Shaba Province whose capital Lubumbashi fell to rebel leader Laurent Kabila's forces last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With towns bordering Zambia also having fallen into rebel hands, a steady stream of refugees have been entering Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A. JOURNALISTS REJECT PROPOSED MEDIA COUNCIL BILL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian journalists have rejected a proposed Media Council Bill, drafted by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, describing it as a government attempt to suppress freedom of expression. All news media organisations in the country - the Press Association of Zambia, the Zambia Independent Media Association, The Media Women Association of Zambia, The Commonwealth Press Union and the Zambia Union of Journalists - have rejected the bill. The Law Association of Zambia has also condemned the bill in its present form saying that if passed into law, free flow of information would be restricted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Information Minister David Mpamba says that the bill would not be passed into law without consensus with other stakeholders. He said the bill, drafted by his ministry, would be circulated widely for further proposals before being taken to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.B. ....AND MARCH IN PROTEST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of journalists took part in a protest march in Lusaka to protest the proposed enactment of the Media Council bill . The 5km march from Lusaka's commercial centre ended at the Lusaka High Court where representatives of the various news media organisations spelt out their rejection of the bill. The march was characterised by chants denouncing the bill as a piece of legislation that was aimed at curtailing freedom of speech and information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protest against the bill has brought journalists from both the private and the state-owned media out in an unprecedented united front. The journalists have also engaged lawyers to fight the bill in court and intend to raise the issue with the recently formed Human Rights Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although government says it is still open to discussion on the bill, journalists say that they do not need a media council in any form. They are particularly angered that government should be proposing journalists have a license to practice their profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar march planned for Kitwe, Zambia second city, fell through because the police refused to grant the journalists based in the town a permit to carry out their protest. Another solidarity march was planned for the Namibian capital, Windhoek ,where journalists were to picket the Zambian High Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The journalists are concerned that despite the vehement protest, government could still present the bill in the MMD-dominated parliament and pass it into law. Spokesman for the journalists, Robby Makai , said journalists were aware of such a possibility and they were working on counter measures. Last year, parliament passed a Land Bill despite it being roundly rejected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. CHILUBA INTERVENES IN STREET-VENDING DISPUTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has taken the direct intervention of President Chiluba to diffuse mounting tension in Lusaka between street vendors and local authorities who have been trying to get them off the main roads of the city's commercial centre. The vendors have refused to move off the roads demanding that they be given appropriate selling points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vendors, who trade in goods ranging from groceries and toys to clothes, footwear and hardware, have forced some legitimate traders to close their shops because they (vendors) are setting their mini-shops in front of the established ones. The Government is banking on a major market that is being constructed to take all or most of the street vendors off the streets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. BANK CLOSURE QUANDARY FOR FARMERS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE closure of Lima Bank, has thrown the business operations of peasant farmers into a quandary because of the difficulties now of obtaining loans at affordable rates. The bank, which has been put under receivership, was the only remaining formidable lending institution from which peasant farmers could get loans for buying of their necessities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bank had been in recent years, however, hit by financial problems caused mostly by failure to recover its loans from the farmers. In 1995, the Co-operative Bank, another lending institution established primarily to assist farmers, closed because of financial problems. The farmers will now have to get their loans, at high risk and higher interest, from commercial banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. BANK OF ZAMBIA WARNS AGAINST FAKE BANK NOTES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fake bank notes are in circulation in Zambia, and the Bank of Zambia has warned people to be on the look out . A spokesman for the central bank said the fake notes were virtually the same as genuine ones in appearance but some security features were missing. The fake notes detected are in the K10,000 denomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have also warned residents against tricksters who are cutting K10, 000 and K1,000 notes into half and gluing the different halves together, then presenting the mutilated note as a K10,000. This was detected in Lusaka where an alert shop keeper noticed that one half of the note given to him was K1, 000 and the other half was K10,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. ZAMBIAN SOCCER FANS DEMAND SACKING OF COACHES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Zambia was held to a 2-2 draw by Zaire in a World Cup qualifying match, Zambian soccer fans are now demanding that the coach Fred Mwila and the technical advisor Samuel Ndhlovu be fired. Some fans pelted the coaches with cans and bottles during the match played in Zimbabwe and others threatened to beat the coaches after the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result of the match drastically reduced Zambia's hopes of qualifying for the World Cup finals set for France next year. Zambia and Zaire have only two points each after three games played while Congo top the group with seven points and followed by South Africa on four points. The winner of the group will qualify for the World Cup finals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - When the University of Zambia was prematurely closed last month, many Zambians were not surprised. The closure of Zambia's highest institution of learning was in fact expected especially when acts of violence had broken out at the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many Zambians were also disgusted, disappointed and concerned that the institution seemed unable to find a permanent solution to the now frequent premature closures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In recent years, the frequency of such closures has increased and on virtually all occasions the reason has been &quot;to stem an escalation of violence&quot;. When the closures have taken place, students, especially the student union leaders, have either been suspended or expelled. This has allegedly been due to them being regarded as the ring-leaders who incite other students to violence. The closures have not, however, stemmed the rebellious or combative attitude of some students. The atmosphere at the university remains tense.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The university council, the institution's governing body, admits that the closures are too frequent and also admits that it has been unable to find a permanent solution to the problem. Because of this, the university has set up a special committee to &quot;find a lasting solution&quot;. The special committee has been given the task of collecting written and oral public submissions and to find a solution from this information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the key tasks of the committee, which comprises a broad representation of notable public figures, is to investigate and make recommendations on the possibility of re-opening the university as soon as possible. The committee is also to establish causes of student violence and to explore ways of preventing and controlling it. Another priority task is to make recommendations on the present system of financing government sponsored students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Beston Ng'onga, an economist and former student, feels the cause for the current spate of student violence is money, or rather the lack of it. He notes that in the early years of the institution, student unrest was over national issues and not over the monetary package to which each student was entitled. Ng'onga notes that every student at the institution in the 60s, 70s and the early parts of the 80s, was well funded and did not have to worry about tuition fees, book and meal allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Students in those days never boycotted classes over a poor diet or inadequate allowances. It was always over serious issues, like when they protested over Britain's alleged support for the rebel government of Ian Smith in the then Rhodesia (Zimbabwe),&quot; Ng'onga contends. He also sites the example of a protest match in the mid 70s when the students showed their solidarity for the MPLA, then still a liberation movement in Angola, while the Zambian government backed the UNITA movement. Even then, however, students resorted to violence, often clashing with police which would then often lead to the institution being closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elias Mpondela agrees. He is another former student and noted that money was never an issue among students until government decided to start giving each government-sponsored student his or her sponsorship dues, which included meal allowances, book allowances and tuition fees. Previously, the government gave such sponsorship dues directly to the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the system of financing to which some concerned observers would like government to revert, saying that it worked well before the decision to give the students cash, and that it was still working well in other higher institutions of learning in Zambia. A former minister in both the previous and the current government, Andrew Kashita, suggests that the money should be given directly to the institution which would then facilitate the student's needs, including meals and books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The argument is that most students are irresponsible and use the money for other purposes like beer drinking, which contributes to their vicious approach to issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suggestion that students stop getting meal allowances and instead receive meal cards entitling them to eat from the institutions dining halls, has its own demerits. There has been a drastic reduction of students who buy their meals from the university dining halls and because of this only one of the four dining halls remains operational. Most students cook in their own rooms, despite a ban on this. Ng'onga notes that the food must at all times be of high quality because, as was the case in the past, bad food becomes a cause for student riots. &quot;If the food is poorly prepared, you cannot expect the students to just sit back. They would not only boycott the food but also vent their anger on anyone or anything they can lay their hands on,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the immaturity of students, Mpondela, who is now a Lusaka business executive, said that it was too much to expect mature behaviour from youngsters of 17-year, the average age for university entrance in Zambia. &quot; Boys and girls straight from school are generally excited about life and are by nature militant. There is not much you can do about such militancy but there is a lot you can do to keep it in check.&quot; He added that although there is a high measure of militancy amongst the students, it is not all of them who respond with violence whenever there is an issue about which they wish to express displeasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In 1982 we, the then small Catholic community at the university, rose against our students' union leadership who had been planning a more radical way of protesting, and this proved successful,&quot; Mpondela reflects. He says that now the Christian community at the university is even stronger and that this could help chart a more peaceful approach to issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, recent student violence at the university points to violence escalating if students try to keep check on each other. Shortly before last November's presidential and parliamentary elections, the university was closed after some students opposed to the new constitution, beat up some of their fellow students who supported the constitution. Some of the anti- constitution students burnt books and other property of the pro-constitution students and forced them to flee the campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But one student, Selisho Walubita, says that it is a misconception to believe that the current crop of students is more violent than those before them. He says that there are only a few violent students in the community and it is on these students the administration must concentrate. &quot;We are over 4, 000 in this institution, and so, if even just a quarter of the student population was violent, can you imagine what sort of damage could be caused?.&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a divergence of views is what the special committee is expected to piece together to come up with one lasting solution. Whether or not this will be possible, only time can tell.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - There is an urgent need to restore confidence in Namibia's legal system, the Attorney-General's office said in a report tabled before Parliament yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The backlog that was built up in magistrates and regional courts in the finalisation of cases, especially in Windhoek, is a major concern for the Office of the Prosecutor-General,&quot; stated the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attorney General Vekuii Rukoro said in the document that the need for more competent public prosecutors was becoming increasingly urgent. He also observed that &quot;it is not possible to increase productivity and efficiency without competent manpower and equipment&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many magistrates' offices, including the Regional Court in Windhoek, are equipped with outdated or insufficient equipment and law books,&quot; the report said. It cited the example of the Regional Court in Windhoek which does not even have a photocopier, while accused persons needed copies of the contents of case dockets to prepare for their trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters were made worse by the fact that Rukoro's Office had operated on a limited budget for the past two years and had not been in a position to deal with its ever-increasing workload. &quot;The result is that the Office of the Prosecutor-General is increasingly losing the battle against crime, and a much more concerted effort will be needed to restore some control and efficiency,&quot; the report stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the constraints facing this office is that senior lawyers, with ranks equivalent to under-secretaries, did not have secretaries, resulting in one private secretary serving seven lawyers. Rukoro's personal assistant and his private secretary were assisting in typing lawyers' work, and the resulting workload could only be addressed by putting in after-hours work. On anti-corruption measures, Rukoro stated: &quot;Without analysing the details of each case, it can be said generally that the Government's response has not always met desired standards of transparency and accountability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report further said that in some cases, the media and the public were left with the impression that Government either sought to cover up wrongdoing or was not diligent in its efforts to address the problem. The report, however, added that there was a belief among some circles of the community and the press that Africans were generally corrupt, and as Namibia was an African country, there had to be some corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such a perception is equally harmful to the nation and grossly unfair to Government and therefore needs to be corrected through a process of education of the public,&quot; stated the report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The disturbing number of suicides in the north of Namibia, which have spiralled dramatically over the past few years, is showing no sign of dropping off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Already this year at least 44 people have taken their own lives, indicating that the trend is set to continue. Since 1994 there has been an acceleration in the number of people killing themselves in the northern regions, usually by hanging or shooting themselves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibian reported on April 11 last year that 42 people in the North had committed suicide, compared to 26 during the same period in 1995. According to Police reports in Oshakati, the number of people committing suicide has shot from 45 people during 1994, to 100 in 1995 and 165 last year, 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unemployment, loneliness, diseases, poverty, unwanted pregnancies, failure at schools, the loss of important family members are being seen as some of the main reasons why people are taking their own lives. As the spate of suicides has increased, an investigation was launched into the reasons among communities in the North, and it is hoped that the findings of the probe will shed further light on the worrying trend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chief of the Ministry of Health's Social Services division in Oshakati told The Namibian that they had completed their investigation and that the findings would be made public soon.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Interim profit figures at retail group New Clicks Holdings indicate that the group is set for another good year, says Clicks chief executive Trevor Honeysett.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Net profits of R38,8 million were boosted by &quot;exceptional&quot; performances from Diskom and Musica, a sharp increase in existing store sales, and new store openings in each of the group's core businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Honeysett said that all three of the three trading brands - Clicks, Diskom and Musica - still had huge upside growth potential.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the six months to February, sales at Clicks rose by 15,6 percent, at Diskom by 31,2 percent and at Musica by 33,8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As we work these businesses more and more under the technology microscope we are finding out a lot about the consumers, their preferences and their trading habits,&quot; Mr Honeysett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the way in the field of technology had been the phenomenal success of the Clicks ClubCard, a loyalty card which gives customers points for every rand that they spend. The points are redeemed for discounts on later purchases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Honeysett said there were now 1,25 million ClubCard holders who accounted for more than 50 percent of sales at Clicks stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believed the ClubCard offered a unique opportunity for cross pollination within the group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Clicks Clubcard customer and the Musica customer are more often than not the same customer, so we are now starting to explore the possibility of extending the Musica offers to Clicks ClubCard holders to add more value to the ClubCard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are starting to explore running marketing and merchandise programmes driven fundamentally through Musica stores as ClubCard offers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the other benefits of the ClubCard as a direct marketing tool were yet to flow through, Mr Honeysett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that during the Christmas season, Tesco, a UK retailer and one of the first to use the ClubCard loyalty concept, had for the first time not used any television advertising to promote sales at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All their Christmas advertising was directed through the database.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What begins to happen with loyalty schemes is that you start to reposition your marketing expenditure more and more into the area of direct marketing,&quot; Mr Honeysett said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Financial director Peter Green said technology was also bringing changes when it came to making decisions about buying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This had resulted in changes to the product mix in stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But specifically for underperforming stores, it allows us to remove certain products from the range to get the investment in stock down and so improve the store's performance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Green said the roll-out of scanning technology had been completed at Clicks and he expected to have the whole of Musica converted to scanning technology by the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diskom would &quot;probably&quot; have between 30 and 40 of its stores using scanning technology by the year end, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Honeysett said the ClubCard concept would not be used at Diskom stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen substantial growth in the sale of Christmas stamps at Diskom.  That's the type of loyalty vehicle that that segment of the market understands best.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - One play Mavis Taylor will never forget is Bernard Shaw's Saint Joan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As we sit in the lounge of her Tamboerskloof home, the charmingly eccentric Mavis tells me why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My life as an only child was one of constant loneliness,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After her parents had immigrated from England, her headmaster father moved from town to town every three years so that she was &quot;never able to make friends and keep them&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was while Mavis' family was living in Mooi River in Natal that she became friends with Valentine Waddington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Waddington family (there were seven children) was a very Victorian family, where nobody was allowed to the main table except the adults. We used to make up plays or rather they (the Waddington children) used to make up plays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They were always the prince, the princess, the king, the queen and I was always the funny chamberlain, or the clown - parts they didn't want to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was a little country bumpkin who found it difficult to adjust to sophisticated city life when I attended Durban Girls College.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Add to this considerable problems in her family life and the young Mavis became more and more introverted until she was &quot;not speaking to anybody and was totally shut off from the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the suggestion of a friend, her parents sent her to elocution classes but her teacher, Elizabeth Sneddon, was forced to confess: &quot;I can't do anything with this child.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then, Sneddon decided to put Mavis in a play - Shaw's Saint Joan - and that was when things began to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I played the part of the Dauphin, which is a comedy part, and I was the wow of the evening (I think I inherited this dry sense of humour from my father). I was shy and couldn't speak to people but here was something at last I felt I could do.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, when her father was headmaster in Umzinto, Mavis would &quot;wander around the school house and stroll into the back of the class&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although she wasn't yet of school-going age, (she was 4 or 5) she started to learn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I turned 6 and was due to go into Sub A, I was just beyond this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They put me into Sub B but I was ahead of that too so they put me in Standard 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So I was 6 years old in Standard 1, which was not a great thing emotionally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process continued so that she was emotionally always &quot;too young to deal with the class she was in&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She's been described as &quot;a fighter&quot;. Is that so?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Oh yes. I'm still a fighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I love to fight ... even when I went to university, I was still shy, but if there was an injustice, and this I think comes from my father, I would get in there and fight against that injustice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavis' father, Frank Taylor, was a man who &quot;would never hear anything from anyone that was of a racist nature&quot;. He died when Mavis was 15, &quot;so I didn't have any contact with him as an adult&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bound Apart, her play that is now being performed at the Baxter, deals with inter-racial division and the need to communicate in a post-apartheid South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavis says she &quot;despises liberals, as do most black people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hate the liberal standpoint, it's dishonest. The liberal mind is somebody who says 'Ag shame!' - and then underpays their maid and spends R25 000 to be with Mrs Clinton or whoever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, what would she call herself?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't call myself anything. I'd call myself a person (with a laugh).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Mavis: &quot;The only way ahead for the theatre is to deal with the issues, to engage on the personal, public and social levels. If we do that we'll have a future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've tried to expand on that in Bound Apart. The major challenge is for people to communicate, talk to each other, understand each other's cultures, accept each other's cultures as valid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is South Africa and we have to mix here, otherwise we might as well go and live on our islands - English speakers on one, Afrikaners on another, Xhosas, Tswanas and so on on others. We can't live in a country that is a mixed masala without actually mixing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mavis emphasises that her plays are not &quot;two-dimensional entertainment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Challenge is what it's about and I'm also challenging all kinds of values in this piece.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Mavis runs the New Africa Theatre Project, which trains young people to use performing arts as a means of communication. Bound Apart runs until Saturday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Urgent laws and proper maps are needed to save South Africa's 1999 national elections from failure, the Electoral Steering Committee has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It asked Parliament yesterday to pass a series of laws - many not yet drafted. &quot;Time has become critical to the success of the 1999 elections,&quot; the steering committee warned.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it says new laws are not enough. Unless a sophisticated mapping process is in place by the end of the year, a new barcode scanning system to match identity books with the voters' roll will be useless in the 1999 poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system could save taxpayers about R25-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These dire warnings were issued at a briefing by the committee to the National Assembly committee on home affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The steering committee is an interim precursor to the yet-to-be-appointed Electoral Commission, itself a vital cog in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A shortlist of commission candidates is to be announced this weekend and interviews of aspirant commissioners are due to be held in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frederik van Zyl Slabbert said at a meeting of the steering committee: &quot;We have extremely little time to achieve what we have to to have effective elections in 1999.&quot; Johann Kriegler, who headed the Independent Electoral Commission in 1994 and serves on the steering committee, called for &quot;a change in dimensional thinking&quot; so that people could appreciate the scale of what would have to be achieved in 1999.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was estimated that about 25 million people would go to the polls at 10 000 voting stations, a third of which would not have electricity and a fifth of which would not have telephones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The home affairs committee was reminded that pre-1994 elections involved fewer than three-million voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most significant difference between the 1999 elections and the 1994 poll is that the next elections will be based on voters' rolls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New laws needed included a wholly new Electoral Act, a decision on the number of seats for each provincial legislature, and on the number of seats for the National Assembly, all of which had to be passed between June 1998 and the end of next year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Tiger Woods broke a string of records when he won the United States Masters Golf Championship on Sunday. His victory, however, was more than just another sporting achievement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tiger Woods became part of a rich sporting history on Sunday when he won the United States Masters. He was the youngest winner, his score was the lowest ever and his winning margin the widest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his victory goes well beyond the mere statistics of golf. It touches the social fabric of America and even reaches across to South Africa where the Woods win holds important lessons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Augusta Country Club in Georgia where Woods won the title was, not so long ago, a stronghold of American apartheid. Black players were allowed access only in 1975 and the new champion is only the fourth black player to be invited to the Masters. For us, the story is still all too familiar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Americans may have a head start on us, but they are still struggling to come to terms with race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week, by coincidence, is also the anniversary of Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Fifty years ago on this very day, Robinson, a black man from New York, broke the colour bar in US baseball. Today he is regarded as one of the most significant racial figures in American history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Americans see Woods in a similar way. Professional basketball and gridiron football may be dominated by African-Americans and baseball's Major League made up of 40% black and Hispanic players, but barriers remain. As we report in our sports pages today, black American football coaches believe they are getting a raw deal, and have evidence to support their claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, there is a widespread feeling that sports teams are too slow in reflecting the true make-up of the nation. Tiger Woods's triumph is an example to us as well as a reminder that talent knows no colour.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A huge upheaval is about to begin for about 30 000 municipal staff facing job moves, as the city embraces the post-apartheid era and reorganises itself into new municipalities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unbundling of the 19 old administrations involves the vast logistical process of matching each staff member to a post in the six new municipalities and the Cape Metropolitan Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For thousands of workers this means they will soon be reporting to new bosses and, in many instances, working in different places. The most seriously affected areas will be the core administrations, which will have to split up or merge to serve the new municipalities. Workers in the field will continue to do the same jobs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be no job losses during this phase, which peaks on July 1, the date set for staff transfers to the new municipalities, but the possibility exists that municipalities will cut staff after restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In some instances they may have to take on new staff. The guiding principle is that staff will follow function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process is being managed under a series of agreements struck at the Metropolitan Restructuring Forum in conjunction with a Metropolitan Labour Forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six municipalities and the metropolitan council are represented on the restructuring forum, and all unions and employers on the labour forum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agreement has been reached on provisional post allocations for each new local authority. The next phase, likely to be the trickiest, is putting a name to each of those posts and dealing with disputes. Provisional allocations are 1 600 for Blaauwberg , 1 500 for Helderberg, 1 700 for Oostenberg, 3 600 for South Peninsula and 7 000 for Tygerberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town municipality has about</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Malaria has killed some 500 people in Zimbabwe since the start of the rain season in November, a Zimbabwean government minister has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Timothy Stamps, the minister of health and child welfare, said on Monday in Harare that 255,000 cases were attended to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told some of the continent's top scientists, attending the Medic Africa'97 exhibition, that the health challenges facing African and other developing countries remained &quot;as daunting as ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Malaria remains the biggest killer with Zimbabwe recording over 255,000 cases with nearly 500 deaths since the start of the current rainy season,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country is enjoying one of its best rain seasons in many years, creating moist conditions favorable for breeding of malaria-causing mosquitoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Present malaria deaths compare with only about 200 that had been reported over the same period in 1996, with the final toll that year being more than 2, 000 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The three-day Medic Africa '97 event is an international medical exhibition which takes place alongside conferences and seminars by mainly laboratory scientists from both Anglophone and Francophone Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meetings during the convention include updates on HIV/ AIDS research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The HIV/AIDS pandemic continues to decimate critical human resources and overwhelm the health care system with no respite in sight,&quot; Stamps said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coupled with that was the &quot;vengeful&quot; return of tuberculosis, which had since become more difficult to treat and cure. The disease had hitherto been brought under control through immunization and multi-drug therapy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These challenges and reverses, he said, should spur the scientists to seek new solutions to &quot;old problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NYABUSOZI, Uganda (PANA) - Deborah Tunakunda, a 35-year-old housewife in Nyabusozi district, southwest Uganda, has been brought up and conditioned to endure pain and suffering without complaining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In our culture and tradition, we must learn to disregard pain, and to live with debilitating symptoms and conditions,&quot; she narrates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deborah and other Ugandan women, like their counterparts elsewhere in Africa, are never acknowledged as sick or unwell until they literally collapse, by which time it is usually too late to do any thing to help them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the traditions of the Banyankole, Tunakunda's ethnic group, a woman must not make noise or cry out when delivering a baby - it is shameful and a sign of bad upbringing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;She must endure the pain quietly.&quot; Banyankole men will in fact expect to hear only the cry of the new-born, not of the mother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the health point of view, according to Uganda's First Lady, Janet Museveni, this situation cannot be allowed to continue, as women are now required to undertake even greater tasks within the African society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She made this point clear recently when officially opening the first East, Central and Southern African Obstetrical and Gynecological Societies conference on reproductive health towards the next century, which ended in Kampala on April 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to her, even the current talk of women empowerment through education, political representation and legislation, and also through new economic opportunities, cannot be realized if the health of African women continues to be neglected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Is it possible to empower human beings whose physical bodies are feeble and ailing?,&quot; she wondered, stressing that the question of reproductive health was a pivotal one in the larger issue of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At their conference in Kampala, held from April 6-11, the African obstetricians and gynecologists &quot;brainstormed&quot; on how to strengthen reproductive health services, adolescent health, maternal mortality, abortions, the effect of HIV infection on pregnancy and other related topics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted with concern the rising teenage pregnancies which were reported to be the highest in Uganda on the whole African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants from Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe and Sweden decried the high mortality rate in their countries which ranges between 200 and 1,000 per 100,000 live births.  Out of this mortality, 20 to 35 percent is attributed to induced abortion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health experts noted that among adolescents - the future parents - sexually transmitted diseases are higher than among the rest of the population. This includes HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These factors prompted Janet Museveni to urge the participants to deliberate upon the causes of such harrowing statistics and the possible remedial measure to put in place to &quot;halt the pace at which we lose such large sections of our population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;First, there is a great need to re-educate our communities about the need to utilize the health facilities that are becoming more and more available, to teach women the importance of ante-natal and post-natal visits to the clinic,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The medical personnel, midwives and traditional birth attendants must also be taught the importance of sanctity of life and the fact that they are there to save life and not simply watch as women die while under their care&quot;, she added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, according to the chairperson of the Association of Obstetrics and Gynecologists of Uganda, Dr. Florence Mirembe, the task of changing attitudes on reproductive health could not be accomplished by medical workers alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Everyone, men, women and the medical profession, we must all be sensitized to do it - from the school room, to the pulpit, to the political podium, to the public performers, to the grassroots leaders,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the conclusions of the conference was to erase the separation between economics and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants said it was impossible to have a strong economy if more than half of the population, &quot;more than half of the work force is in poor health.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - As he turned 75 last Sunday, Tanzania's first president, Julius Nyerere, deplored the country's low life expectancy rate of 52 years and challenged authorities to do something to raise it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He attributed the low life expectancy rate to the loss of millions of working years because Tanzanians die when they are still very young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere, popularly known as Mwalimu (teacher), said this in Dar es Salaam in a speech to thank the organizers of his 75th anniversary party, which was attended by over 100 guests in Dar es Salaam.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the life expectancy in most developed countries was around 70 years. He told the guests that his wish was to see as many Tanzanians reach that age, which, he said, was standard according to the Bible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think the trend to believe that living up to my age is a privilege should stop and instead it should be the age standard for Tanzanians,&quot; said the former president, whose head is now all grey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the incumbent president, Benjamin Mkapa, who was among the guests, that to achieve that, the government has to cut down infant mortality to ensure that children survive their first five years after birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere, who is an ardent Catholic, said that although life expectancy has risen from 35 years at independence in 1961 to 52 now, Tanzania was still far behind the Biblical standard which &quot;is four scores&quot; (80 years).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he hoped to reach the age of 80 as many members of his family have reached that age. His mother, Mugaya Nyerere, is now 100 years old.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere, who led Tanzania for a quarter century, after the country's independence from Britain, said he hoped to see the fourth president of the country, after Mkapa (59), who he hopes will complete his two terms of office in 2005.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope I will see the fourth Tanzania president,&quot; said Nyerere, who was succeeded in 1985 by Ali Hassan Mwinyi (71). Mwinyi retired two years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe, Graham Hill, on Wednesday in Harare, called on African states to be united in rejecting AIDS clinical trials based on skin color.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a keynote address to the fifth congress of the Association of Medical Laboratory Scientists, Hill said there had to be justification why a particular country is used for such trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Clinical and drug trials have to be exposed to international scrutiny, and justification given as to why a country becomes a center for such HIV/AIDS trials,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trials that only involved developing countries and none of the industrialized countries should be treated with caution, and their rationale fully justified before implementation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africa should unite in rejecting, in the strongest terms, trials that are based on the principle of color, for in fact they do not seek knowledge, but seek to perpetuate the inequality of mankind, and proof of idiosyncratic self- appeasing theories,&quot; said Hill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The failure to date by scientists to come up with a cure or vaccine for HIV/AIDSs had led to callous exploitation of people living with AIDS through false claims of cures by money-mongers and quacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Meanwhile, people living with AIDS on such treatment become unsuspecting guinea pigs, and even if they suspect that something is amiss, their condition renders them powerless to do anything about it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia's minister without portfolio Michael Sata on Wednesday accused the U.S government of hostility toward the government in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the U.S Ambassador to Zambia, Arlene Render, and visiting State Department deputy director for Southern African countries, Gerard Gallucci maintained that Washington will not relent on its demand for good governance in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two envoys made this position clear during an exchange of views with Sata concerning Zambia's current political situation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata claimed that if the government had not acted with tact, an uprising could have occurred in the country, instigated by what he termed undeclared sanctions by the United States in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata engaged the duo in a heated debate, during which he accused Washington of bias against Zambia by condemning what it perceives as undemocratic activities by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accused the U.S. government of not taking such actions against unnamed countries in the sub-region whose democratic records were not as impressive as that of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sata cited the constitutional changes of 1996 as one of the issues on which Washington had adopted a negative stance against Zambia and yet the changes reflected the people's wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have treated us with utmost political hostility for the past few years, through your undeclared sanctions which have led to reduced levels of aid to Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are too hard on us and we find this to be very unfair because we have adhered to democratic principles of designing policies initiated by the people,&quot; Sata said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In her response, Render maintained that Washington will closely monitor President Frederick Chiluba's ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) to ensure that it observes good governance which she said was inseparable with economic performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will not let you off the hook on good governance and we will knock at your doors whenever we notice slippages on this matter,&quot; Render said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. government was among other donors that had cut aid to Chiluba's government after the adoption of the 1996 amended constitution, which the U.S claimed was undemocratic because it limited the number of aspiring presidential candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It only allowed Zambian citizens with both parents also born in the country to contest for presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following the amendment, former President Kenneth Kaunda was barred from standing against Chiluba in the November 1996 presidential election. Kaunda's parents were from Malawi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARUSHA, Tanzania (PANA) - African leaders who met in Arusha, northern Tanzania on Wednesday decided to maintain sanctions against Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, the leaders widened the areas which will not be affected by the economic blockade, which was imposed on July 30, 1996, after Maj. Pierre Buyoya seized power in Bujumbura five days earlier.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to Zambian journalists before he left for Lusaka, Chiluba said the exempted imports include food, agricultural produce and implements, medicines and educational materials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said the leaders have decided to maintain the sanctions to compel the military junta in Bujumbura to fulfill all the conditions set under the embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions were imposed by Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Tanzania, Cameroon and Zambia after Buyoya toppled the civilian government of Slyvestre Ntibatunganya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are aimed at among other things, to force the military junta to restore the national assembly, un-ban political parties and undertake unconditional negotiations with all parties to the conflict, including armed groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders noted that while some progress has been made to fulfill these conditions, extra efforts should be made by the junta in Bujumbura to realize all the conditions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the protestors dispersed, some groups of youths vandalized shops and stoned state-owned vehicles as well as those of other private motorists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malian opposition parties have since Monday been agitating for the nullification of the first round legislative polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also called for the resignation of the government and the independent national electoral committee, for failing to organize proper elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's demonstration had been outlawed by the the ministry of territorial administration and security, which said it would do its best to ensure the security of citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties have complained that last Sunday's polls were not free and fair because the organizers failed to provide enough voting materials including voters' cards registers, ballots papers and ballot boxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the electoral commission attributed the failure to all Malian political actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Preliminary results indicate that the ruling coalition of President Oumar Konare, the Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA) was leading in several constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition parties have already said they will not take part in the run-off election on April 27 as well as in the presidential poll scheduled for May 4, unless there is proof of transparency.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - A former Kempton Park regional court prosecutor was sentenced to 27 years in jail by the Nelspruit regional court on Wednesday in connection with hijacking a van carrying more than R300 000 in pension money, and attempting to murder three policemen in Bushbuckridge four years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gundo Justice Lidhovo (33) of Pageview, Johannesburg, has no previous convictions, and was a monitor for Independent Electoral Commission during the 1994 election and is a trustee of the South African National Civics Organisation (Sanco) in Pageview.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo was found guilty of hijacking a van carrying R351 601 in pension money on March 11 in 1993, and firing at three escort policemen at Casteel, near Bushbuckridge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was arrested shortly afterwards at the Pietersburg/Zebedelia T-Junction by Sgt SGP Oosthuizen, who heard about the robbery over the police radio network and saw Lidhovo standing with another man next to the boot of a white Jetta sedan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man allegedly ran away when Sgt Oosthuizen approached them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sgt Oosthuizen arrested Lidhovo on finding a trunk containing the stolen R351, 601 and pensioners' vouchers, an AK 47 rifle and a firearm in the boot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo pleaded not guilty, saying he had been hijacked on the way to Pietersburg and that the hijackers could have loaded the weapons and money into the boot of his car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have never possessed any ammunition, rifle or fire-arms in my whole life, &quot; Lidhovo told the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution speculated that Lidhovo was part of an organised gang, which used the van as a getaway car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only reason you were caught is because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time and otherwise would've gotten away with it,&quot; Magistrate Albertus le Roux said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo was sentenced to an effective 10 years for stealing the money and the van, 12 years for attempted murder, three years for the unlawful possession of a firearm and five years for the unlawful possession on an AK 47 assault rifle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo has appealed against the sentence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo was awarded his B Juris at the University of the North in 1985 and, in 1986, received his LLB from Unisa, and began his career in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo was an advisor to a parastatal attached to the Venda Development Corporation, which advised communities on how to use VDC resources for land purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also a director of Moweni, a legal advice bureau in Venda which assisted detainees, helped establish trade unions and referred cases to Lawyers for Human Rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lidhovo also led a project creating political awareness in the community before the 1994 elections and established an education project which helped students acquire bursaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also worked as a legal officer for national insurance company, Old Mutual.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - The persisting pension payout problems and inability of government officials to submit acceptable financial statements timeously are indicative of serious record keeping and capacity problems in Mpumalanga, said the Auditor General, Henri Kluever, in Nelspruit on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the official opening of the Provincial Auditor General's offices, Kluever said that similar problems occurred in other provincial governments and had to be tackled immediately if politicians wanted to ensure efficient and accountable local government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a great pity that, as auditors, we cannot always be positive. But unless these issues are recognised and addressed they will only grow. By pointing them out, we have no ulterior agendas or double agendas - only our public accountability,&quot; he explained.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems, which are largely due to poorly trained or motivated staff and not necessarily corruption, was being addressed by the introduction of open sessions of Public Accounts Committees, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The opening of these committee sessions to the general public is possibly one of the best innovations of our new democratic government. By being there and participating directly in keeping officials accountable by asking questions, officials suddenly realise that they must answer to the tax-payer for their financial management,&quot; Kluever said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Tough public accounting goes hand in glove with any strong democracy and also ensures value for money for service from the lowest clerk to most senior politician.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new Nelspruit offices unite the various units or components of the AG's office which operated in the former home lands of KaNgwane and KwaNdebele, as well as the eastern part Transvaal, for the first time under a single Provincial Auditor, Douglas Maphiri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maphiri and a team of specialists from the AG's corporate services office in Pretoria are currently concluding a special report on alleged wide-scale financial mismanagement at the Mpumalanga Development Corporation (MDC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The performance report was launched after allegations that the MDC's controversial managing director, Patrick Mogorosi, had defrauded the parastatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogorosi recently resigned and took a package rather than face an internal disciplinary hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AG special report will be released in roughly two to three weeks time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This type of investigation is part of our new pro-active approach to auditing in South Africa. We have to remain relevant and make meaningful contributions both on the normal accounts and on matters of public interest,&quot; explained corporate services executive manager, Louis van Rooyen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelspruit - When South Africa's popular deputy speaker of Parliament, Baleke Mbete, accepted an offer by Mpumalanga politicians to &quot;make it easier&quot; to get her driver's license, she thought it would simplify her life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, she is now one of 44-people being investigated by the police for possession of a fraudulent license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbete did go through the motions of testing for the license on October 1 last year, after being whisked from Johannesburg to Delmas by the personal car of Mpumalanga's safety and security MEC, and escorted by his personal bodyguards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, despite being met and tested by the provincial traffic director, Henry Brazer, himself, there are no official records of the test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the temporary license which she now uses to drive her car wasn't issued in Delmas as per Department of Transport regulations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, it was secretly issued one day earlier more than 350km away in the former homeland of KaNgwane, sometime during the night of September 30.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have refused to comment on the case but a Sunday Times investigation has also found that Brazer may not be qualified as a testing officer, as he is not listed as certified on the national NATIS traffic data system and that licenses issued at Kabokweni are still governed by old K52 regulations, while those at Delmas fall under more recent legislation requiring the more difficult K53 test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An internal departmental investigation into the irregularities was, however, quashed by senior officials and politicians in the safety &amp; security department, while the man who brought the incident to their attention, John Muller, is currently facing disciplinary action and possible dismissal for &quot; non-attendance&quot; at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpumalanga's director of traffic, Henry Brazer, who Mbete insists personally tested her in Delmas, refused point-blank to even discuss the matter this week for fear of &quot;incriminating myself&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not prepared to give you any information at all - the police are investigating and I am not going to incriminate myself either to you or in court,&quot; he said when Sunday Times finally tracked him down in Cape Town on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It doesn't matter that I'm a public servant, I will not talk to you or anyone else. As far as I am concerned the matter is sub-judicae.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Refusing to accept that cases are only sub-judicae once they are in court, Brazer refused to say whether he was in Delmas on October 1 or to explain why Mbete's license was issued at the Kabokweni Test Centre in KaNgwane - after normal work hours and without the knowledge of staff there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazer also refused to comment about another internal government investigation into his admitted irregular use of State funds to pay for a family holiday to the USA while he still worked for the former KaNgwane traffic department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he signed a confession admitting to misusing State funds at the time, he was promoted to provincial traffic head after simply repaying the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Claiming to be unaware of the police investigation, Mbete insisted this week that the license test had been personally set up for her by Mpumalanga safety &amp; security MEC, Steve Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am a very busy person with children scattered all over the country, a job in Cape Town and a constituency in KwaZulu. I don't have time to stand in queues,&quot; she explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, because every time I saw Steve in Cape Town, he was always insisting that I should come to Mpumalanga for my license, I took him up on the offer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stressing that she had already written her Learner's License in Cape Town, and that she had paid for the Delmas test, Mbete denied any knowledge that the license had actually been issued in Kabokweni.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How can this be corruption? I am not required to stand in queues at airports and things, and this was just like that - just a little facilitation to make life easier,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MEC Mabona also vigorously denies that there is anything wrong with either the special arrangements to have Baleke tested or with the fact that there are no records at Delmas and that her license was actually issued 350km away from where she wrote it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people in Pretoria, who say that it's a problem, don't fucken know what they're talking about. I am the boss of traffic here, so you listen to me,&quot; insisted an aggressive Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I personally organised this thing and know about it. It just doesn't matter if the license was issued somewhere other than were it was tested. And if the officials in Delmas say they don't know this, then they are lying and are racist.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Explaining that because he knew that &quot;most test centre officers and heads are still white and racist, I didn't want this type of thing where ministers are treated like slaves or called kaffirs. So, I made special arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are just targeting Baleke because she is black. If you write this stuff, you are a National Party pawn and are abusing the openness of our new government. But you have an agenda and can fuck off and write whatever you want. I was not made by newspapers, so do what you want,&quot; said an agitated Mabona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delmas Test Centre head, Pieter Evenson, confirmed that his centre had no file for Mbete on Friday and insisted that she could therefore not have officially been tested in Delmas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Look, it's impossible to be tested and not have a file. There's just no other way of doing this legally. And, there is also no way that my files, records or licenses would land up in KaNgwane, because I would simply not send them there,&quot; he explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Also, if the provincial director of traffic were to specially test someone here at my centre, the arrangements would have been made through me. I never saw or heard about anything like this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Safety &amp; security's departmental head, Advocate Stanley Soko, admitted this week that he had been informed about the irregularities just weeks afterwards and that he had written a letter ordering that an internal investigation into the incident be dropped immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also ordered, in the letter, that Kabokweni's 'master' license books, which had been confiscated to preserve evidence, be returned to the Kaboweni centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was furious when I heard about the investigation. It was not being done according to the proper channels and was causing friction, so I wrote the letter. I admit that there was no formal investigation after this but I did verbally quiz Brazer and was satisfied with his explanation,&quot; explained Adv.  Soko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then admitted, however, that he did not bother checking Brazer's story with either the Delmas or Kabokweni test centre heads or with the traffic officer, John Muller, who brought it to the department's attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, despite the fact that Muller has previously the same officer who played a key role into fraudulent license investigations which landed 11 government officials from three departments in court for selling driver's licenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muller was also instrumental in re-opening the inquiry into Brazer's State paid holiday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Muller is a trouble maker. He causes tension and friction in the department and just never turns up for work. He claims it is because he is being victimised by Brazer for this holiday thing, but I cannot tolerate a public official getting paid for not being at work,&quot; Soko said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have stopped his salary and we have started disciplinary steps aimed at dismissing him for non-attendance and mis-conduct.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adv. Soko claimed to be unaware of the police investigation and insisted that because no formal complaint had been made by anyone he had not been obliged to investigate the allegations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WITBANK - The cost of supplying water to Mpumalanga's biggest town, Witbank, is set to increase after the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) informed the council that it would have to replace a major R2,5-million water conduit between the town and the Witbank Dam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to SABS inspectors, the existing pipe is so badly rusted and corroded that it can no longer be used economically and may also influence the quality of water supplied to Witbank.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The additional expenditure for the pipeline comes shortly after the council was forced to pay R11 600 to replace one of four water pumps servicing the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to council spokesmen, it costs Witbank Town Council at least R27, 9-million per year to provide water it its residents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SECUNDA - Police have recovered the police vehicle stolen by one of Gauteng's most dangerous prisoners, who escaped from police custody on Wednesday, while being transported to court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petrus Dan Molefe (32) allegedly overpowered his police guard before stealing the officer's police vehicle, pistol and cellular phone, African Eye News Service (South Africa) reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molefe also took a police two-way radio and three fully loaded Uzi machine- gun magazines with him.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesmen said on Friday that they had recovered the stolen Opel Astra in Duduza, Thokoza, near Thembisa in Gauteng late on Thursday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the vehicle was undamaged, none of Sergeant Jan Hattingh's (26) possessions were recovered. There was also no sign of Molefe himself and police have warned the public that he is dangerous and should not be confronted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molefe escaped from police custody while being transported from Boksburg Prison to Volksrus Magistrate's Court to be trailed on armed robbery and vehicle theft charges. Molefe, who is already serving a prison term for a R100 000 bank robbery, is also wanted in connection with bank robberies in Mpumalanga and North West Provinces. AK47s were used in all the robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The still shaken police escort, Sergeant Jan Hattingh (26), spoke to African Eye News Service (South Africa) shortly after the escape and told them that Molefe waited until the vehicle they were travelling in was on a deserted stretch of road before pulling a pistol from under his shirt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He was hand-cuffed and I don't know where he got the weapon, but he meant business. Knowing his history as one of the most dangerous prisoners in Gauteng, I was so scared that I did exactly as he commanded. I thought he was going to kill me,&quot; Sergeant Hattingh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He took my stuff and ordered me out of the car. Then, still hand-cuffed, he drove off towards Springs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after Hattingh notified police about the incident, police helicopters from Gauteng were diverted to hunt for the missing Opel Astra stolen by Molefe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We still don't understand how Molefe, who was picked up by the escort directly from his cell at Boksburg Prison, could have got hold of the pistol he used to over power his guard,&quot; added Mpumalanga police spokesperson, Captain Benjamin Bembe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Describing Molefe as &quot;very dangerous and violent&quot;, Bembe said police were still conducting a province wide hunt for the escapee, as well as a search of Soweto's Zone 2, where Molefe comes from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police are also investigating Molefe in connection with one murder, one attempted murder, one rape and previous escape charges.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - American evangelist Franklin Graham is making thousands of Cape Town children smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The son of renowned veteran evangelist Billy Graham, Franklin Graham yesterday visited Nomlinganiselo Primary School in Crossroads, where he distributed 1 200 of 20 000 gift-wrapped boxes he has brought to the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gift boxes contain T-shirts, toys, sweets, stationery and other items packed by children in the United States, Britain and Canada.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a lot of work to be done in Africa,&quot; said Mr Graham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is making an evangelical tour of South Africa, as his father did years ago. Franklin Graham has previously been to several African countries, including South Africa, which he first visited 14 years ago as president of Samaritan's Purse, an international Christian relief organisation. With his wife Jane and daughter Sissy, he is on a mission to bring hope to the needy and underprivileged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gift boxes for needy children are part of Operation Christmas Child, a Samaritan's Purse project. Last Christmas a million children in 36 countries received gifts from the project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The American entourage includes journalists, bodyguards and a singing cowboy. The guests were welcomed at Nomlinganiselo by enthusiastic pupils and were entertained by the school choir and pupils performing traditional dances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Graham brought his own one-man choir in the form of giant singing, guitar-strumming cowboy Dennis Agajanian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We decided to come to South Africa because the country is one of the great nations in the world and has so much natural beauty. Everyone is looking to South Africa because it is the key nation in Africa,&quot; said Mr Graham.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Graham travels the world overseeing relief projects through Samaritan's Purse, and conducts at least 10 campaigns each year for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, of which he is first vice-chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will conduct services at Newlands cricket ground on Friday and Saturday at 7.30pm, and on Sunday at 3.30pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Special arrangements have been made for the disabled and senior citizens.  Extra trains and buses have been organised throughout the Peninsula to transport people to and from the stadium.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - We citizens of the new democratic, non-racial, non-sexual, non- sensical South African are all suffering from an overdose of reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ever since Nelson Mandela came out of his 27 years of hell and gave us three years of heaven, everyone has been sighing a gasp of relief. We made it! No exile, no bloodshed, no retribution. The rich got richer and the poor think they're in power. Democracy does it again!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For years, the farewell toast at boere dinner parties was &quot;Next year Paraguay!&quot; And now here we still sit, albeit with a friendly black majority government in power, and very little has changed for us whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Irritating things do happen more often. The trains don't run on time like they used to. But then that was also the problem after Mussolini was killed.  Whites don't usually take trains; we have cars. Blacks don't take trains either; they prefer taking our cars! Vehicle hijacking rivals robbery and murder in the Top of the Bloody Pops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is affirmative action. And so there should be, knowing that whites ran everything while blacks sat and watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It all now means that experienced people are sent into the platteland to grow vegetables, while unlettered potential voters become managing directors.  Forget not the golden handshakes that are being passed out at the expense of reconstruction and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Millions are being paid to the former henchmen of apartheid to get them out of their jobs peacefully, hoping that they won't flood the computer network with computer viruses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no punishment, just early retirement - in itself, sometimes a welcome reward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tata Nelson is now best friends with those very Afrikaners who locked him up! He is dinner guest to those Jewish businessmen who kept apartheid going and now support the AN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is polite to those Dutch industrialists who slyly circumvented sanctions in the '80s by sending their product to Pretoria via Taiwan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africans can now get away with murder. And we do, daily. The amnesty cut-off date for those who admit to committing crimes during, and after the apartheid era ended, has been moved so many times, it is worth killing someone you don't like today. Because tomorrow you're bound to get a new amnesty cut-off date!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former fascist Broeders are still in control of the most sensitive areas of society. Look at the SABC, military, the police, the arts and business. Now they just say &quot;Comrade!&quot; without throwing up!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, there have been great improvements. Children are going to school hand in hand, in spite of background and colour. Life is going on, despite the culture of negative gossip that will not allow optimism to breed hope. No one can believe that we can have a future in an African democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what about now, in 1997? Desmond Tutu, our Truth Fairy, has waved his wand of compassion and humanity and made the Truth Commission acceptable to most, no matter how one hates hearing That Truth about our past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murders, the torture, the assassinations, the pain and the horror that was our responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Tutu's watchful, often tear-filled eye, the victims only ask for the names of those who killed their loved ones, in order to forgive them! Dear God, where in the world would one find such simplistic goodness?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So is reconciliation working?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course it is. I'm still here. As a white Afrikaner I am as guilty as any other white for the dark past. Even though I was anti-apartheid and not anti- South African, there is little memory today of some aspects of our struggle.  The parliamentary portrait of that feisty fighter for human rights, Helen Suzman, is lying on the rubbish heap of the past, next to Hendrik Verwoerd's portrait and P W Botha's picture. There is no sentiment, little thanks, scant truth. Just history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But will history really bother itself with this small hiccup of goodwill?  When Nelson Mandela goes - no, when he dies, and sadly he will die - what will happen to South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will the lid fly off like in Yugoslavia after the death of Tito?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While there are potentially great leaders waiting in the wings, there are also many upstarts and troublemakers. There is a frightening lack of discipline in our politics. MPs arrive in Parliament filled with passion and care and hope and honesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within months, they are corrupt and decadent and can't be told apart from the old National Party of apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violence is tearing us asunder. It is not political violence; it is just criminal madness. Murder and mugging, theft and fraud, have become the way of life and the butt of bitter jokes. The senseless killing of children and their mothers, the horrifying rape of women and innocents, is now being committed just for the fun of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have sowed what we now reap. And because of this orgy of reconciliation, there can be no punishment. After apartheid's culture of death, we dare not have a death penalty for those who in turn create a new culture of bloodshed.  No punishment for the rapists who rape every 14 seconds in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A nation free of the burden of capital punishment? Yes, a great and noble liberal ideal. But in a confused crossover society, liberalism is as useless as a key without a lock. We have the greatest liberal constitution the world has seen, but no government strong enough to protect it at the expense of its popularity with the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, if any small, silly party fights the 1999 election on the restoration of the death penalty, they might win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The letters ANC now not only stand for &quot;African National Congress&quot;, but &quot;A Nice Cheque&quot;! We have the best government money can buy. Gangsters and drug barons send their dollars to party coffers and move into suburbia unmolested.  Beijing offers the ANC a bigger cheque than Taiwan, in exchange for official diplomatic recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Don't be shocked. Don't be alarmed. It's quite normal. It's confused and corrupt; it's enlightened and sublime; it's infuriating and priceless. It is muddied by human touch and clouded with human weakness. It's called democracy and it's working fine! At least South Africa is, at last, being run by us, the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in a democracy like ours, politicians very often are like monkeys. The higher they climb the pole of ambition, the more of their arses we see!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The Electoral Steering Committee has warned Parliament that the 1999 elections could fail if legislation is not processed urgently. New maps are also needed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994 the world looked on benignly as South Africa held its momentous election: so what if there were hiccups in the poll which would forever move the country away from its evil past and towards a democratic future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the event there were problems throughout the process, casting some doubt on its eventual accuracy. A similar scenario would probably have been unacceptable in many another country at the time, but the result was accepted as free and fair. The country was close enough to the brink; it simply had too much to lose from a failed election.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 1999 and the second free election approach. It would be stretching a point to suggest that as much will be at stake this time round, but it is not unreasonable to expect the nature of this election to have an impact on perceptions about South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the new country proceeds towards the 21st Century it is battling to stave off concerns (mostly unfair ones) that it is vulnerable to corruption.  It is also beginning to labour under a belief that it is not exactly a model of efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A less-than-perfect election in 1999 will strengthen these perceptions. It may be unfortunate, but it is perceptions that often shape critical decisions such as whether a country is worthy of investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is, therefore, vitally important that the government listens to the warnings of the Electoral Steering Committee and gets preparations under way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And it might bear in mind the small matter of cost. Elections do not come cheap and South Africa will most certainly not be able to afford a repeat if the 1999 election monitors decide that the process has not been a fair one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The KWV was dealt a severe blow yesterday when its application to convert to a company was postponed in the Cape High Court to August 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court ruled that Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs Derek Hanekom could become a party to the KWV's application to convert into a company, allowing him to complete investigations into issues relating to the conversion. These include the future regulatory environment of the wine industry, the competition implications and questions relating to some of the assets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister earlier opposed the KWV's application on the grounds that it could lead to the collapse of the regulations controlling the local wine and spirits industry, and would also see it benefit from the &quot;privatisation&quot; of assets which were generated through the exercise of its statutory powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hanekom welcomed the ruling, but added: &quot;I want to make it clear that I do not wish to stand in the way of the KWV's plans to become more competitive, and to be in a better position to develop its foreign markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I do have several concerns about specific details relating to the KWV's proposed restructuring, and the court has granted me the right to address these over the next few months.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the extra time would allow him to complete the investigation into KWV's assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harvey Weiner, managing director of auditors Fisher Hoffman Sithole, who heads the investigating team, told the court it would take at least three months to complete the task of determining the nature and value of KWV's &quot; substantial&quot; assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said he hoped that it would be possible for the parties to reach a negotiated settlement that would address the major issues in the time granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would like to see a new dispensation where the interests of everyone - new entrants, growers, producers, workers, wholesalers and consumers - are addressed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Lourens Jonker said he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; that the KWV's application to convert to a company had been postponed again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We agreed in December to give Mr Hannekom three months for his investigations and gave our full co-operation to the three commissions appointed by him,&quot; Mr Jonker said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It now appears as if the minister and his advisers are ignoring these lengthy and costly investigations and we believe this delay will lead to further abortive expenses for both the KWV and the taxpayers.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Music icon Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown is a musician who just cannot be categorised and makes no bones about telling you that he plays American and World Music - Texas- style.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With more than 50 years in the entertainment business behind him, he knows what he's talking about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown was in town recently for the announcement of the line-up of the Standard Bank Jazz Festival which forms part of the Grahamstown Festival in three months time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown made headlines when he arrived in South Africa by entertaining fellow passengers with his sublime fiddle-playing for three hours non-stop, when their flight was delayed at Johannesburg airport. At the launch in the Waterfront he demonstrated his consumate skills on guitar and fiddle and it was clear that here was a man who really enjoyed his music.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brown is a seven-time Grammy nominee whose career is enjoying one of its hottest streaks and a blaze of nominations during the past two years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm a man who looks for artistic perfection while blending a number of musical styles and influences to create my music,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Jazz, blues, country, swing, funk and zydeco, they're all there and I just like taking it to audiences all around the world.&quot; This style and class has earned Brown praise from fans and the international media alike and has singularly qualified him as a spokesman for American music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This may seem strange in a world where the biggest moneyspinners in the music world, at times, seem devoid of talent and rely on trendy videos to catch the customer. But Brown feels that there is a change happening in people's tastes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They're growing tired of being fed trash under the guise of creativity and there is a movement towards hearing actual talent and artistry in music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Today the recording industry is geared too much towards the fast buck, with one-hit wonder artists popping up all over the place and then you never hear of them again,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the proof that talent will always survive over hype is with people like me who are still going strong and whose music is finding new and younger audiences all the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Too much of the music produced for the younger lot is not creative.  They're simply covering a lot of the old stuff that happened before and putting it into other packages.&quot; said &quot;Gatemouth&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in 1924, Brown was raised in Texas and it was his father Tom who introduced him to music, giving him his first lessons on guitar and fiddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His father was a specialist in country and western as well as Cajun and bluegrass music but Brown also listened to his blues albums by people like Tampa Red, Blind Boy Fuller and T-Bone Walker as well as the swing of Count Basie, Woody Herman and Lionel Hampton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the music of country artists that left the biggest impression on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he was 16 he joined his first group, playing drums and touring Texas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1949, he joined a 23-piece orchestra playing at the Keyhole Club and two years later he was spotted by producer Don Robey, who took him along to Houston to play at the famous Bronze Peacock Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don knew that there was something inside me that had hits written all over it and we went to Los Angeles to record on the Aladdin Label,&quot; said Brown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unfortunately for them they did not have the same confidence and gave the recording very little promotion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Don decided to record me on his own behalf and songs like Okie Dokie Stomp, Boogie Rambler and Mercy on Me became big sellers in Texas and established my reputation as a performer.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Up to 1960, Brown recorded with the cream of the crop of Texas musicians, also touring with Dinah Washington, Sonny Stitt and Gene Ammons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1965 he went into semi-retirement in extraordinary fashion. He became the sheriff of Durango County in Colorado and did not re-surface until the 70s, when he took part in the 1973 Montreaux Jazz Festival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess I needed a bit of a break from the music business just to gather my thoughts and because I was disappointed after an audition for the Chess Label in 1965,&quot; he said. &quot;After Montreaux I felt good about my music and went on to record several albums in France as well as doing stuff with jazzmen Arnett Cobb, Milt Buckner and Jay McShann.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then Brown has had little respite, undertaking tours all over the world and garnering many awards for his albums.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1982 his release Alright Again won him a grammy for Best Contemporary Blues Album and he was in the news again last year with a nomination for his album The Man. This year he was again on the list of nominations with his album Long Way Home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm just a guy who likes to make music and share it with the rest of the world,&quot; he says. &quot;If it makes you happy it makes me happy, and that is what music is all about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you're heading for Grahamstown for the festivities in July you'll be able to catch &quot;Gatemouth&quot; in action at the Monument Theatre on July 8 and 9 and experience that happiness for yourself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - A number of South African pilgrims have been reported missing after being swept up in a stampede to safety when fire raged through two tent towns in the Islamic holy city of Mena, killing 217 pilgrims and injuring about 1 300.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of the two million pilgrims on the annual haj (pilgrimage) to Islam's holy citadel of Mecca were caught in the human tide of panic-stricken people fleeing the flames and were swept away from relatives and friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although none of the 8 000 South African pilgrims in Saudi Arabia for the haj were listed among the dead, some camped in the area were reported missing by relatives and friends trying to locate them early today for the climax of the haj, the Day of Wuqoof - day of atonement - on the plains of Arafaat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of fleeing pilgrims were reported today to have reached Mecca, about 11km away.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheikh Abdurahmaan Gafieldien, head of the legislative department of the Majlisush-Shura-al-Islami in Cape Town, described the fire as tragic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said: &quot;We all mourn the loss of lives and our sympathy lies with the bereaved families.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses described mass panic as flames, driven by fierce winds, raged through the white tents, pitched closely together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Huge palls of smoke blacked out the sunlight on the plains of Mena as the emergency services battled to cope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many of the dead - mostly Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, Syrians, Egyptians, Sudanese, Lebanese, Yemenis and Moroccans - were said to have been crushed in the rush to escape the blaze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pilgrim Suzanne Kassem said: &quot;It started off with just small puffs of black smoke. It spread in size until the day looked like night. Gas tanks were exploding everywhere like bombs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People were running around. It was mass hysteria. Everyone was running around like cattle. The fire broke out as some of the 2 million pilgrims were beginning to move en masse towards Mount Arafat. Some witnesses said it was caused by a gas canister used for cooking; others blamed faulty wiring in air conditioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As news of the main fire spread, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that a second blaze had broken out in the Iranian encampments on Mount Arafat, 19km south-west of Mecca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the blaze broke out, Saudi television showed pictures of many of the pilgrims in their traditional dress - two simple white sheets for men and long white or black robes plus headscarves for women - carrying umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun as they made the journey to Mena, chanting: &quot; I have answered your call, God. There is no one God but you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tragedy was a serious embarrassment for the Saudi authorities, who are the proud guardians of the world's two holiest Islamic sites at Mecca and Medina, and have spent $18,6-billion (R83-bn) extending facilities in Mecca.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shortly before the blaze, Saudi officials claimed that they had been doing their best to ensure a safe haj for the pilgrims from about 100 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it is obliged to perform the pilgrimage once. But the haj has been dogged by tragedy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The worst one was seven years ago, when 1 426 pilgrims died in an overcrowded tunnel at Mena, probably because of a breakdown of the ventilation system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in 1994, 270 pilgrims, most of them Indonesian, were killed in a stampede in Mecca when the crowd surged forward uncontrollably towards a cavern for the ritual of &quot;stoning the devil&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fire, hostage-taking, political disturbances and bombings have also taken a huge toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1987 402 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims, were killed and 649 wounded in Mecca when Saudi security forces clashed with Iranians staging an illegal anti-US and anti-Israel demonstration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most dramatic incident was in 1979, when several hundred armed men hostile to the conservative Saudi government barricaded themselves inside Mecca's Grand Mosque for two weeks, taking pilgrims hostage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fighting claimed the lives of 153 people and 560 were injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year later 301 passengers were killed when a Pakistani jet caught fire after a passenger lit a kerosene stove in an aisle to brew tea.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A director in the Ministry of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Mukwaita Shanyengana, appeared in the Windhoek Magistrates Court yesterday on 15 counts of fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shanyengana is charged with defrauding Government of more than N$11 000 through submitting false subsistence claims and travelling allowances between November 1990 and September 1991.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pleaded not guilty to all 15 charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State alleges that the Lands director defrauded Government or alternatively stole the money from Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The misappropriation of State funds was detected during investigations by the Frank Commission in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the testimony of one of the former investigators in the Frank Commission, Jacques Malan, Shanyengana sometimes allegedly claimed twice the subsistence amount or added an extra amount to his claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one example, the State charges, Shanyengana claimed N$2 926,83 instead of the correct amount of N$2 712,95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another case, he allegedly furnished invoices for breakfast at a Windhoek hotel, while he had been out of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was also alleged that Shanyengana bought bricks and claimed the money from Government and bought personal goods such as parts for his vehicle, leather items and groceries and used the receipts to claim for refunds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The total amount he allegedly received fraudulently is estimated at N$11 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case was yesterday postponed until May 28 as Shanyengana's legal representative, Petrus Damaseb, requested more time to check all the court documents related to the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate Leonard Simasiku presided and Charles Visser prosecuted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources yesterday announced a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for pilchard of 25 000 tonnes and a TAC for horse mackerel of 350 000 tonnes, up from 250 000 tonnes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hifikepunye Pohamba assured Parliament yesterday that this level of fishing was consistent with scientific information available on stocks, and that this would help support the fishing industry in a lean period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House was told that the conditions which had caused catches to dwindle had disappeared and marine environmental conditions off Namibia had returned to normal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There were also signs that conditions may have been particularly favourable for spawning in 1996, and these conditions were continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The position was much more favourable for pilchard and horse mackerel stocks, which grow much faster than hake which takes around two years before it can be harvested economically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister commended Norway and Iceland for providing assistance, especially in the fields of research and surveillance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even though Norway was scaling down its assistance to Namibia, its fisheries aid would be extended for a further three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Pohamba made it clear that his Ministry had rejected any strings tied to European Union grants to the fishing sector and stated that joint ventures between local companies and EU partners had been reviewed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I can confirm that we have made our policy clear to the EU that any agreement would not involve the allocation of quotas to EU vessels of EU companies.&quot; He added that the EU had accepted Government's position on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing off-shore diamond mining, the Minister said its impact on fish, especially rock lobster, was an issue that concerned the people of Luderitz and would be given serious attention in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on regional co-operation, Pohamba revealed: &quot;Namibia has successfully continued its work in co-ordinating the marine fisheries sector within SADC&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He highlighted some of the progress such as the launching of the benefit programme, which supports a co-operative science plan between Namibia, Angola and South Africa, aimed at improving knowledge on the Benguela Current System.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another achievement was the completion of the feasibility study on regional needs in the area of monitoring, control and surveillance, and also the implementation of a regional project to assist SADC states in quality control and inspection of fish products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Ministry needed to replace and upgrade vessels for surveillance and research, and to train and recruit more inspectors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More staff in areas such as economics, planning and law were required to cope with the expected increase in the size of the fishing sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - Allegations of racism have reared their ugly head at the eastern Namibian town of Gobabis, with a woman who unwittingly rented accommodation in a &quot;whites-only&quot; block of flats being given a one-month deadline to leave the premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newly-appointed Telecom employee, Dianne Arendse, had been in the flat for only two days when some of her white neighbours allegedly complained to the landlords about 'her presence'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, they threatened to quit their flats if the Telecom employee was allowed to stay on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The owners, apparently an &quot;oldish white woman&quot; and her brother, known only as Mr Blaauw, from Pretoria, bowed to pressure from the tenants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arendse has been told to go.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mayor of the eastern town, Rehabeam Tjirivanga, has been informed about the incident and confirmed to The Namibian yesterday that he was very angered by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is totally against the Constitution ... There are still some elements in the town who seem to not respect the Constitution. The Council will not tolerate such people,&quot; Tjirivanga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arendse recently took up employment with Telecom at Gobabis and approached Josephine Bailey, an employee of the Blaauws, over accommodation at the block of flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey, who works at a bottle store owned by the Blaauws, is responsible for handing out keys to new tenants on instructions from a local auditing firm which handles the Blaauws' financial matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey did not inform the auditors that Arendse was &quot;a coloured&quot; as she did not think the flats were allocated along racial lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The auditors gave the go-ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arendse paid her deposit and her first month's rent and happily moved in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days later, Arendse was contacted by Bailey who informed her that the owners were not happy that she had been given the flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey told The Namibian that Blaauw had called her from Pretoria to enquire who had given her permission to allow &quot;the coloured&quot;, Arendse, to rent the flat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (Blaauw) said I was busy chasing the white people away and that he will come within two weeks,&quot; Bailey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Bailey, the white tenants had lodged a complaint about Arendse, threatening to vacate their flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contacted for comment, Arendse confirmed that she had been informed about her &quot;illegal presence&quot; at the flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I feel they are discriminating against me. I am aware of the Prevention of Racial Discrimination Act which states no one should discriminate against the other. I will take up the issue with Mr Blaauw,&quot; Arendse said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She did not want to elaborate further but said she felt hurt and that it had been a blow to her dignity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said not even during the colonial period had she encountered this sort of treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All efforts to get hold of the owners of the flats proved fruitless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest incident comes in the wake of recent efforts by the Town Council to break down racial barriers at the eastern town .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recently the Wennie du Plessis secondary school was in the news over alleged racism, but the community, together with the Ministry of Basic Education, managed to restore peace there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another achievement is that black farmers can now take part in the annual Gobabis Cattle Show, something that never happened in the past.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A veil of secrecy surrounds negotiations between proprietors of the beleaguered Rosh Pinah Zinc Mine and the mine's mineral rights holders PE Minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nothing concrete has emerged although new negotiations reopened in January after the Australian mining company, Western Metals, which had indicated interest in purchasing the mine, pulled out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And workers at the southern Namibian mine say they cannot stomach the uncertainty which has haunted them since 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rosh Pinah Mine Manager David Southey told The Namibian yesterday that negotiations were &quot;in progress&quot; between Imcor directors and PE Minerals players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he could not give any indication on when these would be finalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its a long process and its not easy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not something that can be sorted out in a day or two,&quot; Southey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also emerged that an assurance given to Rosh Pinah employees by Government that the matter would be finalised by the end of last month was now fuelling uncertainty at the mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Southey, however, the delay in finalising the mineral rights issue had not in any way affected production at the mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have kept people (employees) focused on the mine since February 1995.  In fact we have managed to increase production,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said mining operations would continue until the rights issue was sorted out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PE Minerals, a consortium of Namibian and Malaysian businessmen, holds the mining rights for Rosh Pinah but does not own the mine and its assets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government's decision to award the Rosh Pinah mining rights to PE Minerals, which did not own the mine, has raised more than a few eye-brows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following protracted negotiations last year, PE Minerals and Western Metals failed to to reach an amicable solution resulting in the Australian base metal giant deciding not to proceed with talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PE Minerals also failed to reach an agreement with Iscor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was established that the deadlock in the negotiations between PE Minerals and Western Metals resulted from PE's stand that it should have the major stake in the mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Metals, which had indicated that it would pump about N$165 million into the mine if it eventually took over ownership, was not prepared to settle for a minority stake in the mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Ministry of Mines and Energy said it would intervene if the negotiating parties failed to reach an agreement on the rights issue this did not happen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - A lack of financial resources is blocking the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry to probe &quot;possible problems&quot; concerning the licensing and safety of aircraft in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Works, Transport and Communication deputy minister Dr Klaus Dierks told The Namibian yesterday that around N$500 000 was needed to establish the high- level commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no foot dragging. The lack of half a million (dollars) is the only reason. Otherwise we would have appointed the commission already. It is urgently needed,&quot; Dierks said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he added, efforts were underway to get the necessary funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The probe follows the crash of a Cessna 210 in the Naukluft mountains in southern Namibia at the beginning of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five people lost their lives in the air accident, which has opened up a bitter public row among pilots and others in the aviation industry over the cause of the accident and the air safety situation in Namibia in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission will investigate possible problems within the aviation sector and assess how the level of licensing and aircraft safety can be improved through the necessary technical or even legal actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Dierks said his Ministry was in the process of getting high-level international aviation experts to the country in the next few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Another couple of weeks and the findings of the Commission will be known,&quot; Dierks said at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy minister has not ruled out the possibility that the findings of the Commission might result in changes being made to Namibia's aviation safety laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It can be that our current legislation is not good enough or has loopholes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commission will look into all this,&quot; Dierks said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusations and counter-accusations in aviation circles were fuelled by the Cessna crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane was piloted by the experienced Dirk de Meyer, who was flying passengers Koos Koekemoer (68), his wife Driekie (63), their daughter Martha Bekker and son-in-law Koos Bekker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They all died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry ordered an investigation into the accident and initial reports have allegedly ruled out fire as the cause of the crash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the final report has yet to be released by the Ministry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - The High Court of Zimbabwe on Thursday ordered authorities at the Mutare-based Africa University to re-instate more than 250 students who were suspended this week following an 11-day boycott of lessons in protest against a hike in school fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The high court, sitting before Justice Chinhengo in Harare, the Zimbabwean capital, declared the suspensions null and void.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judge gave the university 10 days to file its opposing affidavits with registrar of the high court in Harare if it so wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his ruling, Justice Chinhengo said that the withdrawal of scholarships from the suspended students by the Vice-Chancellor had &quot;no force or effect&quot;, and ordered that students be allowed to enjoy the rights and privileges they were entitled to before they were suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also ordered the university authorities to meet all the costs of this suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suit was filed by the students representative council through their lawyers after the institution, run by the United Methodist Church, failed to comply with the demands contained in a letter sent to the university on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers asserted that the administration had acted improperly by suspending the students en-masse without specifying the charges against each individual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A university official confirmed receipt of the letter from the students' lawyers, adding that the response would come through its legal representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Except for 33 students studying for a masters in business administration degree, about 270 students started boycotting lectures soon after the university announced a 17 percent increase in fees.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARUSHA, Tanzania (PANA) - Burundi's military ruler, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, has welcomed Wednesday's decision by African regional leaders to ease sanctions against his country, describing the measure as a very important step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters after the summit, he said the leaders &quot;decided to lift sanctions on all food items and those things which concern the ordinary people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the action was an important step toward peace in his politically and ethnically divided country, although he had hoped for greater concessions from the African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, who attended the summit for the first time since the embargo was imposed July 1996, after he seized power, said the ban had also been lifted on agricultural products, educational and construction materials and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the sanctions only hurt the common people and fuel Tutsi extremism in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders imposed sanctions on landlocked Burundi to force Buyoya to return the country to constitutional rule and open unconditional talks with the largely Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya said he is ready for these talks. However, hardliners within the Tutsi-dominated army and the former military ruler, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, are opposed to such talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's regional summit on the sanctions was the first attended by Buyoya. He was welcomed as &quot;president&quot; at the talks by host Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia were at the summit. Others were Prime Ministers Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Pierre Rwigema of Rwanda. The Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and the international mediator on Burundi, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere also attended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan (PANA) - The Sudanese army said Thursday it had killed hundreds of Ugandan troops west of the southern Sudanese town of Juba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Documented proof, which will be shown on the state television later on, shows that the invading forces moved from (the) Gulu military area where the Ugandan Fourth Division is stationed,&quot; it said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement read over state-run television, the army said after the western attack failed Tuesday, the Ugandans advanced from the south but were stopped 44 miles short of their target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese army said that it was supported by the militia, called Popular Defence Forces, who counter-attacked the Ugandans from the rear &quot;completely wiping them out, killing over 306 and destroying five tanks and capturing four others, all of them modern.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese Army General Command, which issued the statement, said there was no significant participation from the anti-government Sudan People's Liberation Army in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan has often accused Uganda of supporting the guerrillas in their effort to overthrow the Khartoum government, a charge Uganda has often denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The army said that among those killed was the deputy commander of the Fourth Division. It said the commander of the division was killed in an earlier first attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese army accused &quot;malignant colonization circles&quot; of providing Uganda with state of the art military equipment and with which to capture Juba, the largest town in southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there has been no independent confirmation of any of the army's claims.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Tanzania has said it will deploy paramilitary forces along its border with Zambia to check arms smuggling from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Minister for Home Affairs, Ali Ameir Mohamed, said that the force would be drawn from the Field Force Unit (FFU).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview, the minister said the force will be dispatched to recover arms already smuggled or likely to be smuggled through the common border.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said police officers were already investigating the arms smuggling network starting from the southern border town of Tunduma in Mbeya region and in the western regions of Rukwa and Kigoma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ameir Mohamed said the police action was prompted by the rising incidents of banditry due to an incessant influx of refugees from Rwanda, Burundi and lately from Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are in a final stage of launching a campaign against illegal possession of arms, particularly in areas close to our borders,&quot; he said, adding that areas to be marked out for special surveillance include Ngara in Kagera region, Kigoma, Rukwa regions and Tunduma in Mbeya region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said close cooperation had been sought with the Zambian police force to contain cross border crime. He added that reports suggest that arms were being smuggled into Tanzania through Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the minister, poor liaison among the police in the two countries and lack of communication had led to an increase in cases of cross border robbery and car theft in the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the arms smuggling was being carried out by a syndicate involving gangs of thieves in Tanzania and Zambia. These smuggle the arms from Zaire to Zambia and finally to Tanzania. The triangular border situation serves the syndicates perfectly, the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohamed Ameir said the Tanzanian border town of Tunduma was now reputed to be a major transit point for criminals from the various countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - In an attempt to facilitate trading of Ashanti Goldfields Equity on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the company has created a facility called the Zimbabwe Depository Receipts (ZDR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing business people at a meeting held in Harare on Wednesday, Ashanti Goldfields Zimbabwe managing director, Michael Marriot, said the facility would enable shareholders on the Zimbabwe register to exchange each Ashanti share they held for 100 Ashanti-Zimbabwe depository receipts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ashanti ZDRS would be listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange and, he said, it was anticipated that the price of a ZDR on the ZSE would be approximately one hundredth of the current trading price of Ashanti shares on the ZSE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If all Ashanti shareholders on the ZSE opt to convert their Ashanti shares into ZDRS, it is anticipated that the volume of trading in Ashanti will increase as a result of the fact that shareholders would have more Ashanti securities in which to deal,&quot; Marriot said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in order to set up the ZDR facility, Ashanti had entered into an agreement (the ZDR agreement) with Deloitte and Touche Executor and Trust Company (Pvt) Limited (the depository).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marriot said some of the main provisions of the agreement were that in respect of every Ashanti share lodged with the depository, 100 ZDRS would be issued and freely transferable. Upon execution of a common form of transfer, a ZDR holder might withdraw his Ashanti shares from the depository at any time, by surrendering his ZDR certificate(s) to the depository on the last day of business each month. A ZDR holder would also receive in respect of each ZDR, one hundredth of any dividend paid on an Ashanti share.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Use of the ZDR facility was voluntary and shareholders were not obliged to use it, but it was recommended as it was expected to produce benefits in terms of enhanced tradeability of Ashanti securities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the acquisition of the Freda Rebecca Mine in Bindura, the single largest gold mine in the country, Ashanti Goldfields, one of the top ten producers in the world, became one of Zimbabwe's largest investors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the take over of the British-based Cluff Resources in January 1996, Ashanti has added immense value to the company's operations with major investments in exploration, production and mine development. Speaking at the same meeting, Mark Keatley, the company's chief financial officer said Freda Rebecca, with a ten-year life, produced 100,000 ounces of gold per year at a cash cost of USD 230 per ounce (zimdollars 2,530).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since acquiring this mine, Ashanti has achieved an increase of 770,000 ounces in resources and an eight percent increase in annual gold production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Expansion of the treatment plant in 1997 will realize an additional increase in production from 1998 onwards,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ashanti had also added value by refinancing the long term debt of the Zimbabwe operations, resulting in a saving in interest costs of one million dollars (ZD 11 million) per year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keatley said the company had made rapid progress in exploration in Africa and was active on some 35 projects in 12 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Including exploration at our mine sites, we plan to spend USD 25 million (ZD 275 million) on exploration in 1997,&quot; Keatley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the company's gold hedging programme had been a success with virtually the whole of scheduled gold production this year hedged at USD 445 (ZD 4,895) per ounce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, he said, would protect the company's cash flows during the current period of weakness in the gold price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe the gold market will recover its equilibrium and remain bullish in the long term,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's operating cash flow was between usd 150 million (ZD 1.65 billion) and USD 160 million (ZD 1.76 billion) a year and was expected to rise significantly after 1998 with the completion of the Bibiani gold project in Ghana and Siguiri project in Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase in cash flow, together with the programmed decline in capital expenditure was expected to result in INL002 from SSS.069 (970417-16:59) QN PANAINL .PANADKR MSG068G/02E PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PANA PAN(2) substantial free cash flows which would service the company's debt and fund the next generation of projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, Keatley said, the company had been drawing on debt facilities to fund their investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We anticipated these needs and that is why Ashanti has been active in the financial markets in the last two years. We have successfully tapped the equity, loan and bond markets to finance our growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are particularly proud last year to be the first African operating company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DARWANDALE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Women have made some in-roads in the field of journalism worldwide, but there are still many hurdles which they have to overcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These range from frustrations at the work place and the reluctance by society to accept female journalists in their own right without casting doubt on their moral integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These issues were discussed during the International Association of Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT) bi-annual conference which was held in collaboration with the Federation of African Media Women in Zimbabwe (FAMWZ).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rinki Bhattacharya, a television film producer from India, said the marginalization of women in society is carried over to the work place where they find themselves isolated in a &quot;man's field&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are seen as people of loose morals because of the work we do,&quot; said FAMWZ chairperson Mavis Moyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nonee Walsh, of Australia, said there was an attempt to maintain the field of journalism as a &quot;boys' club&quot; where women are often made to feel lonely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The newsroom of today still reflect a 'boys network'. No matter how intelligent a woman is, the men maintain this feel of it being a man's world so a woman cannot fit in,&quot; says Norwegian journalist Mette Janson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female journalists are often frustrated at work and hardly get promoted even when they excel, said Ropafadzo Mapimhidze a sub-editor with the Herald in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Media women feel that their male counterparts travel widely and get major assignments while opportunities for further studies are often reserved for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This helps them to qualify for promotion while women remain with basic training often below degree level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gender sensitivity is lacking in most media reports because women are not in decision-making positions that enable them to control news and the way womenfolk are portrayed. It has also been noted that some news sources prefer to deal with male journalists whom they have more confidence in, thus alienating female journalists who are just as competent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Janson strongly felt that women have to work twice as much as their male counterparts to prove their worth while male journalists can afford to be lax and still earn respect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Isa Edholm said although there are more females attending schools of journalism now, particularly in first world countries, large established newspaper companies are turning to universities for male journalists in an attempt to fend off women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women also complained of lack of newspaper space and air time for their articles and programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inge Von Bonninghausen from Germany, said issues concerning women are normally given attention when they have a negative aspect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She cited coverage of the September 1995 Beijing conference as an example where most relevant discussions went unreported while confusion and mistakes made headlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, women have to resort to having a women's page or a specific slot in order to be heard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is, however, a general feeling that these pages and programmes are often ignored by men and could be futile since gender issues require the participation of both sexes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The women also share the common problem of being unable to market or to get sponsorship for their programs in the face of cheap imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These forces working against women in the media have resulted in most female journalists joining public relations houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of Zimbabwe sociology professor, Rudo Gaidzanwa, noted that it was not only female journalists who face problems, but the portrayal of ordinary women and their participation in the media needed improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the ever-increasing emphasis on consumerism that comes with economic growth disadvantages women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Increasingly, we are being confronted with advertisements and commercial messages which target girls and women of all ages inappropriately and which market women in degrading images to sell products,&quot; Gaidzanwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simonette Rassampanina of Madagascar said many television programmes stereotype women, particularly in advertisements where they are either seen as consumers or commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Janson, however, women display little interest in news because it has very little of their experience and they do not identify with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A total of 80 percent of news stories are about men while women take up 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indian university lecturer and journalist Jai Chandiram said even the camera focus on women portrays them as weak and vulnerable while men are shown as powerful, confident and dominating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To reverse these trends, IAWRT and FAMWZ members passed a resolution recommending that female journalists should distance themselves from programs that stereotype and undervalue women in society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Programs on social issues should be aired on prime time so that the whole community can participate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Female managers and producers should generate interest and become the voice of the voiceless and work in solidarity with other women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">IAWRT was assigned the duty of assisting in the collection of the data on the image and development of women in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Journalists should network at all stages from grassroots to international level and female media practitioners should join and work with women's groups.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARUSHA, Tanzania (PANA) - Burundi's military ruler, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, has welcomed Wednesday's decision by African regional leaders to ease sanctions against his country, describing the measure as a very important step.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to reporters after the summit, he said the leaders &quot;decided to lift sanctions on all food items and those things which concern the ordinary people.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also said the action was an important step toward peace in his politically and ethnically divided country, although he had hoped for greater concessions from the African leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, who attended the summit for the first time since the embargo was imposed July 1996, after he seized power, said the ban had also been lifted on agricultural products, educational and construction materials and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the sanctions only hurt the common people and fuel Tutsi extremism in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders imposed sanctions on landlocked Burundi to force Buyoya to return the country to constitutional rule and open unconditional talks with the largely Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya said he is ready for these talks. However, hardliners within the Tutsi-dominated army and the former military ruler, Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, are opposed to such talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wednesday's regional summit on the sanctions was the first attended by Buyoya. He was welcomed as &quot;president&quot; at the talks by host Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presidents Daniel Arap Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Frederick Chiluba of Zambia were at the summit. Others were Prime Ministers Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Pierre Rwigema of Rwanda. The Organization of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim and the international mediator on Burundi, former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere also attended.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - On March 7, an anonymous caller left an &quot;angry message&quot; on the telephone answering machine for privately-owned newspaper Okavango Observer.  The paper's editor Caitlin Davies told MISA on April 11, that the caller was apparently not pleased with an article published in a March 7 Edition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper had reported that the government was offering cash incentives to villagers in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve to move out of the area. It also reported villagers as alleging that the government had threatened to &quot; shoot&quot; those refusing to move out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The March 14 edition of the Observer quotes the anonymous caller as saying: &quot;... This is about the so-called forced removal of Bushmen... It is surprising really, just why do white people come down from their countries and mess up other people's countries, why can't she (The Okavango Observer editor) mess up her own country? And to tie the death of Mr. Hardbattle with the Basarwa (Bushmen) relocation, I just find it a bit sinister if not subversive...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Caitlin Davies is, however, a Motswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its response to the message, the paper argued that the public had a right to know that villagers were being offered cash to move away from their ancestral land. Democracy, the paper went on, means freedom of speech, it means every citizen has the right to air his/her views. The paper, however, observed that the anonymous call came when Botswana had just been heralded as a good example of democracy. This was said at the African Commonwealth meeting in the capital Gaborone this February.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Federation of Journalists is very concerned by the detail and emphasis of the Media Council of Zambia Bill 1997, and the fact that it was drafted without genuine consultation with the profession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas no reference is made to the rights to freedom of expression and access to information, there is detailed and dangerously wide reference to disciplinary procedures to be taken against journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFJ supports the establishment of procedures to promote the maintenance of high professional standards but these should be created and undertaken by the profession. There should be a clear Code of Principles to which all journalists are bound, and upon which complaints against journalists can be based and assessed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Provisions to incarcerate journalists should not be contained in a Press Bill. If, like any other citizen, a journalist commits a criminal offence, he should be prosecuted under the criminal law. A Media Council should not have the authority to deprive a journalist of his/her liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The registering of people practising journalism can be provided for, but the granting of permission to practise as a journalist should not be provided for in legislation. Journalists can be accredited through various means, including by press organisations, but accreditation should not be a requirement for the undertaking of journalistic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registration should not be handled by the same body responsible for disciplining journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government officials should not be involved in the accrediting or disciplining of journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Bill, by creating very restrictive criteria for the granting of accreditation and by placing accreditation in the hands of a body which has no codes or rules by which to guide its decisions, other than those it chooses to adopt, ensures the closing down of the profession of journalists to all but the favoured few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFJ rejects this proposed Media Council, and urges the Zambian authorities to consult with the profession to create frameworks for self regulation and to desist from supporting legislation intended to control access to and the exercise of the profession of journalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFJ also makes the following detailed remarks on certain parts of the Bill:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Composition of the Council</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The members of the Council should not be appointed by the Minister of Information. They should be accepted once proposed by their organisations, the Ministry should not be involved in the appointment or supervision of Council members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministry involvement could compromise the independence and efficiency of the Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disciplinary Committee</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 10</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Disciplinary Committee should be made up of media professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Registrar and other Staff</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 13(3) is unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">n Is the Registrar a member of staff appointed by the Council who then becomes an ex officio member of the Council, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* is he one of those listed in Article 6 who becomes Registrar, or</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* is he ex officio to the Council from some other body?.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This should be clarified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first and second versions are acceptable but the latter is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qualification for accreditation as a journalist</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 15(c) and (d), in our opinion are excessive. Whilst the IFJ fully supports high levels of training for journalists, this proposal does not seem to further this aim in a constructive manner and could lead to the exclusion of many professional journalists from accreditation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, there is no provision for those who have received in house training, there is an emphasis on academic qualifications but not on apprenticeships or experience. Further, if the requirements contained in this Bill remain, the only way for the profession to be accessible in a fair and pluralistic way would be for the government to guarantee free and open access to the relevant training institutions for all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Effect of non-accreditation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Does this mean that one can practise as a &quot;non-accredited&quot; journalist?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why can accredited newspapers only be owned and operated by accredited journalists?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 18(2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is too vague. The penalty units should be defined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Annual Subscription</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 21 is unacceptable. It would be acceptable for journalists to pay fees to their organisations which may then send a percentage to the Council, but a journalists' accreditation should not depend on his/her financially supporting the Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, public funds should also be used to support the Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disciplinary Proceedings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 23. It should not be up to the Registrar to charge journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There should be a complaints procedure outlined whereby a complaint must be made, whereupon the Council - or a subcommittee thereof - will examine the complaint and should it contain an allegation of a breach of professional ethics, the charge can then be formulated and sent to the journalist concerned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before any Disciplinary Proceedings can be included in legislation, there must be a clear definition of what amounts to a breach of professional conduct. We suggest the incorporation of the IFJ Code of Principles as the basis for such proceedings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De-accreditation of journalists</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If a journalist's accreditation is to be removed the voting procedures within the Council must be defined. It is insufficient to rely on the voting rules contained in the first part of the Bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a de-accreditation to occur, there should be a vote of at least two thirds of all members of the Council in favour (and not only two thirds of those present).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Article 27</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This article is incomprehensible, which is very serious given that it includes provision for the imprisonment of journalists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - U.S. Agency For International Development, Bureau for Humanitarian Response (BHR), Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) . ZAIRE - Complex Emergency, Fact Sheet 12, Fiscal Year (FY) 1997, April 17, 1997. Note: The last fact sheet was dated April 15, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Background: In mid-October 1996, fighting broke out in South Kivu, Zaire between the Zairian army (FAZ) and the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (Alliance) led by Laurent Kabila. The fighting caused Rwandan and Burundian refugees to flee, forcing over 700,000 Rwandans and 62,000 Burundians to repatriate by the end of 1996. Hundreds of thousands of refugees also fled west, scattering in small groups deeper into Zaire. The fighting spread north, west, and south, with the Alliance gaining territory on all fronts. The Alliance now controls approximately one-third of Zaire.  Following the capture of Mubji-Mayi on April 5, the Alliance seized Lubumbashi, on April 9. Three days later, the Alliance seized Kananga, 150 km northwest of Mubji-Mayi, and announced it would reach Kinshasa by June.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haut-Zaire Province: Approximately 91,741 Rwandan refugees are clustered in groups along the 125 km rail line west of the Zaire River, south of Kisangani: 26,916 at km 25, 30,000 at km 31, 32,000 at km 41, 2,500 at km 82, and 325 in Ubundu town. On April 13, USAID's Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) field officer flew to Ubundu town and noted about 100 of the 325 refugees are extremely vulnerable. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) plans to move the refugees by train to km 41 once the weak are stabilized. Humanitarian agencies have set up therapeutic feeding centers, water sources, medical facilities, and services for unaccompanied children at each site. Although 160 cholera cases have been reported at km 25, the cholera is a non-virulent strain and is restricted to km 25. Medecins Sans Frontieres International (MSF/I) is treating refugees in two isolation tents and is confident that it can treat the cholera effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WFP has chartered two barges, each with a capacity of 250 metric tons, to transport food from the municipal airport to the refugees. On the return trip, the barges can be used to transport refugees acrosss the Zaire river.  Currently, the Alliance is not allowing use of the international airport because it was mined. UNHCR plans to commence the air repatriation of refugees on April 18, beginning with 80 unaccompanied children who will be flown to Goma and given care prior to repatriation. Approximately 850 internally displaced persons (IDPs) were flown from Kisangani to Goma during last week. On April 14, the Alliance gave permission to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to use Bukavu airport for airlifting IDPs, many of whom originate from Bukavu. The British Overseas Development Agency is establishing an air logistics cell in Goma and a transportation unit in Kisangani, which will control air, road, and river movements for the repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kivu Province: Since April 1, UNHCR has repatriated more than 25,000 refugees. Nearly all of the refugees that emerged on March 31 near Karuba, 13 km west of Sake, and Tongo, west of the former camps of Katale and Kahindo, north of Goma, have been repatriated. Less than 1,000 refugees remain in Karuba, however more are arriving daily. MSF/I provides new arrivals with shelter, sanitation facilities, and blended food for children. In Kindu, west of Shabunda, USAID/DART's Goma field officer found very few refugees and 909 IDPs -- 806 living with families and 103 in an old depot in the center of town. The IDPs and locals appeared healthy with adequate water sources and sanitation. The most important needs are medical equipment, medicines, and water treatment chemicals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasai-Oriental Province: At least 30,000 refugees are moving towards Angola.  They are believed to be the group who fled the Shabunda area camps in South Kivu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. Government (USG) Assistance: On March 14, USAID/DART arrived in the region to help advance relief efforts in eastern Zaire. USAID/DART installed an information officer in Nairobi and field officers in Goma and Kisangani.  BHR/OFDA has provided grants to ICRC to assist Zairian IDPs and repatriating Rwandan refugees and to Save the Children/UK for vulnerable Rwandan and Zairian unaccompanied children. The State Department's Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration has provided funding to ICRC and to UNHCR for IDPs and refugees in eastern Zaire. Between December and February, BHR's Office of Food for Peace provided roughly 2,500 MT of food to eastern Zaire from the Rwanda Regional Program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Geneva - The International Secretariat of OMCT requests your URGENT intervention in the following situation in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brief description of the situation : Working Together for Human Rights, a member of the network, has expressed its grave concern over the arrests of Mr.  Frangois Ugirashebuja and Mr J.-Dieu Nsanyurwimo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to information received, security services allegedly arrested Mr Frangois Ugirashebuja on 7 April 1997 while he was at work at the laboratory of the Bushenge hospital, prefecture of Cyangugu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr J.-Dieu Nsanzurwino, judge at the Court of first instance of Kigali, nephew of Mr Frangois Ugirashebuja, was reported to have been arrested on 1 April 1997 whilst the court was in session. According to the same information, Mr Nsanzurwino did not leave Rwanda during the period of genocide and was the target of investigation on the part of the security services before his reappointment to his former position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These arrests, for which the motives are still unclear, are believed to be connected to the death by torture of Mr Sylvestre Gatera (son of Mr Frangois Ugirashebuja) at Cyangugu on 3 September 1995. He was arrested on denunciation and died at the Brigade of Gisama, prefecture of Cyangugu. Dr Rugumba Ernest, a doctor at the hospital in Bushenge, concluded that Mr Gatera Sylvestre's death was caused by torture. The doctor observed several wounds to the head, body and extremities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The International Secretariat expresses grave concern over these arrests, specifically due to the fact that Mr Frangois Ugirshebuja had allegedly been subjected to pressure by the Commander of the Gendarmerie Brigade of Cyangugu to contradict the medical expert's report. Mr J-Dieu Nsanzurwimo had taken several steps to ensure that those responsible for his cousin's death are held accountable. Due to this, it is feared that the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Frangois Ugirshebuju and Mr J-Dieu Nsanzurwimo are in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action requested: Please write to the Rwandan authorities urging them to:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">i. guarantee the physical and psychological integrity of Mr Frangois Ugirashebuja et Mr J.-Dieu- Nsanzurwimo;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ii. order their immediate release in the absence of valid charges or, if such charges exist, bring them before a competent and impartial civil tribunal and guarantee their procedural rights at all times;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iii. open an impartial and exhaustive investigation into the death of Mr Sylvestre Gatera and the pressure of which Mr Frangois Ugirashebuja was victim, identify those responsible, bring them to trial and apply the penal, civil and/or administrative sanctions provided by law;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">iv. ensure in all circumstances the full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with national and international standards.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Statement by TRC Commissioner Dr Wendy Orr, 16 April 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the first day of a two day meeting, the INMDC (Interim National Medical and Dental Council) agreed to endorse a decision taken by the INMDC Executive, to present a submission at the TRC's Health Sector Hearings in June. The submission will be made on behalf of the previous SA Medical and Dental Council by the present President of the INMDC, Prof S. Kallichurum, past President of the SAMDC, Dr L. Becker and present Registrar of the INMDC (who was also Registrar of the SAMDC), Mr Nico Prinsloo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After discussion, the Council decided that the submission should cover &quot;the functioning of the Council in relation to Human Rights&quot;, &quot;action taken or the failure to act in specific issues and cases, such as the inequality of facilities available to various sectors of the population&quot;, issues which the Council should have raised with, for instance, the then Dept of Health and, most importantly, lessons which can be learned from past mistakes and how they can be prevented in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, the Council discussed the matter of &quot;amnesty&quot; for doctors.  Amnesty granted by the TRC does not extend to amnesty from professional discipline in the case of health professionals. This could deter health professionals who have information about, colluded with or participated in human rights abuses from approaching the TRC, as they would still have to face INMDC disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The INMDC reached the conclusion that it is bound by statute to discipline health professionals found guilty of professional misconduct or negligence, but &quot;full and voluntary disclosure&quot; would be taken into account as a strong mitigating factor, as would an appropriate explanation of the context and environment in which the transgression took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The INMDC would obviously consider each case on its own merits, but would apply similar principles to those presently outlined in the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act (the so-called &quot;Norgaard Principles&quot;), in deciding on mitigation and sentence. This offer of mitigation would stand as long as the TRC is in existence (i.e. till 14 December 1997).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nico Prinsloo is co-ordinating the compilation of the submission and the President of the INMDC called on all past and present members of the INMDC and/or SAMDC to assist the Council in drawing up its submission, by communicating to Mr Prinsloo any issues which should be highlighted or examined.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The vast majority of minibus taxi operators are law-abiding citizens who provide a vital service. A new initiative that has been launched will, hopefully, promote peace and order in the industry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The firm action taken by Peninsula law enforcers against recalcitrant minibus taxi drivers this week will be welcomed by motorists and law-abiding taxi operators alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a six-hour blitz by traffic officers, army and police, 159 fines were issued for various offences, including 43 for unroadworthy vehicles, 40 for drivers not being able to produce licences and 23 for drivers who could not produce public drivers' permits.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main thrust of the operation was to ensure that all taxis were displaying their route stickers, a measure designed to eliminate the violence which has plagued the industry since its inception.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only seven fines were issued for this offence which seems to indicate that taxi operators are co-operating with the authorities in this important programme to end the tragic loss of life in the so-called taxi wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant by-product of the operation was, however, the number of taxi drivers caught in the net for other offences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vast majority of minibus taxi owners and drivers are law-abiding citizens who play a very vital role in transporting hundreds of thousands of people to and from work every day - swiftly and at moderate cost. If the minibus taxis stopped operating, the wheels of commerce and industry in this city could come off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there is a small minority in the taxi industry who do not obey the rules and quite often openly flaunt them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the operators who put vehicles on the highways which are not in roadworthy condition and which are a danger to other road users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are unlicensed drivers, too, and those who display arrogance and contempt for the rights of other road users.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's campaign and the warning that those who fail to pay fines or appear in court will be arrested is, hopefully, a clear signal to the anarchists that their era is coming to an end.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town -Madiba magic is being used to bolster Cape Town's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela is to make personal telephone calls to members of the International Olympic Committee especially those in Africa to canvass support for the bid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This key strategy is among those now coming on stream as South Africa intensifies the lobbying of Olympic votes. With less than five months to go before the September 5 vote, deploying &quot;Madiba magic&quot; has become a strategic imperative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki are to give up more of their time for personal contacts with IOC visitors, at least 54 of whom must vote for Cape Town if the city is the win the race to host the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maintaining and strengthening contact with the African members of the IOC is critical this 20-strong bloc represents nearly half the number of votes the bid needs to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president and deputy president will seek to assure the IOC of the national commitment to tackle crime head-on, to convince them that South Africa's democracy is stable and that the institutional framework of the state will guarantee political and economic stability in a post-Mandela setting. There are 40 confirmed IOC visits lined up, and the bid team is hoping to increase this number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been four visits so far, and the fifth visitor, Louis Guirandou- N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast, arrived last night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bigger role for Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki in the present critical lobbying phase was one of the main items on the agenda at a meeting this week between Mr Mbeki, other senior government officials and the Bid Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A month ago, it was felt especially in Europe that South Africa's inclusion in the shortlist was just a &quot;concession&quot; and a reward of sorts for South Africa's &quot;miracle&quot; transition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This month, though, the influential international sport newsletter Sport Intern reports that observers now place Buenos Aires last in the race.  Furthermore, the editor and publisher of Sport Intern, Karl-Heinz Huba, notes: &quot;Here and there, there is alarm that an appearance by Nelson Mandela before the IOC session (in September) could turn all the technical-rational considerations upside down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to this, Nocsa treasurer Kurt Hipper told the parliamentary sport portfolio committee yesterday: &quot;This shows how important the Madiba magic is, and we must work on this now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bid Company finance director Michael Fuller and other members of the bid team made it clear that while IOC visitors so far had left with very favourable impressions of the city as an Olympic venue and of the technical details of the bid plan, key concerns were crime and future political and economic stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Fuller also made it clear that the bid &quot;desperately needs&quot; more money to run an effective, competitive lobbying campaign over the next few months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shortage of money had limited the bid's capacity to make the most of the recent athletics event at Green Point stadium and at events during the recent visit of foreign navies to the city.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Three new, top calibre male dancers will perform for the new Cape Town City Ballet when it makes its debut at the Nico tomorrow night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formerly Capab Ballet, this will be the Cape Town City Ballet's first season as an independent company, and the appearance on stage of the trio is a further vote of confidence in the new company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny Bovang, one of the dancers who will appear in The Story of Manon Lescaut, a ballet specially choreographed by Veronica Paeper, was born in Norway and did his early training there before moving to the Royal Ballet School in London. He joined Pact Ballet in 1983 and was promoted to principal dancer in 1992. In 1996, he became senior principal dancer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what brought him to Cape Town?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well, I felt it was time for a change,&quot; he says. &quot;It all happened very quickly. I took my voluntary retrenchment package, and the next thing I knew I was looking at Table Mountain between rehearsals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny, a celebrated classical dancer, has a repertoire ranging from the classics to works by Balanchine, Ashton, Nureyev, Hynd, Goh, Cranko and Fokine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I felt I was running stale at Pact after 14 years,&quot; he explains. &quot;I want to work with other people, experience other teachers. I'm loving it here.  It's just too wonderful. I'm inspired, I'm enjoying my dancing, it's a challenge working with the company and I'm actually improving.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manon is a ballet he has always wanted to do, he says, but the combined experience of a new company, a new city and a new ballet is proving the big thrill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's completely new and creative for me to be in a new company and be doing a new ballet. What more can I ask for? At Pact we always did repertoire ballets from overseas, and it's wonderful to be able to come here and do something that's fashioned on you. And Veronica (Paeper) is wonderful. She's a very easy person to work with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnny is also intrigued by the other original ballets in the Cape Town City Ballet's repertoire. He's looking forward to giving Orpheus a try, for one. Meanwhile, he'll be sharing the lead role in Manon with Johan Jooste and Hisham Omardien. And getting to know Cape Town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second member of the distinguished trio, Robin van Wyk, completed his ballet training at the UCT Ballet School and, after a short spell with Napac Dance Company, joined Pact in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his six years with Pact he has danced numerous leading roles and his dance experience has included musicals and extravaganzas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What prompted him to join the Cape Town City Ballet?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I guess it was the seven year itch. It was time for a change. I was getting stuck in a rut with the same roles and the same characters. I needed a change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's the first time I've worked with a choreographer who's choreographed a ballet on the company. At Pact we usually got a pre-packed deal, a choreologist just came in and taught the ballet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm enjoying Manon very much. I love watching it grow and change. It's also wonderful to do a new ballet - nobody can really afford new ballets these days. Manon is different, too, it's got a modern feel, it's not purely classical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His favourite ballets include La Syllphide, Still Life At Penguin Cafe and Romeo and Juliet - he'd love to dance Romeo one day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Robin's enjoying being back in Cape Town as a salaried employee rather than a student. While he says it's wonderful to be near the sea, he notices that the cost of living in Cape Town is higher than Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as dancing goes, he's happy and inspired &quot;to work with someone who choreographs her own work&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">David Krugel, the third member of the talented trio, is a dancer and choreographer who has run his own company and staged his own productions.  Formerly the artistic director of the Bop Dance Company, David moved to Cape Town last year, determined to make his way in this city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has founded his own company, the Batho Dance company, but is working towards starting a dance centre at his Mowbray premises, allowing for different teachers to give class on a rotational basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently he is teaching - when he's not rehearsing or performing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How did he find himself in Manon?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Veronica sprung it on me one day. It came out of the blue. At first I was blond, because I was going to be Carol Kinsey's partner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When principal dancer Kinsey was forced to retire due to injury, David went back to being a brunette.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Life was different as a blond,&quot; he notes. &quot;Blonde do have more fun ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he is quick to point out that right now he is having the time of his life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm having an absolutely great time. Veronica has left the roles quite free for us to interpret and I think mine is the nicest role in the whole ballet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He's also choreographing a piece for the Cape Town City Ballet's Baxter season in June. And if that's not enough, he's re-staging his piece, Concerto, for the company, choreographing the opera Sacred Bones and doing a piece for the UCT Ballet School - while still finding time to teach at his own studio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After June, he's hoping for an overseas trip to &quot;recharge my batteries and see what's going on&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before that, though, he'll go to the Grahamstown Festival with Sacred Bones.  He'd love to perform his own work there, but is doubtful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's almost too expensive for the performers to go there now ... It's ridiculous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Manon? &quot;It's an enormous task for Veronica. It's a difficult story to portray and it's up to the company to put that story over to the audience.  It's good for the company to portray personalities on stage.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town -The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) is to increase its number of staff so it can deal with the flood of cases that have come its way since it was launched last year to resolve labour disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has complained that the CCMA &quot;is drowning in a sea&quot; of cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosatu spokeswoman Nowethu Mpati said the CCMA was receiving close to 500 complaints a day. Most of them could have been resolved by employers and employees themselves, she added.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is so serious that the CCMA employees are apparently going to propose amendments to the Labour Relations Act and ask for the three-month time-frame within which to deal with each case to be extended to six months,&quot; Ms Mpati said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCMA director Charles Nupen denied this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Mpati said workers, especially those who were not unionised, &quot;run to the CCMA every time there is a problem at their workplace&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As Cosatu we want to encourage workers not to take each and every case they have to the CCMA. They must use bargaining forums at their workplaces to resolve such problems,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCMA was established under the Labour Relations Act and is charged with conciliating, mediating and, in some cases, arbitrating in labour disputes in the quickest possible time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nupen acknowledged that the commission had problems with the size of its caseload.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We obviously are experiencing difficulty dealing with the volume of cases coming to us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the governing body has approved a budget of R120 million for the 1997/1998 financial year and this will enable us to employ another 40 commissioners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CCMA has 80 full-time and 200 part-time commissioners on its staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are trying our best to deal with the workload and the 40 additional commissioners will be of some assistance in dealing with the volumes coming to us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Nupen said that in March the commission had received about 224 genuine complaints a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During November it received 834 cases and for the whole of March the number had more than tripled to 4 038 cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between November, when the CCMA was established, and March, the commission had received 14 000 complaints.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - In 1996, the first provincially set school-leaving examinations were written.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant that, for the first time, all the matric students from all the historically segregated education departments wrote the same exams, separated only on a provincial basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other words, for the first time the vast differences in educational provision became visible, and the reality of the effect of decades of educational oppression became clear to all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From October 1996 onwards, however, press releases on leak scandals took over from any kind of serious reporting on the examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Articles in the press with headings like &quot;exam paper syndicate&quot; were characterised by outrage and sensation, not by what the public has a right to expect - serious and constructive analysis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to point a finger only at the media, though - they report on what their public wants and there is certainly no tradition in South Africa of high quality feedback on public examinations, and thus no expectation of such.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, questions could legitimately be asked of educationists about their silence on these matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A recent nationally based press clippings survey conducted by the authors revealed, however, that press coverage of the school-leaving examinations left much to be desired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 96 articles surveyed in the period December 1995 to January 1997, only two were based on the views of an official examiner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers' views featured in only 23 percent of the articles, whereas 48 percent drew on information provided by spokesmen for the Department of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forty-five percent were classified by the researchers as &quot;sensation&quot; (exam leaks, evidence of cheating, marker strikes and so forth), while only 21 percent could be classified as &quot;stimulating debate&quot;, in other words, as containing more than one point of view, or presenting different arguments or theories.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, only 23 percent of the articles were classified as having a serious level of analysis, with 27 percent being extremely superficial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inevitably, this kind of coverage ignored the content-related issues of the examination system in favour of more saleable scandals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that appearance of the exam papers on the market, and related instances of corruption or incompetence, should not be of public concern, and roundly condemned - of course they should.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But such outrageous incidents could be used constructively if efforts were made to determine what exactly went wrong so that the mistakes were not repeated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact, it is now generally accepted that exam leaks have always taken place, particularly in the old Department of Education and Training system, and that at least this time corrective action is being taken publicly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is that sensationalising problems with the exam only adds to the general confusion accompanying the transformation of the educational system and feeds the distrust surrounding the integrity of the results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now that the transformation of the racially based departments into nine integrated provincial departments has taken place, and all matriculants have written the same exam in each province, we need to look at what the school- leaving examination really entails.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recent announcements on the introduction of &quot;Curriculum 2005&quot; highlight the need to develop ways of raising public awareness and improving debate about school-based issues as these are reflected in the examination system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What more do we know and understand of the school-leaving exam beside the facts that there were (yet again) leaks, and that the pass rate for the school-leaving certificate was about 52 percent?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do we know what skills were tested in the exam papers or how the exam papers were set?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Do we know whether candidates are becoming stronger or weaker in these skills - are there trends about which the public should know?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What do examiners have to say about the matriculation exams?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And what did teachers expect from Matric '96?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Are the exams simply a giant lottery, as DET students (and teachers) have long suspected, or is it possible to build public confidence through a careful campaign of public education - starting with the press?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are a number of compelling reasons for strengthening the school- leaving examination and restoring (or establishing) public confidence in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The school-leaving examination is a high stakes examination - by and large, it is what motivates pupils and parents to continue studying against sometimes great odds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although not always a reliable indicator of future educational success, at present the senior certificate is still the only realistic gateway to post- secondary education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also still a valued marker of achievement for employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The more the value of the certificate is devalued, however, the more likely it is that universities and technikons will begin to develop their own entrance testing schemes and that employers will lose confidence in the certificate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Removing the &quot;punch&quot; from the end-point of schooling through devaluing the examination would weaken its potential to improve the quality of education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If serious and skilled effort is put into it, the examination can be used very effectively to support and drive changes in the curriculum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While perhaps unpalatable, it is a truth nonetheless, that whatever the intrinsic worth of various curricular reforms, and however necessary these are, what the pupils' and the parents' gaze is on, is the examination occurring at the end of the curriculum, and not primarily the curriculum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of course, effort should be made to change this - in the meantime, however, it seems foolish in the extreme not to capitalise on this strength of examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, allowing the mass system of education to deliver less information than it could in terms of information about the skills and so forth of its learners, is to waste the taxpayers' money in a most profligate fashion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The development of expensive alternatives by universities and industry could be avoided to a large extent if the school-leaving examination itself regained credibility. And for a poor country like South Africa, every rand spent on education needs to be carefully justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For a better public understanding of the school-leaving examination, the public has to look to the press to provide a lead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports should be written (or commissioned) from a more expert perspective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Input from official examiners could form a crucial ingredient of a press release on examinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, teachers' and students' views should be more prominently used in any kind of feedback on the school-leaving examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers, particularly, have to be taken seriously as they are directly involved in classroom practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After all, it is teachers who form the direct link with matriculants in preparing them for the exams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ideally, good feedback on the management, content and significance of the matric exams would come from the new provincial examination panels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An example of a highly organised feedback mechanism on examinations comes from the Netherlands, where the department of education routinely produces documents in order to keep both the general public and the professional field informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such information (coming from the department that handles the examinations in all its aspects) allows for a high level of analysis in the Dutch press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result of this, the annual school-leaving exams are much more prominent and are followed by the general public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In South Africa, the new provincial examination panels are accountable to civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These panels should contribute to a better understanding of the school- leaving examinations, by making information around the setting of the examinations, for instance, available to the press and public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This kind of accountability has not been a feature of the examination system in South Africa and the press could play a valuable role in promoting its development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, developing a proper feedback mechanism is just one of the many tasks facing the Ministry of Education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problems in education are many and the road ahead will not be an easy one. But in the meantime, non-governmental structures of society - in which the press is a major player - can monitor the ministry's moves and report back to society in a constructive way.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Plans to revolutionise teaching will flop unless the Government solves many underlying problems, including big classes and high stress levels among teachers, Western Cape teachers and principals have warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were voicing growing concerns that Curriculum 2005, to be introduced in all South African schools, could be unworkable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new education system being phased in from next year is designed to abolish rote learning and encourage pupils to think for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will begin in Grade 1 (formerly Sub A) and Grade 7 (formerly Standard 5) next year, be extended to all levels by 2003 and fine-tuned by 2005. Western Cape teachers had their first briefings this week.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But senior educationists say Curriculum 2005 is bound to fail unless the Government deals with problems caused by rationalisation and redresses imbalances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say mounting frustration, big classes, high stress, over-hasty implementation of the system and lack of adequate information could undermine the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lincoln Mali, spokesman for the Education Ministry, said these concerns had been raised previously, but the department could not wait to resolve them before implementing the system, which was aimed at developing education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are working on the problems and we hope to find solutions,&quot; Mr Mali said. He denied the department was rushing the process. He said it was treating it &quot;cautiously and with the urgency it deserves&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But teachers are questioning whether the &quot;outcomes-based&quot; curriculum will work in South Africa, where circumstances differ from those in countries from which it has been copied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sea Point Primary School principal Philip Gurney, who visited New Zealand, where the system is used, cautioned that it should be handled with great care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New Zealand has a population of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3,5 million, a pupil-teacher ratio of one to 20, and highly qualified teachers,&quot; he said. South Africa had a much bigger population, language problems, limited resources, underqualified teachers and big classes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;How are we going to cope if we rush? There are still underlying problems of over-stressed teachers who have to cope with increasing workloads as a result of the teacher rationalisation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We and other schools expect to lose more teachers when phase two of the rationalisation process is implemented. I'm not sure if the curriculum could be implemented next year under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We like its superb ideals for the country, but the process needs to be slowed down. At least the Government needs to initiate pilot projects in all nine provinces and in different types of schools - rural, upmarket, and so on - to see how it will work,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His view was echoed by the acting principal of Maitland Secondary School, William Jantjies, who said the changes were being rushed and were &quot;bound to fail as long as the imbalances of the past are not redressed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Government should make money available to bring the historically disadvantaged schools and historically advantaged schools to the same level,&quot; said Mr Jantjies. &quot;Until the Government addresses those imbalances it will never move forward. A new class struggle will emerge and could plunge the country into revolution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many schools had to cope with gangsterism, big classes and few teachers, &quot; then on top of that burden is the new schools curriculum. Teachers are flocking to doctors' surgeries because of high stress levels. How do we implement the new curriculum when we have such problems?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Jantjies said he was behind the Government's plan to restructure education, but felt it should take more time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also complained about lack of information on the eight learning areas, which are to replace existing subjects. &quot;You don't know whether you'll have enough teachers to handle the eight learning areas,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michele Botha, acting principal of Ellerton Primary School in Sea Point, said the curriculum was balanced, but teachers did not have enough information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although most of the principals in black township schools were impressed with the curriculum, some said they did not have any information about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mongezi Memani of I D Mkize Secondary School in Guguletu said he would get clarity only when he attended one of the teacher information sessions being run by the Western Cape Education Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pan Africanist Student Organisation hit at the Government for trying to enforce the new curriculum while black schools were facing a crisis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Windhoek - The Government of Namibia has at last bowed to mounting pressure to use the T1-44 vaccine to combat the deadly cattle lung sickness prevalent in Namibia's northern areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet this week approved a recommendation by the Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Rural Development that &quot;a small number of cattle&quot; from the Northern Communal Areas affected by the deadly Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) be experimentally vaccinated with strain T1-44 vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was immediately hailed by farmers and veterinarians alike as the first step towards the total eradication of the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elaborating on its decision, Cabinet said: &quot;This will be done for the purpose of observing any possible adverse effects of the vaccine on the cattle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the vaccine is found to be safe, such treatment would be extended to all affected cattle in the Northern Communal Areas.&quot; Those approached for comment by The Namibian yesterday said the decision was long awaited and could only be to the benefit of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They noted that the vaccine had proved to be effective in many other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is produced by Onderstepoort Biological Products in South Africa and also at the Botswana Vaccine Institute (Rhone Poulenc) and has proved successful in countries like Kenya, Zambia, Tanzania and Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet confirmed that T1-44 had been recommended by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) and approved by the Pan-African Veterinary Vaccine Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The FAO recommendation was actually made as long ago as November 1995, but the Namibian Government ignored an offer made twice by the European Union to pay South Africa N$270 000 for the T1-44 vaccine and donate it to Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ministerial sources put the failure to obtain the vaccine down to a combination of &quot;bureaucratic delays and politics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccine used previously in Namibia had no positive impact and panic set in among farmers, especially in the North, because of the non-availability of an effective vaccine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cattle farmers north of the Veterinary Cordon Fence were gripped by fear as they were estimated to be losing more than N$14 million a year through cattle contracting the deadly disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the time they were pinning their hopes on the EU underwriting the purchase of the vaccine from South Africa for use in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year a 22,6 per cent prevalence of CBPP was detected in more than 27 000 cattle slaughtered at the Oshakati abattoir alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics graphically proved that the figure has risen sharply over the last few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the disease first started making itself felt in the country in 1991, only six clinical cases and eight deaths were confirmed, according to the 1991 Annual Namibia Stocks Census report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the same year, the number of localities where the disease was reported (FOCI) was five with a percentage of 3,4 in every 100 000 cattle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In stark contrast, in 1995 the disease had not only spread to 64 localities, but a higher percentage of 20,2 in every 100 000 cattle, was reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 1995 report said the &quot;disease has been spreading alarmingly in the northern regions of the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To add to the problems, it has been discovered that the Mycoplasma strain being used in most African vaccines - including the Namibian vaccine - is not suitable for vaccine purposes,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accordingly, the Directorate of Veterinary Services suspended annual CBPP vaccination campaigns in the North until a suitable replacement vaccine could be found, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bleaker picture emerged in December 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Namibia Stocks Census statistics pointed to 98 775 afflicted cattle in Okavango, 154 926 in Kaokoland, 2 500 in Sesfontein and 476 658 in the former Owambo area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, the total number of cattle in the affected areas amounts to 732 859 and with a 22,6 per cent prevalence of the disease points to 165 626 infected cattle.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">COTONOU, Benin (PANA) - Guinea-Bissau was officially admitted as a member of the CFA Franc Zone at a two-day meeting of the Council of Ministers of Finance of France and French-speaking African countries which ended on Thursday in Cotonou, Benin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Minister of Finance, Jean Arthuis, and the Guinea-Bissau delegation signed the additional clause to the existing agreement enabling France to extend its monetary co-operation with the West African Economic and Monetary Union to Bissau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As from May 2, the CFA Franc is expected to replace the Peso as the official currency of Guinea-Bissau, according to a statement issued at the end of the meeting.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Governor of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), Charles Konan Banny, said Guinea-Bissau's transition to the CFA Franc zone involved &quot; a heavy financial transaction&quot; necessitating the injection of some 6 billion CFA Francs (about 12 million U.S. dollars into the country's economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guinea-Bissau has therefore become the 15th member of the Franc Zone which already comprises Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, the statement said &quot;the replacement of the French franc by the Euro (the European single currency) in 1999 will not affect the exchange rate of the CFA franc and the existing monetary co-operation between France and the African member countries of the Franc Zone&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French franc has been linked to the CFA (African Finance Community) used by the African countries at a fixed exchange rate which now stands at 100 CFA for one French franc after the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50 percent at a high-level meeting held in Dakar (Senegal) in January 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Previously the exchange rate was 50 CFA = 1FF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French Minister told reporters in Cotonou that &quot;the Euro will be a world-wide reserve currency against which the value of the CFA Franc will be determined&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the statement, the ministers of finance of the Franc Zone expressed satisfaction at the progressive economic growth rate recorded in the UEMOA countries (around 5 percent) and at similar developments in the member States of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a Declaration adopted at the end of their meeting, the ministers called for increased private investment in the countries of the Franc Zone in order to maintain high growth on a long-term basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Declaration, the commitments made by the Governments, particularly in their structural adjustment programmes, are aimed at &quot; fostering a more stable macro-economic environment&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among other things, the ministers recommended the harmonization of budgetary and monetary policies, taxation and customs services in a regional framework as well as increased consultation with the private sector on matters concerning the formulation of economic policies&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Declaration further stressed the need for security of investment, improved infrastructures and state disengagement from productive sectors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda (PANA) - Uganda has earned a record of 60.32 million U.S dollars from gold exports between the second half of 1996 to date, according to the Bank of Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the earnings from gold exports began rising in the 1994/95 financial year during which gold worth 12.44 million dollars was exported, a substantial increase from less than one million dollars in the 1993/94 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The exports then tripled to 35.15 million dollars in the 1995/96 after which they hit a record of 60.32 million dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 72-percent increase in gold earnings only compares with a slightly higher increase of proceeds from cotton, which brought in 23.8 million dollars, 80 percent higher than the 13.26 million dollars realized in the 1995/96 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A banker who monitors commodities at the Central Bank said some of the gold could be &quot;leakages&quot; into Uganda from neighbouring Zaire, where normal trading in minerals has been disrupted by civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the rise in cotton exports could also be explained by the fact that the Ugandan cotton which used to be smuggled to Sudan and Zaire was now being sold in the home market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rise in gold exports contrasts sharply with export earnings of Uganda's foremost foreign exchange earner -- coffee, which continues to nose dive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While coffee fetched 456.6 million dollars in the 1994/95 financial year, 404.3 million dollars was earned in 1995/96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further slump this year is expected with a projected income from the commodity being at a low of 331.07 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cereals, whose biggest volume exported was maize, accounts for 75 percent increase this financial year and is expected to fetch 12.59 million dollars, up from 9.43 million dollars 1995/96 financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a sharp decline in cereal exports was observed, from 109.5 million tons in the 1994/95 to 59.06 million tons in the last financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year a total 67.08 million tons has been sold, a result likely to reflect the effect of the 1996 famine in many parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Bank, over all merchandise exports have increased effective from the 1994/95 financial year but have since stabilized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uganda exported merchandise worth 595.26 million US dollars two years ago and 590.53 million US dollars last year. The projection for his year is 588.  38 by the end of June.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe's former President, Canaan Banana, was the notable absentee from Friday's celebrations marking the country's 17th independence celebrations in Harare, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior government official told the national news agency, Ziana, that Banana, currently under investigation by police for homosexual rape of his ex- aide-de camp, was not invited to the event at Harare's national sports stadium.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official declined to give reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana, as the country's first post-independence president, was conspicuous by his absence from such a high profile state occasion, and if invited, he could have been accorded VIP status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former president's alleged homosexual rape of Jefta Dube was revealed in the High Court last February when the former ADC was convicted of the murder of a former police constable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dube's defence was that he was not responsible for his actions because of the trauma arising from repeated sexual abuse by the former president at State House in Harare between 1983 and 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argued that he shot the fellow policeman at a musical concert at Gwanzura stadium in Harare after he had insulted him by calling him Banana's wife.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The alleged sodomy by the international statesman who became Zimbabwe's first black president at independence in 1980 attracted increased attention to this conservative Southern African nation, whose President, Robert Mugabe has verbally attacked homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Banana, married with four children is a theology professor at the University of Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He retired in 1987 to make way for Mugabe following the introduction of the executive presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe who is unpopular among the homosexual community for his scathing attacks on the practice is being watched at home and abroad if he will live up to this word that Zimbabwe would not tolerate any homosexuality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, in celebrating the country's 17th independence anniversary, painted a picture of significant economic growth and increased employment, factors he attributed to two consecutive good rain seasons and some sound government measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe, in a speech he read at the National Sports Stadium in Harare and also read on his behalf in the country's provincial gatherings, said Zimbabwe's economy was expected to grow by at least 5 percent, lower than last year's 8 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, with a population of 11.5 million, has a 45 percent unemployment rate. So, the bulk of the populace is struggling to meet basic needs after suffering negative effects of western-backed economic reforms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said a policy to cushion the nation against the effects of drought was being developed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Performance of the agricultural sector, he said, would be stimulated as a 25 year policy framework was now in place to chart the growth, taking into account the country's population growth rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This (agricultural policy) will also benefit from the development of a policy on drought management that treats drought not as an exogenous shock, but as a predictable phenomenon that must feature permanently in policy making and the resource allocation process,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the country's worst consecutive droughts of the early 1990s, several social and economic development projects, such as economic reforms, were derailed as the government was caught unprepared with no contingency measure to mitigate the effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mugabe said in 1996 the manufacturing sector had grown by about 3.5 percent while the mining sector was negatively affected by low international prices for major minerals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said gold production for 1996 was marginally higher at 24.72 tons compared to 24.24 tons recorded in 1995. The country had earned 6.1 billion zimdollars (0.55 billion U.S. dollars) from mineral production. This was largely due to the depreciation of the Zimbabwean dollar against the basket of major currencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prospects in this sector were bright, he said, as there were 235 current Exclusive Prospecting Orders and some 215 applications which had been processed by the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;New gold deposits have been found in the Kwekwe area, while new platinum deposits were also found at Unki and Ngezi,&quot; said Mugabe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mining sector also accounted for 34.4 percent of the 10.2 billion zimdollar (0.92 billion U.S. dollar) worth of 415 projects approved by the Zimbabwe Investment Center, in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected, he added, that these projects would generate 12,147 jobs annually for five years, and export earnings of some 2.264 billion zimdollars (0.205 billion U.S. dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Export processing Zone scheme attracted 26 projects valued at 2.5 billion zimdollars (0.22 billion U.S. dollars)and some 2,684 jobs were expected to be created.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional 2,208 jobs had been created from the 652 projects approved by the Small Enterprises Development Corporation, or Sedco, which was recapitalized in 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pilot micro-finance scheme benefited five hundred groups in the informal sector,&quot; he said. This included 1,305 women and created 3,586 jobs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The Uganda People's Defence Force says it has killed 60 Sudanese soldiers and captured 114 in a pre-emptive strike in which several rebels were also killed at Lelabur, just inside Uganda's border with Sudan. &quot;The captives are in custody of the Fourth Division in northern Uganda, &quot; said Amama Mbabazi, the Ugandan state minister for defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing him Thursday, the government-owned newspaper, New Vision, reported Friday that 68 members of the Lords Resistance Army, an anti-government religious outfit headed by Joseph Kony, were killed and 50 others either captured or surrendered.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbabazi refuted claims by Sudan on Thursday that 306 Ugandan troops, including the second in command of the army's Fourth Division, Lt. Col.  Nakibus Lakara, had been killed Tuesday in a battle 44 miles south of Juba.  Mbabazi said Lakara was alive and still in northern Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that two Ugandan soldiers of junior rank, attached to a small special operations unit which has been gathering intelligence information about Kony rebels, had gone missing in action in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbabazi said that on Monday the Ugandan army attacked a combined force of about two companies of Sudanese forces and two companies of Kony rebels near Lelabur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UPDF also captured an assortment of weapons. This combined force had intention of establishing a base in Gulu or Kitgum for purpose of carrying out intelligence work in preparation for an offensive by the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Kony bandits in northern Uganda,&quot; Mbabazi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These two towns are inside Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the full names and particulars of the Sudanese captives will be made public &quot;in due course.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbabazi, talking to the newspaper later, said Uganda's interest in Sudan was only in intelligence gathering. He declined to give particulars of the two Ugandan soldiers reported missing in action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan's Radio Omdurman, quoting a military communique, reported Thursday that the Ugandan attack was an attempt to reach Juba, from the eastern side of the Nile after failing to attack the town from the west. When Sudan reported that the second in command in of Uganda's Fourth Infantry Division had died, it failed to give his name and rank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the Sudanese Army General Command said it would display its evidence to the public at the earliest possible time to prove that the &quot; attacking troops were Ugandan and that they came from Gulu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan claimed that the anti-Khartoum government guerrillas, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, was not involved in the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Uganda's Senior Presidential Advisor on Media and Public Relations, John Nagenda, dismissed the Sudanese claims. He said that the Sudanese should show the press the bodies of the Ugandan soldiers allegedly killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commander Pierre of the SPLA, talking to The New Vision from Nairobi, Kenya, said the claims by the Khartoum regime were false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPLA has scored a string of military successes over the last three to four weeks. They are fighting for autonomy and against attempts by the central government to Arabize and Islamize the Christian southerners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Funky Cape-based clothing retailer LA Retail Stores sees big growth in branded clothing products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have seen a huge surge in demand for branded products,&quot; LA Retail chairman AK Peer said at the release of the company's interim results for the six months to February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Branded products will dominate the future of apparel in the South African retail industry, and we are poised to harness this growth.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA Retail's commitment to the branded apparel market was crystallised in its R115-million purchase of Skye Products last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skye Products is the country's largest marketer and distributor of national branded apparel and footwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peer said he believed the acquisition would significantly enhance the group's growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are confident that Skye's proven management and branded products will support our growth strategy,&quot; Mr Peer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LA Retail has already successfully placed its own &quot;LA&quot; brand on the map among the fashion conscious teen and young adult market, and is now reviving the Samson brand of workwear which was previously owned by Ensign Clothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peer said the group was also investigating a new retail concept which he believed would capture a growing market in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was unwilling to expand on what this &quot;new concept&quot; would be, but said it would be as significant as the acquisition of Skye Products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is sure to capture the approval of shareholders of LA Retail who have just seen their company notch up half-year net profits of R2,3 million, putting the company firmly on track to beat its forecast</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R4,1 million for the full year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peer said that the group expected a higher turnover and operating profit during the next six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was due to the higher price and margins on winter wear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the winter period our higher value items, such as jeans and footwear, do particularly well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Peer also said the group's listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange last year had put its expansion programme on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four of the six proposed new stores were already operating successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our flagship store opened in Pretoria late last year and has met with overwhelming support from local shoppers,&quot; Mr Peer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All four of the new stores have exceeded their profit targets and we are confident that our new and existing stores will help the group to comfortably reach its forecast earnings for the year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the group would be opening its first store in KwaZulu/Natal next month, to be followed soon after that by another store in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The battle rages on over the R247-million deficit provincial budget tabled by finance MEC Kobus Meiring, with the Democratic Party and the African National Congress digging in their heels in a tense standoff with the ruling National Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial DP joined the ANC in vowing to vote against the deficit budget when it came up for adoption in the provincial legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DP provincial leader Hennie Bester said his party would oppose the adoption of the budget as Mr Meiring could not give any explanations as to how he would cover the R247-million shortfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial ANC has declared it will vote against the R247-million deficit. The provincial budget is being debated in the legislature.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Bester blamed both the NP and the central government for the crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The answer to cuts in national funds cannot be to cut services, but to find new ways of doing things,&quot; Mr Bester said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tasneem Essop, the ANC's shadow finance MEC, said that, at the least, the party wanted the budget vote to be postponed to rework the budget to the deficit and change priorities away from administration and salaries to social services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring's budget slashed education, health, social services and housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The largest amount of the R9,5-billion provincial expenses in his budget - 73 percent - went to personnel and administration, which included salaries, costing more than R6-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring said he was banking on central government to bail out the province. Did not central government come to the rescue of the Western Cape in the previous two budgets?.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has told him that this time, with the central government's new commitment to fiscal discipline, there is no way in which it will come to the rescue of the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only route now for Premier Hernus Kriel and the NP is to railroad the budget through the provincial legislature, crushing objections from the DP and ANC in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial budget was bound to say as much about the politics in the province as about its fiscus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring took the rare step of budgeting for a deficit, in a blunt signal that the NP-ruled provincial government felt it had been punished by the central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever the arguments, there is little doubt that the ordinary person in the Western Cape will be hit by the budget. There will be fewer hospital beds for the sick, less equipment for schoolchildren, who will have to be in bigger classes, and even an end to the transport subsidy to bring rural pupils from outlying areas to schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Twine, a senior economist at Econometrix, laconically remarked that, given the consummate ease with which Mr Meiring had &quot;balanced&quot; his 1997/98 budget, no politician ever again had to wrestle over niceties such as whether budgeted expenses was covered by budgeted income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The solution according to Mr Meiring and company, said Mr Twine, was so simple that it was a wonder that budgetary deficits had been such a problem between the United States Republicans and Democrats for all these years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem is thus, argued Mr Twine: South Africa has one central government with nine second-tier provincial governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven of the nine have ANC majorities in their legislatures - the Western Cape has a National Party majority while Inkatha rules KwaZulu Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Together with Gauteng, the industrial hub of the nation, the two account for more than two thirds of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape contributed about 16,7 percent of GDP and Gauteng 49,3 percent. The two provinces' share of the national budget amounted to only 5,6 percent and 8,3 percent, respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way the central government allocates its block payments to each of the provinces is by the financial and fiscal commission. The commission is an independent body which checks funds are distributed equally among provinces, taking into account population and historical imbalances among other criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission's ultimate aim, in six years' time, is to spread the budget equally among the different provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Each province presents its spending requirements to the commission, and these are panelbeaten into shares of the total available from the national budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provinces then have to rework their spending priorities in the light of having less income than they might have initially budgeted for. That is exactly what happened to the provinces for the 1997/ '98 fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using the FFC formula, the Western Cape share of the national budget increased in nominal terms from roughly R8,37-billion in 1996/'97 to R8,75- billion in the 1997/'98 budget. Measured in terms of allocation per person, the Western Cape received the second-largest share of the national budget, at R2 197 a person, even higher than Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Western Cape average was only exceeded by the Northern Cape. The average allocation a person for all the provinces was R1 755.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Mr Meiring worked out his provincial budget, he found out the Western Cape had about R780-million less income than it had originally planned for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring then went back to the drawing board - 10 times - and reworked the budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He cut down more on his expenses - and came up with a budget that squeezed out savings of about R620-million, or a net R540-million after the adjustment for pensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He calculated that provincial income of R502-million would be boosted by the R90-million charge to other provinces for cross-border services and the 10 percent increase in motor vehicle licences from June 1, which would generate R217,4-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An additional R86-milion would come from hospital fees, R26-million from horse racing and R19-million from last year's surplus. Savings of R620- million would come from cutting the education budget by R347-million, health by R255-million, agriculture R23-million, and housing, local government and planning by R9,6-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Assistance to local authorities was cut by R40-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The savings was offset by the net R80-million increase in the social services budget to give net savings of R540-million. Still, it was about R240- million off the mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem, said Mr Twine, was that second-tier provincial governments, as well as third-tier local governments, were not supposed to run budgetary deficits on current expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provincial Borrowing Act restricts the financing of capital projects under the stern proviso that the means of repayment must be clearly spelled out when any borrowing is undertaken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring has complained, justly so, that the national government has made no provision for the provinces to boost their own income by raising taxes paid to them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such measures should have been implemented already, according to the interim constitution, but will not nowcome into effect before January 1 1998.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister Trevor Manuel can help a lot by ensuring that plans for provincial revenue generation are speeded up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the moment, provinces are highly restricted in terms of raising their own domestic revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motor vehicle licence fees, hospital fees, entertainment and gambling taxes, as well as cross-border charges rendered to provinces, make up a rather scanty list of potential sources of income apart from central government funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the case of the Western Cape, 91 percent of the 1997/'98 revenue will come from the central government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC said the provincial belt could be tightened further than Mr Meiring's efforts so far to produce savings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, there were funds for 2 901 public service posts which had not been filled. Why, asked Ms Essop, should Premier Kriel have to increase his office budget by R13-million, as the office of the premier was a non-delivery department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Meiring said in a budget speech the money would be used to help Mr Kriel get closer to his electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Essop suggested R12-milion be skimmed off the R16-million increase in the budget of the province's environmental and cultural affairs department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC said this department should look at rearranging its priorities in line with delivery needs, especially those of disadvantaged communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It proposed the Provincial Public Service Commission's budget of R6-million be reduced by R2-million, as the commission was to be phased out at the end of this year and did not need a big budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Essop revealed the provincial government had spent close to R3-million on an investigation into provincial budget cuts in the 1996/'97 budget and beyond. This probe, called the Special Investigation Cabinet Assignment, was a waste of money, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DP's Richard van der Ross summed up the crisis over the provincial budget: &quot;They (NP) are playing a power game to show their supporters how smart they are in shooting down the other side, so that people will vote for them next time around.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - How do foreign visitors rate Cape Town's rag-tag fleet of sedan taxis, their drivers and the fares they charge?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not very highly, according to a survey of 60 tourists from overseas, half of whom said they had had problems ranging from overcharging to simply not being able to find taxis when they needed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an attempt to find out what sort of service taxi companies and drivers offer visitors, I armed myself with a rucksack and a phoney German accent and took to the tourist routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the first things I discovered was that taxi drivers seem easily duped. As many as five fell for the accent which I believed would not fool anyone. Not even my obvious questions and feverish note-taking alerted them to the fact that they might not be dealing with a well-heeled German tourist.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My first stop was the Plein Street taxi rank next to the Grand Parade where I timidly approached a Magicab Radio Taxi driver and asked to be taken to &quot;ze&quot; Bay Hotel in Camps Bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was told it would cost me &quot;thirty-something&quot;rands but that the price would be determined by the meter. The car was neat, but very old, the driver casually dressed and, at first, not very talkative or friendly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But my inquiry about good shopping venues in the city sparked his interest.  He assured me N1 City or Cavendish Square would be my best bets and strongly advised against the Waterfront because it was &quot;too expensive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He started warning me about unscrupulous taxi drivers who were giving the industry a bad name but in the same breath offered to take me to places of scenic interest for a &quot;special price&quot; in his own car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a short trip such as from my hotel to the Waterfront, this could save me R10, while I would pay R150 less for a trip to Cape Point or Stellenbosch which normally cost around R400, he said. (A bus trip to Cape Point or Stellenbosch costs between R145 and R185, including entrance fees, leaving at 8.30am and returning at 5.30pm.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I paid R35 for the trip along Plein Street and over Kloofnek although the meter reading was closer to R31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On formal inquiry to the Magicab office later, I was told a trip from Plein Street to the Waterfront cost R50 and to Cape Point in the region of R350.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My rating for this company is &quot;fair&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My next trip was with a Marine taxi from the Bay Hotel to Captour's offices in Adderley street, roughly the same distance as the first trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After waiting for 25 minutes, a very polite and neatly dressed driver collected me, opening the passenger door and apologising for the delay. The car was clean and in a very good condition. I was told that the trip would cost me in the region of R50. When asked if I would prefer the scenic or mountain route, I played dumb, asking for whichever would be the quickest. He assured me the distance was exactly the same. Naturally, we took the scenic route.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Again I was advised not to go near the Waterfront. &quot;You won't find what you are looking for there, it is very touristy.&quot; His recommendation for shopping was Tyger Valley. The trip would cost me R150.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His tariff to Cape Point was R850, but for me he would make a special price of R600.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After assuring me that crime was no longer a problem in the city, the talkative driver proceeded to tell me he never travelled without a gun, had been involved in seven shoot-outs with criminals and had survived as a taxi driver for so long only because of his combat training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But that's part of life here,&quot; he tried to reassure me, warning me not to walk around alone at night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the Marine Taxis office told me a trip from the Bay Hotel to Adderley Street cost R55 and he estimated a trip to Cape Point at R750.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This company deserves no more than a &quot;fair&quot; rating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From Captour, I went to the Waterfront in a Waterfront bus at a cost of R1, 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A taxi ride over a similar distance, from the Victoria and Alfred Hotel to the Cape Sun Hotel, cost me R14 in a run-down, rusty old car. The driver, dressed in jeans, T-shirt and cap ,was not in the mood for conversation, apart from advising me to steer clear of the Waterfront.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We travelled along Coen Steytler Avenue, around both circles in Adderley Street and right into Strand Street to the hotel. When I wanted to pay, he had no change for a R50 and could offer no alternative. I eventually &quot;found&quot; the right amount in my purse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No company name was displayed on the side of the car and the driver refused to give me a card or telephone number.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturally, I have to rate this taxi as &quot;poor&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next expedition was from the Peninsula Hotel in Sea Point to Cape Town International Airport on a Saturday night with my German husband in an attempt to make my performance more credible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For this trip the Intercape airport shuttle charges R30 a person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Sea Point Taxis driver arrived within two minutes of my call and we were greeted by a friendly, elderly woman in a white uniform in a neat, clearly marked car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the trip would cost us about R90. Her rate to Cape Point was R500, but she recommended we rather take a bus because it would be cheaper and more enjoyable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She chatted all the way to the airport, answering all our questions and doing her best to promote the city and the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Waterfront is really a blessing because you can go there any time, even at night and when the weather is bad,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime in Cape Town simply was not a problem, except in the townships where people still killed one another, she assured us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The best place for shopping in town was the Green Point flea market where you found the best bargains but the Waterfront also offered a good selection of shops, she told us. She advised us not to use minibus taxis &quot;unless you are really desperate&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trip cost R106 but she asked if she could make out the receipt for R110, to which which my husband agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My official inquiry to Sea Point Taxis owner Ernest MacDonald confirmed the rate to the airport as between R110 and R120 and to Cape Point as about R500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We both agreed this company's performance was &quot;very good&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the airport we flagged down another taxi to get back to the Peninsula Hotel and to our surprise the driver was also a woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No name was displayed on the side of the car but we were told the company was called J S taxis. The driver, dressed in a casual track suit, told us the trip would be between R120 and R130.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her rate to Cape Point was R600, but she advised us not to take a taxi but a bus or a rented car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her recommendations for shopping included the Green Point flea market and Tyger Valley centre. She said the Waterfront was expensive for shopping, but the restaurants were quite reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime was not a problem, apart from pickpockets &quot;who are among the best in the world&quot;, she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She warned us against unscrupulous taxi operators, adding that her own boss would rather drive a long route to try to make more money out of tourists.  Other drivers would activate their meters from the time they received a call and, in one instance she knew of, a driver charged a couple R150 from the airport to Bellville, which should cost no more than R50.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I don't believe in cheating people,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We paid R150 for the trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I could find no trace of JS Taxis in the telephone directory and nor could Telkom's directory inquiry service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My rating for this company's service is &quot;fair&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although most drivers appeared helpful and friendly, my experiences clearly illustrate the need for training, standardisation of rates and services and proper control over the industry from the authorities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Educators have warned that the introduction of the revolutionary &quot;curriculum 2005&quot; next year is destined to fail unless the government solves the underlying problems in education</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When teachers and school principals express concerns about the haste with which the far-reaching changes to the school curriculum are to be introduced from next year it is time to sit up and take notice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They fear the new system is destined to fail unless the many underlying problems already heaped against education are solved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teachers with expertise and a commitment to making the curriculum work are vital but in the Western Cape alone some 6 000 of the most qualified educators have been lost to the profession by the teacher rationalisation programme which even the Minister of Education has admitted contained serious flaws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there are other problems: mounting frustration among teachers; large classes; the loss of more teachers when phase two of rationalisation begins; high stress levels - none of which are conducive to what should be an exciting phase in the evolution of South African education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Teaching children to think for themselves instead of learning by rote is an admirable ideal which should be welcomed enthusiastically by parents, educators and future employers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the system becomes vulnerable when the teacher-pupil ratios soar and teachers' experience and qualifications are not up to standard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is evident these problems cannot be achieved quickly. Surely it is a matter of great enough importance to deserve a series of pilot projects to evaluate its merit in the South African situation at this time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not unreasonably, educators have called for the process to be handled with great care. This sentiment will be shared by all who have the interests of the country's future - our children - at heart.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Imagine being asked to submit with your university application a full-length photograph of yourself in a swimming costume.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This bizarre request by the University of Cape Town's physiotherapy department 25 years ago irrevocably changed the course of Human Rights Commissioner Rhoda Kadalie's life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So outraged was she that she defied the coloured elite's advocation of entering formerly all-white tertiary institutions and under protest went to the then-unfashionable &quot;bush&quot; University of the Western Cape (UWC), where the white Afrikaans-speaking lecturers unashamedly fed black students apartheid propaganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically it was here that the obedient daughter of a lay minister was transformed into a strident voice for the oppressed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Time spent with the outspoken Rhoda can be an empowering experience. Petite and businesslike, she has gained many supporters. But her refusal to show reverence to authority has irked many people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am too honest for my own good and I have often got into trouble, but I don't regret it. My driving force is justice. If something is just and true, I will fight for it. I will not say the politically correct thing,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The granddaughter of trade unionist Clements Kadalie who was instrumental in launching the first black trade union in 1908, Rhoda was born in District Six in 1953.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her father Fenner worked for the city council as a clerk and in reaction to the frequent absence of Clements during his childhood, eschewed politics to become a missionary. As a result, she had a strong Calvinistic upbringing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For 16 years the only girl among seven boisterous boys - her parents kept trying until they had another daughter - she was the apple of her father's eye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always had to assert myself in a male household. But I was never led to believe I was inferior or secondary to men,&quot; she said. &quot;We could speak openly at home and early on we began to question taboos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoda describes herself as an intellectual Christian who had to discover God for herself. &quot;I think the way the church often depicts God - as male and white - is blasphemous. God doesn't identify with patriarchy or sexual violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She became politically inclined and rebelled against typically feminine career choices, choosing library science and gaining a four-year degree with honours in anthropology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She became a junior lecturer in anthropology in the late 70s and her rebellion continued. &quot;I was subversive and quite radical politically. I got the students to do innovative projects like interviewing political detainees.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoda became intensely involved with the United Democratic Front at a time when the Black Consciousness Movement was strong. Simultaneously she became aware of the extent of sexual harassment. On campus the struggle against apartheid gained momentum but no such fight was being waged against gender inequality. So she took up the cudgels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoda became a campaigner for women's equality for academic, administrative and general staff alike on campus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What I did at UWC was to watch the men in power and use the same ploys they did, to subvert and undermine their authority. But at the same time I provided them with the facts that proved injustices existed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What angered her later was that on occasion some male professors would ask her to bring up an issue they wanted aired as they did not have the courage to do so themselves. She despised this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The very men who didn't like me for my feminism used me for my courage,&quot; she said. &quot;A lot of men are crippled by ambition. They won't rock the boat for fear of jeopardising their career. I don't give a shit about rising to the top. My driving concern is the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoda co-ordinated UWC's gender equity office from 1993 to 1995. Many people around her felt that their cause was at last being taken seriously and she won strong support from the staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She married a fellow lecturer, with whom she had a daughter, before they later divorced. Because the Immorality Act decreed she could not marry across the colour line the couple skipped to Namibia for the wedding .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We bought a house in Observatory and before we moved in we introduced ourselves to our (white) neighbours. One of them said: 'Don't worry - your neighbours are either drunkards or dykes. You'll just fit in,'&quot; she burst out laughing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of her appointment in October 1995 was perfect: &quot;I always said when I turned 40 I wanted a new career. But I was very surprised to get this position.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhoda was the successful candidate out of 83 nominees for the position of human rights commissioner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My work at UWC trained me to be analytical and critical. It inculcated in me a fearlessness in campaigning around issues. I have never been a political lackey and because of this was not always liked. Yet I think the qualifying factor for my appointment was my independence,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - Poor service from many sedan taxi operators in Cape Town is harming the city's image among foreign visitors, who say this international mode of transport is often not up to scratch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is according to a report on a service measurement pilot project undertaken for the Cape Town municipality as part of an initiative to jack up service in the tourism industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The project identifies an urgent need for corrective and preventive measures to close the &quot;service gaps&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixty foreign visitors from more than 10 countries were asked about their experiences in metered taxis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Half said they had had service-related problems, ranging from attempts to overcharge, deliberately taking people to the wrong addresses and unnecessary detours, to difficulty hiring taxis from certain places and having to make use of &quot;pirate&quot; (illegal) taxis. Eight percent of participants would not advise others to use sedan taxis in Cape Town because of dissatisfaction with the service or prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The visitors interviewed had, on average, made more than four trips by metered taxi in the city and some had made as many as 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The average participant spent about R3 000 on accommodation, meals, tours, transport, entertainment, shopping and sundry expenses during his or her stay, and some spent as much as R8 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 50 percent were professionals, many in management positions.  Older visitors and younger women are two important groups who used taxis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stresses the &quot;increasingly important role of meter taxis&quot; as traffic flows in the inter city increased and streets get more congested during the Olympics, if Cape Town hosts the 2004 Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metered taxis form a vital part of inner-city transportation networks world- wide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are believed to be about 400 sedan taxis in Cape Town, many of which operate illegally. In many instances poor service is the result of &quot;deep- seated economic problems&quot;, increasing competition from tour buses and problems arising from illegal operators, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is further compounded by low morale, lack of skills and poor communication with other tourism industries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - The unemployment crisis had compelled the Government to adopt a much tougher approach to admission of foreign workers, Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi told the National Assembly yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a debate on the Home Affairs budget vote, Chief Buthelezi said this had resulted in the Aliens Control Amendment Act, which stipulated that work, study and work-seeker's permits must be applied for from abroad (not after arrival in SA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These more stringent control measures have had an overwhelmingly positive effect, as foreigners who previously entered South Africa on holiday permits with the intention of seeking employment are now compelled to obtain work permits before entering South Africa and employment opportunities are, therefore, better secured for local residents,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he was committed to apprehending and removing illegals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The illegal alien population in South Africa, estimated between 2,5 million and 5 million, had put socio-economic resources under severe strain. He estimated illegal aliens cost the Government billions of rnds annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cabinet had appealed through the media to foreign companies operating in South Africa to demonstrate support for the RDP by refraining from appointing alien employees to positions which could be filled by South African citizens or permanent residents, unless this was absolutely necessary, Chief Buthelezi told the assembly.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA (ENA) - Alleged Red Terror perpetrators whom the Special Prosecutor accused of torturing and murdering people tagged as &quot;anti- revolutionary and anti-people EPRP members&quot; in Woreda 9 and 13 of the capital yesterday appeared at the Federal High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the charge levelled against 49 defendants including Kelbesa Negewo, the then chairman of both Woreda Nine Administration and the Revolutionary Campaign coordinating Committee who is being tried in abesnita, says the alleged culprits had tortured and killed people involved in a certain political circle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge says the defendants are responsible for the killing of many people through &quot;Zemecha Mentir&quot;, &quot;Netsa Ermija&quot; and the Red Terror. A girl who lived in Woreda 9 Kebele 09 was shot to death on 19 December 1977 and laid by a roadside, according to the charge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also says Kelbesa Negewo and Woizero Simret Biru, then secretary of the Woreda 9 Kebele 10 administration and member of the Revolutionary Campaign coordinating Committee, with their accomplices had been shooting many people to death usually at midnights around the Muslims' Cemetery, Shola, Kelemework School, St. John church and other places.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge contains lists of names who, it says, are suffering from illnesses caused by brutal torture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the charge, Kelbesa Negewo and his accomplies who are made responsible for 64 different charges; had allegedly committed extrajudical arrests ranging from three days to three years, besides searching the houses of two deceased people without court order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants are also accused of taking cars, money, gold, books and video cassettes from people whom they intimidated, the charge elaborates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Zenebe Ayele, chairman of the Revolutionary Campaign Committee of Woreda 13 from 1969 - 1977, and 72 collaborators are responsible for the death, physical injury and detention with the intent to cause death on people in the woreda, the charge file stated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citing a specific incident, the file alleged that the accused has shot to death 13 individuals whom they detained in different areas of Addis Ababa in December 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a similar summary execution prepared in February 1978, the chairman and his collaborators have gunned down 12 individuals near the Menlik Hospital and in Kebele 06 of the woreda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A persecution witness told the court that a third year student of the Addis Abab University named Senay was burnt to death following the inhuman torture and beating in a Kebele of woreda 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The witness said five people were killed on March 6, 1978 (5:00 A.M. local time), with two of them at Ras Mekonen Bridge, the other one near Nazareth School and the rest near Yekatit 12 Hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charge levelled by the Special Prosecutor says the Woreda 13 defendants allegedly committed crimes against innocent citizens including burning and torturing which resulted in internal and external bodily harms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defendants of the two woredas appealed tot he court they can not afford to hire defence lawyers and the court ordered them to produce letter of justification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police were also ordered to search for others who are at large and bring them before the court of law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA - The coordinating committee on the reorganization of the Confederation of Ethiopian Trade Unions (CETU) announced here yesterday that it has completed preparations to hold its eighth general assembly, reportedly scheduled to be conducted during 22-24 April 1997 at the assembly hall of the Ethiopian Roads Authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive committee members - Ato Aregawi Kebede, Ato Zenebe Kebede and Ato Yemane Binega - gave a briefing to local newsmen that the meeting is expected to discuss at length the newly draft regulations and structural contents of CETU as well as elect new leaders and audit committee members.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee noted that the dissolution of the former CETU was the result of lack of requisite provisions in the statute. the restructured confederation is expected to be national in form and the content would be democratic institutions which passes decisions not on individuals but popular basis, they added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizing committee, which is drawn from among eight trade union federations and comprising of 16 members, has been conducting various meetings on revising status of the former CETU with basic trade unions in Addis Ababa and the various other regions which more or less unanimously voted in favour, it was disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee meanwhile noted that members of the Construction and business Bank and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia said to await court decision on whether the former CETU was illegal and thus deserved tocontinue representing the country's organised labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is to be recalled that CETU was established formerly, in 1986 (E.C) but denied legal status due to conflict of interest among the top leadership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington - African sustainable development efforts will be greatly affected by decisions on the foreign assistance budget now scheduled for April 23, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House International Relations Committee chairman Ben Gilman is proposing $18.8 billion for the overall Fiscal Year (FY) 1998 international affairs budget, which is $500 million above the FY97 level but $700 million below the President's current request. Despite a potential increase, Gilman is proposing to cut bilateral development assistance programs by a total of $180 million below the FY97 level.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the past two years the average overall cuts to the foreign operations budget have been 10-11%. But the line items that are most important to Africa have suffered disproportionately severe cuts. The Gilman proposal for FY98 would cut child survival and disease programs by $45 million*, family planning by $57 million, and the Development Fund for Africa (DFA) by another $100 million from their FY97 levels. DFA has already been cut 16% from $802 million to $675 million over the past two years. The African Development Foundation (ADF) has been cut from $16.9 million to $11.5 million over the same period, a 32% reduction. Gilman's proposal would keep refugee and migration assistance as well as disaster assistance at the same levels as FY97. Unprotected programs in &quot;remaining DA&quot; (e.g. microenterprise, democracy, environment, agriculture, and economic growth) look to take even deeper cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proposal would be devastating, because it will set a marker for the budget and appropriations committees as they determine their numbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Action Needed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Call toll free 1-800-962-3524.  When the operator answers Capitol, ask for the Representative by name and they will transfer your call to the Member's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tell Members of the House International Relations Committee that Representative Gilman's proposed cut in development assistance is unfair and unacceptable. With a large percentage of the poorest countries in the world, Africa should not be expected to bear the brunt of further disproportionate cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At an absolute minimum, Congress must adopt the Administration's request for development assistance ($66 million above FY97 levels). If the foreign assistance budget is to be increased, then development assistance should be the top priority for a restoration of funds. Poverty eradication for the most marginalized and vulnerable peoples and countries should be a priority within the accounts, since these programs have been cut so deeply already.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Administration's request is still too low for development program needs, but it is the highest proposal under consideration. Gilman has stated on many occasions his public support for development programs and the PVO community, and we need to encourage him to demonstrate that support by raising the funding levels. The policy makers need to hear from you this week before markup!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela's Budget Vote in Cape Town over the past two days has once more highlighted that the democratic government has the best policies, and the political will and determination to meet the basic needs of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed as the opposition parties concede, policies of the government developed in the theatre of mass struggles are unassailable. What is critical is the need to address the capacity, skills and orientation of the civil service to enable government to fast track delivery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC will endeavour to form a forum which will include Cosatu and our allies with a view to developing a comprehensive strategy towards real and meaningful transformation of the civil service to ensure it is people and service oriented.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this respect, we concur with the President that we owe no-one an apology for struggling in the same trenches with COSATU, the SACP and SANCO. It is an alliance which cannot be exchanged for any monetary gain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the contrary, we will continue strengthening and consolidating the individual and collective components of the alliance with the sole aim of mobilising the majority of the people and deepening our democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In deepening this democracy we will remain seized with discussions and debates on the best model of governance and representation. In this regard, the issue of proportional and contituency based representation must constantly be looked into to ensure it continues to reflect the needs of society in general. The ANC is not married to one single model but to serving the needs of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We further note the preparedness of all political parties to confront racial patterns of voting. This remains the legacy of the past system of apartheid. Part of our transformation process and the movement towards a truly non-racial and democratic society is the need to deracialise all sectors of our country including changing the mindset of all our people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the democratic movement has always been motivated by the need to redress the imbalances created by the apartheid system by equalising opportunities among all people of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whereas government is miles ahead in the implementation of affirmative action, we remain concerned that not all sectors - particularly the private sector - are moving in tandem with changes permeating our society. Various measures have to be looked into with a view to making business march in line with the rest of society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such reluctance on the part of some sectors, including calls for rent and rates boycotts such as in Sandton, can only undermine reconciliation, peace and nation building. For them it is business as usual. We must effectively mobilise the broadest sections of society to strengthen government policies in this respect and undermine such notions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We remain convinced that those who are against reconciliation and nation building constitute a tiny minority of our population and, as in the past, their reasons will come to light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With regard to the issue of informers. we give our unequivocal support to the TRC as the only legitimate structure tasked with the responsibility of handling such a sensitive matter of national importance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC gives its unequivocal support to the government's national crime prevention strategy premised on the need to mobilise the broadest sections of our population, including business, against forms of crime as well as white collar crime which constitutes the biggest threat to our democracy. We remain convinced that both Minister Sydney Mufamadi and Commissioner George Fivaz are equal to the task at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We reject with contempt calls for a national state of emergency. Calls from some quarters for 'quick fix' solutions like these, indicate general ignorance in opposition circles about the causes and depth of crime in society. Such measures would do much for political expedience, but very little to address the core problem. The government must be complemented for standing its ground on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - We saw last week how Mussolini's entry into the European war, on 10 June 1941, led directly to Ethiopia's Liberation, and to the country's occupation by British troops. Now read on:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The collapse of fascist rule, the termination of Italian investment, upon which the Italian East African empire had hitherto been based, the demobilisation of colonial soldiers, many still in possession of their weapons, the disruption of the economy, the consequent drying-up of trade, and hence of government revenue, created major problems for newly liberated Ethiopia, in 1941.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the Emperor, whose pre-war administration had been disbanded five years earlier, nor the British, who lacked any experience of the country, were well equipped to run an efficient post-liberation state. Ethiopian administration was further handicapped by the fact that a significant section of the educated class had died, in some cases been massacred, during the occupation, and because education of &quot;natives&quot; during that period occupation had largely ceased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Post-liberation problems were compounded by the Ethiopian Government's virtual inability to raise taxes, as well as by the presence in the country of 40,000 Italian civilians. The latter were enemy nationals, and hence a security risk, but were expected, in accordance with then contemporary racial values, to be provided, as Europeans, with food, and medical facilities, at the level to which they were accustomed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The politics of the immediate post-liberation era were further complicated by the widespread diffusion of Italian arms, many in the possession of former colonial troops, and by the fragmentation of the Ethiopian elite into three different groups: the Returnees, who had been in exile with the Emperor, and were therefore to some extent out of touch with the situation in Ethiopia; the Collaborators, who had worked with the invaders, and were therefore better informed, but held in disrepute in patriotic circles; and the Patriots, who had played a major role in the liberation, but were in many cases unfamiliar with modern administration. All three groups expected, and to some extent received, posts in government service, as a reward for past services, or in recognition of their influence, or loyalty to the monarch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tensions between the central government and the provinces had to some extent been acerbated by fascist policy, which had tried to divide the &quot; native&quot; population on both ethnic and religious lines. This disintegrative tendency had, however, been largely counter-balanced by other developments of the occupation period. These included the improvement of roads, and the installation of a public radio address system in the principal towns, as well as an awakened sense of Ethiopian patriotism. The political power of the centre was likewise much strengthened by the triumphant return of the Emperor, and by the visible support he received from the British, who in the immediate post-war period enjoyed a virtual monopoly of military power. Like previous rulers he also exercised many forms of patronage, not only, as in the past, in respect of land and political appointment, but now also in the allocation of school places, and scholarships abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A not-insignificant rebellion was, however, soon to flare in Tegray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Emperor, after his return to Ethiopia, was largely preoccupied with relations with the British. The latter, who had entered the country as liberators, had in fact replaced the Italians as an occupying power.  Relations between the Ethiopians and the British were from the outset ambiguous. British policy towards Ethiopia was first enunciated, in general terms, by Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden, who told the British House of Commons, on 4 February 1941, that his government &quot;would welcome the re- appearance of an independent Ethiopian State and recognise the claim of Emperor Haile Sellassie to the throne&quot;. Official British policy was further clarified in high-level talks, held shortly afterwards in February and March.  These were based, in accordance with Eden's statement, on the &quot;rejection of any idea of a protectorate&quot;, or of &quot;the provision of a strong western administration of the country&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the Emperor's return to Addis Ababa, in May, there was, however, considerable tension between the Ethiopians and the British. The two parties differed greatly in their views on the country's future government. The Ethiopians expected to assume full sovereignty without delay, whereas the British considered the country's independence only as a long distance objective. A first clash on this question occurred as early as 11 May 1941, when the Emperor appointed his first post-war cabinet. The British representative, Brigadier Maurice Lush, sternly informed him that such appointments could not be made &quot;until a peace treaty has been effected with Italy&quot; Haile Sellassie was, not surprisingly, indignant. A compromise was, however, duly effected, whereby the British accepted the appointment of the ministers, but &quot;chose to regard them as merely advisers&quot; to the British military administration of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was symptomatic that the Emperor's private mail was for a time subject to British censorship, and opened by British censors. His Imperial Majesty, we are informed, was not amused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tension was further increased by the decision of the British military authorities to appropriate, and take out of the country, some of the principal factories earlier installed by the Italians, as well as weapons, and military and other transport. Ethiopia was thus very visibly empoverished by its liberators, who soon came to be popularly regarded as its looters.  Friction was also created by the presence, in the Ethiopian capital, of white South African troops, who attempted to perpetuate the strict colour bar earlier instituted by the Italians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British opinion in relation to Ethiopia's independence varied greatly. Sir Philip Mitchell, the chief British Political Officer in the Middle East, sought to impose particularly strong control over Ethiopia, but others in London took the view that Great Britain should demonstrate to the world that it could liberate a country without imposing political strings. Sir Philip, because of his official position, was nevertheless able to press the Emperor to abide by British &quot;advice&quot; in &quot;all important matters, internal and external, touching the government of the country&quot;; to levy taxes and allocate expenditure only with &quot;prior approval&quot; of the British Government; to grant British courts jurisdiction over foreigners; &quot;to raise no objection&quot; if the British Commander-in-Chief &quot;found it necessary to resume military control over any part of Ethiopia&quot;; and not to raise armed forces, or undertake military operations, &quot;except as agreed by His Majesty's Government's representative&quot;. Taxation, expenditure, communications, and the jurisdiction of foreigners were to be under British control. In return for this extensive control he proposed that the Emperor be offered a subsidy, British advisers, and the opportunity of discussing proposals for a treaty. British Economic Controls</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia, as a result of its liberation by the British troops, was at this time firmly under British economic as well as political control. The country was incorporated into the British-based Sterling Area, used British East African Shillings, was dependent on a British bank, Barclay's, and was served exclusively by the British Overseas Aviation Corporation, B.O.A.C. Virtually all political power was likewise in the hands of the British military, who went so far as to censor the Emperor's private correspondence. The local British officials were so bent on perpetuating that paramountcy that an American Government memorandum of June 1941 bluntly asserted that Britain was seeking to &quot;establish a protectorate over Abyssinia&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some British officials at this period, and for the next few years, moreover sought to partition the country. In the north there were plans to unite parts of Tegray with the adjacent highlands of Eritrea, to form a new state under British protection. In the south-east the British Government proposed incorporating the already British-occupied Ogaden with British-occupied Somalia, to create a Greater Somalia, under British trusteeship. British official thinking also for a time envisaged the partition of Eritrea, with the western portion annexed to the then Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For all the above reasons, the fund of Ethiopian good-will towards Britain, the Country's Liberator, was steadily dissipated, giving way to fear, suspicion, mistrust, and even anger.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Just consider the following realities about the Ethiopian economy at present:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* land is still a state monopoly and cannot be bought or sold on the free market;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the largest bank in the country, the CBE, which is naturally the largest single source of commercial credit is still government-owned;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the bulk of large-scale industry continues to be under the control of the state;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the state is the biggest employer in the modern sector of the economy;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* foreign exchange dealing is still a government monopoly exercised through the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), with only a few so-called authorized dealers and clients;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the government is still the biggest investor in the land;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* nationalized private properties continue to languish under state ownership;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* expensive, state-sponsored development programmes such as the government agricultural extension programme are still dominant;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* business monopolies owned and funded by the ruling parties but incorporated under the guise of private proprietorship have mushroomed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* the bulk of the housing stock in urban areas is owned by the government;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* most house rents and fuel prices are controlled by the government;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* virtually all utilities, including electricity, telecommunication, water, train, air transport and bus services are owned and run by the government;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* All sorts of cooperatives, but mainly farmers' cooperatives, are now being reorganized by the government, professedly on a voluntary basis, but in reality under duress;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* interest rates are largely determined by administrative means;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* bureaucratic control is extensive;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More briefly, of the three major factors of production, mainly land, labour and capital, land is controlled one hundred percent, which automatically confers a 33.33 recent control of the national economy on the government, assuming equal weights for each of the three factors of production; since well over 95 percent of the total domestic credit for working and investment capital is provided by the CBE, the Development Bank of Ethiopia (DBE), Construction and Business Bank (CBB) and the NBE, all of which are state- owned, the government's control over the supply of capital is obviously enormous; as the major employer in the modern sector, the state enjoys the status of a semi-monopsony on the wage labour market, making it more or less a wage pacesetter in the national economy, with the possible recent exception of a few sectors such as banking, insurance and some specialized services.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because the government's control over the factors of production is still extensive, the market for final goods and services, although it may seem free in appearance, is really not so: house rents, as pointed out above, are partly determined directly by the stage and wholly influenced indirectly through land lease fees which are controlled via state manipulation of the availability of land; the prices of domestically produced goods and services are affected by state determined house rents, land lease fees, collusion by politically affiliated business monopolies, government-determined interest rates, NBE-manipulated exchange rates, the influence of minimum wage legislation with respect to labour costs, state-fixed utility fees and charges, and, last but by no means least, costs emanating from bureaucratic delay and corruption. In other words, a domestic manufacturer of shoes, to take just one example, would have to list the following major expenses in working out his cost build-up:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the government's still extensive control on the factors of production and their costs exerts an all-pervasive influence on the prices of goods and services on the domestic market. At present, it would not be very far from the truth to contend that the state in Ethiopia controls most of the &quot;means of production&quot; and nearly all of the &quot;commanding heights&quot; of the national economy, making it impossible to characterize the economy as being market and private-sector-driven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The consequences have been quite obvious: the economy is growing far below its potential, notwithstanding the 10.2 percent GDP growth rate for 1995/96 officially claimed, which, if true is really a misleading statistical representation of no more than a maize glut obtained at high cost and a statistical weighting procedure that, by the very nature of the Ethiopian economy, is heavily skewed in its favour; an immense, if incalculable, amount of resource wastage; widespread market distortions; and the emergency of a mongrel, crony type of capitalism, with pervasive corruption, favoritism and fast growing income inequalities. Call the present Ethiopian economy what else you may, but it is difficult to describe it as market- and private sector - driven!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What to do? As always and at a very general and theoretical level, what to do is implicit in the major problems stated. The state's control over the factors of production should be greatly diminished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A couple of years ago, Addis Ababa was filled with people claiming that the residents of a certain house were 'demons' and were cannibals to boot. What brought about the tales of midnight sacrifices was nothing more than a painting on the front gate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The painting was finally painted over and the rumors died down--but not completely forgotten. So you might be forgiven if the first image that comes to your mind of the artist in question has a couple of horns thrown in. The reality is of course different as you meet Tibebe Terffa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unable to stay still for long, Tibebe lights one cigarette after another always gesturing with, not just his arms, but seemingly with every part of his body. The painting on the gate that led to a near 'witch hunt' was not a particularly 'significant' one, Tibebe says, adding that he had no particular theme in mind when he drew it. But 'evolution' is very much at the centre of Tibebe's art and explains why he has left behind him the work that those who have no particular desire to ever go to a gallery, will always keep in mind.  A recipient of the 1986 first prize for the illustration of &quot;Children Books&quot; organised by UNICEF and the Ethiopian Children's Commission, Tibebe has had numerous one-man and group exhibitions spanning for over nearly three decades.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Harar 1948, Tibebe grew up with an appreciation of art. &quot;Harar is very colourful and has a very beautiful culture that is intertwined with colour. It is very interesting growing up with colour. The people associate colours with certain things. There is no doubt about it, growing up in Harar has helped me in my art.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa has colours, but not like where I grew up. It is a different kind of colour. You have to look slowly around you. Maybe Addis Ababa is meant to be looked at differently--not by its colours but maybe by the architecture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shrugging his shoulders, Tibebe smiles and says has not yet figured out what the capital has to offer. Many of his paintings are still inspired by his home town, Harar--as can be seen in the fourteen out of the thirty-five pieces he has on exhibit until at Asni Arts Veranda until the end of the month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, he admits that Addis Ababa does also play a part in his works but noted, &quot;You are the one who creates everything. Where ever you are you are, it is your character as well as your emotion that are very much important. Some surroundings can be in harmony with this. Harar is like something that is 'prepared,' ready for you. It is like picking from something that is clear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa requires for you to collect the strewn pieces. What is nice about Addis Ababa though is that you can find different people and cultures in it. But now, it is not places that have that pushes me to work. It is my inner conflicts that do that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conflict and striving to go beyond what he 'discovered' in his last work, marks Tibebe out. This has probably led to some people thinking that he lacked a certain direction. But a true colourist and a man dedicated to experimenting , his works are not only different from each other, giving the viewer the chance to get away from a monotonous 'style'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like any other kid,&quot; Tibebe recalls, &quot;with a special inclination, I would scribble away at home and go looking for paint to use. Then I did not think of myself as an artist or as someone who would become one. I think my love of art grew when I was in high school. There were clubs you could join and Peace Corps teachers who knew something about art would give us some instruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While in Addis Ababa for a summer vacation Tibebe saw his first exhibition and decided there and then to apply to the art school. But registration was way past and he was told to come back the next year. And that is what he did.  As soon as he finished tenth grade, Tibebe made his way to the Addis Ababa Fine Arts School only to find out that he had once again missed the registration. Luckily for him, one of the instructors, Gebre Kristos Desta-- an outstanding artist who introduced abstract art into Ethiopia -- asked to see his sketches and afterwards recommended him to be accepted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five years later, in 1973, Tibebe graduated and for the next seven years taught art at Medhane Alem Comprehensive School in Harar. Due to the poor preparation of schools to give students background in art at an early age, Tibebe found them lacking even the basics. His time at the school therefore was full of frustration--only made better by the few students who showed an aptitude that he taught during break and after school, as well as the numerous paintings he managed to do himself. Tibebe had held one-man exhibitions before graduation--at the Ras Hotel in Dire Dawa in 1969 and at the Anbessa Hall in Harar the following year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same year he had a group exhibitions at the Municipality Hall in Dire Dawa. In 1971 he had another at the United States Information Service (USIS) and at the Circolo Italiano in Asmara in 1972. Graduating just a year before the revolution though seemed to have put a temporary halt to the growing art scene in the country and it was in 1980 that Tibebe once again showed his works to the public. That year he had an exhibition at the Italian Cultural Institute along with Teshome Bekele. Despite the fact that art had now an 'ideology' as he puts it, Tibebe was able to have a series of exhibitions, mostly at the Goethe Institute as well as at the Alliance Ethio-Francaise and even in Canada.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He only had one year during Emperor Haile Selassie's time to, &quot;enjoy being a good artist,&quot; Tibebe remembers. &quot;Socialism had its own ideology with its own plan for art. So you can consider that period as being in some sort of purgatory--not just for artists but for everyone in general,&quot; however, &quot;it did have some very interesting things about it too. It has managed to bring forth different outlooks. And if you look at the art scene positively now you can see that there are people who have been trained that way. Those artists who have been molded see the desperate state of the poor man . There are a few who took some seven years just studying socialist realism and this should not be wasted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is more than the quest to 'know the unknown' that has given Tibebe an air of innocence that is lacking not only in many artists of his generation, but also in young ones just starting out. There have been a great many paintings done during the ages, and many more will be done in the future, he points out. And if an artist chooses not to do a piece then that does not mean anything. Tibebe does not hold back anything as he states that Ethiopians could probably live a happy life without ever looking at paintings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dishing out a solution to the world's problems with every canvas is also not his style. The presumption that an artist has to look down from his pedestal and explain to the 'lowly' commoner about the piece also does not hold with him. He unselfishly leaves the interpretation of his work to the viewer and listens eagerly to them. Because for Tibebe, it is not the artists who are the 'god' but the common man.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the witnesses' testimonies, from three to five years after the 1974 revolution, the Red Terror campaign was 'in full swing' and they were forced to 'work round- the clock'-- burying as many as twenty-five bodies at a time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENA quoted one of the witness as saying, &quot;I could not mistake the bodies of those people killed by the Red Terror perpetrators for they were not often stripped of their clothes and were soaked in blood.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soldiers were said to have escorted the corpses--with slogans advocating Red Terror around their necks--from various spots around town, including the Derge office, to the grave sites.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - A hotel, a restaurant and a busy supermarket were the targets of a series of hand grenade attacks around the capital over a period of 48 hours between last Saturday night and Monday afternoon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the evening of Saturday 13 April the first blast occurred in the Tigray Hotel at Piazza at 7.45 p.m..</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">A barmaid was killed and 34 injured. A few minutes later, an explosion went off in the Blue Tops restaurant wounding a French couple and four Britons. One of the French victims has been left blind in one eye from the attack and both have now been taken home by air ambulance.  Two of the Britons, apparently here to train Ethiopian police, escaped with multiple lacerations after shielding their wives from the blast. There were reports of at least two other grenade attacks around the city on Saturday night but one failed to explode. A Reuters correspondent who visited an alleged target -- the Meridian Hotel on Bole Road -said it was undamaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday afternoon, a grenade was lobbed into the Tana supermarket in Merkato. Thirty-three people were injured in the blast, the attack took place at about 5 p.m. when the supermarket is usually crowded with after-work shoppers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia has suffered under the hands of terrorists on numerous occasions in recent years. So far no one has claimed responsibility for the latest attacks. The trend in the past seemed to be to target big government-owned hotels such as the Ghion and Wabe Shabelle Hotels in Addis. Speculation is everywhere about who is attacking who, and why. The alarming fact is the victims appear to be innocent civilians and police are warning people to take particular care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anyone with information about the attacks has been asked to come forward.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Lawyers of Negussie Hailu Abera, Eskinder Kidane, Munir Duri and Marta G/Hiwot, accused of being accomplices of Former Deputy PM and Minister of Defense Tamrat Layne -- who faces three counts of abuse of power - - questioned the right of the five-man panel at the federal supreme court to see their cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though looking tired, Tamrat nonetheless appeared more relaxed Tuesday than his first time before the panel 27 March--even chatting and laughing with the other defendants--one government official and the other businesspeople accused of being his accomplices, as they waited for the trial to be in session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven of the other defendants were present this time to give their deposition, including Shadia Nadim Kassim (47) who had failed to appear last time because of ill health. Shadia and her son, businessman Wassim Abdela Kassim's lawyer also asked for more time to study the charges and in the case of the former asked that bail should be granted. Bail was denied as in the case of Marta G/Hiwot (accountant) who made a similar request for the second time Tuesday. The court has ordered that the other defendant, Hussien Abdela Kassim--who has disappeared since the investigation began--be found and appear in court next time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tamrat Layne's lawyers, Seleshi Kessela told the court they needed more time to study the charges, while Gulilat Tilahun W/Yessus (former head of the prime minister's office during Tamrat's premiership at the time of the transitional government) was told by the court to get a lawyer and state his objections to the charges against him next time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Negussie Hailu Abera (28), businessman, Eskinder Kidane (31), businessman, and Munir Duri (31), businessman were jointly represented by Tameru Wondem Agegnehu, Solomon Teshome and Bekure Asefa. In a fourteen- page document, the lawyers pointed out that this court had no mandate to see the cases of their clients because it could only see those of high level federal officials, and these had held no official offices. The fact that they had no official posts also went against the grain of the charge of accomplice in the 'abuse of power,' they argued.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document also stated that use of the special penal code instead of the criminal code in charging the defendants was inappropriate because while some articles mentioned were outdated and referred to 'revolutionary' times of the former government, others had been replaced-- and all carried harsher penalties. Moreover, their clients were not government or public officials for whom the law had been promulgated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specific mention was made in the document of the USD 16 million that business tycoon Mohammed Al Amoudi was alleged to have loaned the government and that was apparently embezzled by some of the defendants, including Negussie. The document argued that even if the charges could be proven to be true, it was an individual's money, and the government and public were not hurt by the action--thus making the article cited by the prosecution irrelevant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Taking into consideration all these objections and others--which included the prosecution's failure to make evidence accessible to the defendants--the lawyers asked that the case against their clients be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marta G/Hiwot's Lawyer also pointed out that in the 'interest of justice' the charges against his client who had no official posts should be seen by another court--since among other considerations, by having their cases heard here first, they lose the right to appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court granted the prosecution's request for more time to answer to the defendant's objections and adjourned the trial until Wednesday 7 May 1997.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The struggle for survival in Addis is getting ever more intensified. Youngsters who have despaired of finding jobs and whose parents and relatives can no longer provide them with the basic creature comforts are resorting to crime in droves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One only needs to visit a few of the criminal courts in Addis to witness the hundreds of manacled, heavily guarded alleged juvenile and young criminals awaiting justice. Surely, prison houses around the city must be bursting at the seams!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Youngsters who are still managing to keep well within the law and whose parents, relatives or friends have still not stopped giving them a modicum of material and financial support hang around bars and caf&lt;130&gt;s and loiter in the streets. Bars and eateries at Arat-kilo, the Piazza, Amist-kilo, Kazanchiz and practically at all places where chairs are available on verandahs are filled with such unemployed persons, among whom are to be found a fair number of middle-aged and elderly people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strong-willed read local newspapers on a hire basis, small change from their families and other supporters providing the means for cups of tea as well as for the newspaper rentals. These types of the young unemployed may be seen filling in American immigration DV forms or scrubbing the so-called fast, win-now lottery tickets. The less unyielding look downcast through and through, being largely uncommunicative and their listless eyes staring at the void.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They give the impression of one who is pondering on the eternal, philosophical question of: &quot;What is the purpose of life, human life, to be precise?&quot;, and has just put forward the answer: &quot;Life was a mistake and man, a blunder!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move on in the streets of Addis and you will find people who are more resolute, but also more unfortunate. These are the importunate beggars and street-dwellers, some hopelessly, and devastatingly to the observer, ravaged by disease and pestilence. Their begging hue and cry, invoking the hallowed names of saints such as St. Gabriel and St. Michael, fills one's heart and mind at once with intense consternation, inexplicable dread and deep compassion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The indomitable human spirit embodied in a beggar whose body has been half eroded by leprosy reminds every able-bodied passerby that, by comparison, his or her problems pale into insignificance and that all of us must be thankful for small mercies! But when one is constantly bombarded by the agonizing cries of so many unfortunate persons everyday of the week, one is apt to build a carapace of callousness born of fatalistic resignation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Compassion fatigue&quot; is a typical symptom of such surrender to fate, to the detriment of these unfortunate people. Isn't there something more dignified and more lasting that the rest of society can do for these long-suffering people than throw them small change while walking past?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As you move on up and down the streets of Addis, you will definitely come across tens of thousands of people who are no doubt much more fortunate than those described above, but who nevertheless live on the brink of destitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These include street-vendors of all types, among whom are found kerb- vendors (including &quot;gulits&quot;), lottery-ticket peddlers, newspaper sellers, used-clothes vendors, hawking barterers, mattress repairers, mop hawkers, fruits and vegetables sellers, shoe-shine boys and the like. This section of the society in Addis apparently earns just enough to survive, but as would be expected, the majority of them are undernourished and shabbily dressed, some in tatters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Move up the social and economic ladder and you will see people who are better nourished and better dressed, but most have no homes of their own, the majority live in very small overcrowded rented huts, rents being as high as 10 birr per square meter of floor space for that category of housing! Lacking cooking space, most of these people are forced to eat out at eateries of extremely low hygiene standards. Eateries which have somehow developed a reputation for relatively good food are literally congested with human beings trying to stay their hunger at meal hours, portions being no more than a few morsels!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gone are the days when it was considered undignified especially for elderly and married people to queue up for food and eat out! Cases of people who get sick from contaminated food and water are very many. Food poisoning is a common cause of illness in Addis. Typhoid fever caused by water from the mains contaminated with sewage has been frequently reported, including in the government-owned mass media. These classes of people in Addis also suffer from lack of affordable transport services other than buses. At rush hours, buses must be seen to be believed for the extent of their congestion, although recently the purchase of new buses by the government-owned bus company has relieved the pressure somewhat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These classes of people are typically composed of civil servants and public enterprise employees. Their wages and salaries ranging from 105-900 birr per month are low compared to the cost of living which has, by some yardsticks, increased nearly seven-fold over the last twenty years, whereas most such incomes have barely trebled over the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spend about 28 percent of their incomes on house rents on the private housing market; over 50 percent on average is taken up by expenditure on food; the remainder is apportioned to transportation, medical care, personal expenses, clothing, etc., with practically no savings even for the higher- income groups within the range. Prospects for some members of this group of owning second-hand cars and residential houses are almost totally precluded by the sky-high prices and costs of these commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relatively good agricultural production largely due to good weather abated the rise in the rate of inflation in 1994/95 and 1995/96, but 1996/97 may witness a rising trend in the cost of living. Weather conditions are not expected to be as favourable as they were in the preceding two years; so there may be a rise in food prices; the very exorbitant increases made recently by the government and the administration of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church in house rents on government- and church - owned houses and buildings are beginning to be passed on to consumers one way or another; Similarly, recent petrol price increases are being passed through; Hence, of late some taxis have increased fares from 40 to 50 Ethiopian cents for a distance of slightly over a kilometer; oranges have gone up to 3.50 from 2.50 birr per kilo; cups of tea and coffee have been notched up by 10 cents in some bars and cafes; the price of a small bottle of beer of all the brands has been put up by 50 cents to 3.50 birr despite the recent reductions in sales and excise taxes; owners of eateries who are at the moment in two minds about putting up food prices are letting the quality of the food deteriorate and the quantity shrink; clients are afraid to complain too much about all this, being fully aware of the predicament businesspeople are being made to face as a result of the unconscionable rent rises; but customers of eateries in Addis are paying for their reticence with their health, many suffering from acute and chronic illnesses caused by contaminated food and drink.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor do the physical conditions of Addis Ababa offer a palliative for the many-sided sufferings of humans residing in it. The state-owned housing stock, accounting for about 51 percent of the total, is ramshackle; the stench of human excrement and urine rising from the sides of streets and roads is unbearably noxious; litter is everywhere; in short, one should not be fooled by the glitter along the Bole road, for that is a deceptive facade representing no more than a very small fraction of the city and the population living in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More representative are clogged sewers (many with used condoms) spewing forth rank sewage and street-dwellers lying prostrate and supine in deep sleep - this last one being a desperate move deliberately brought about by petrol sniffing to fend off the pangs of hunger!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, increasing human misery has intensified the struggle for survival in Addis. Ironically, it is the social classes who are emerging as the relative winners in this struggle who can do something to alleviate this suffering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These are the people with the education, experience, know-how and capital who can mobilize the less fortunate to transform life in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government with its bureaucracy should stand by their side and should itself scrupulously perform its duties and functions. To this end, let the government make available, by whatever means, the 30,000 hectares of utilized land in Addis to people who can make productive use of it. This task deserves a separate urban land administration authority which should expedite its work by using &quot;kebeles&quot; (districts) which have in the past proved their effectiveness in large-scale operations of this nature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let simultaneous land distribution operations be conducted in all the &quot; kebeles&quot; in Addis where there are unoccupied tracts of land. Land recipients may be classified as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* those who buy land by open auction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* those who obtain land on lease (these would be foreigners);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* those who get land free (low-income Ethiopians)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* those who get land as partial compensation for land confiscated by the Derg</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strangely enough, in a country where capital is far scarcer than either land or labour, land at the moment is the scarcest of the three major factors of production, namely land, labour and capital (enterprise is here, for the sake of convenience, subsumed under labour). An outline of the seamy and unofficial side of life in Addis has been attempted above. If we don't want to be ashamed of talking about it anymore, let us do something about the artificial land shortage and about a few other major things and set the stage for a historic transformation of life in the nation's capital!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - If Joel Stransky had known Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff was going to quit, maybe he would have stayed in South Africa, but now he's found happiness and form in England</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">RUGBY: by Mick Cleary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YOU gauge a man's true fortune not by examining his bank balance but by peering into his soul. Last year, Joel Stransky, the much-feted, well- rewarded, match- winning hero of South Africa's World Cup campaign, was bankrupt in spirit. It was not that the selectors had lost faith in him; it was that he had lost faith in them and all that they stood for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was completely disillusioned with the whole national set-up,&quot; says Stransky. &quot;All the players were aware of the problems within. It's since been proved that it wasn't a healthy environment. For me, it was time to either pack it all in or move on.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stransky moved on. He signed for Leicester, made his debut in mid-January and has since scored more than 160 points. He is still the linchpin of Leicester's bid to land the cup, the club having crashed so comprehensively from grace in the league last week at Bath. But it might have been so different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man largely responsible for Stransky's disenchantment was Andre Markgraaff, the coach forced to resign two months ago after making racist remarks about &quot;kaffirs&quot;.&quot;If I'd known the coach was going to be sacked, then maybe I would have stayed,&quot; says Stransky. &quot;But it has worked out brilliantly here. My family and I are very content and I wouldn't want to change it now.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Stransky, the sun quickly dimmed across the rugby landscape of the Mandela-Pienaar rainbow nation. Just 12 months after hitting the extra-time drop goal which won the World Cup for the Springboks, Stransky found himself axed from the side by Markgraaff. But there is far more to Stransky's story than mere pique over selection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was a newspaper story that I had a pregnant schoolgirl mistress,&quot; says Stransky. &quot;It was a complete fabrication. To this day, I don't know where it came from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My wife was in hospital after just giving birth to our first child. A reporter sneaked into the ward and accosted her with this story. It was all very distressing. It was a total lie yet the coach obviously didn't believe me because he questioned me about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was told later that the scandal was the reason I was left out of the winter tour party. I knew then that as long as he was coach, I couldn't play for the side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It wasn't just my problems which bothered me. I'd been injured so I hadn't expected to make the tour. It was more than that. Markgraaff lied and bullshitted us all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was fed up, too, that we seemed to be turning the clock back 20 years.  Guys who had done so much to improve our image at the World Cup were removed from office. It was as if you'd built up a million-dollar corporation and then just let it go bust. It was a huge step backwards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stransky is reluctant to be drawn into outright condemnation of men such as Louis Luyt, the self-styled supremo of South African rugby. It doesn't take much guesswork, though, to figure that Stransky, an English-speaking South African liberal, is not a fully paid-up member of the harsh old Afrikaaner ethos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stransky, aged 29, has two more years to run on his Leicester contract.  There is, however, a release clause should he be recalled to the Springbok colours for the series with the Lions. A 26-man squad will be announced on June 2. Will he be in it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He's a contender,&quot; says Carel du Plessis, Markgraaff's successor. &quot;Of course, it's difficult to assess from afar. Next week, we're due to receive video tapes of his games. Joel obviously has the temperament and skills, but to be fair to the present squad, they're playing at a higher pace and intensity in the Super 12.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As Leicester coach, Bob Dywer's view is not the most impartial, but as a World Cup- winning coach himself with Australia, his insights are more penetrative than most.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are only two complete fly-halves in the world at the moment,&quot; says Dwyer. &quot;Andrew Mehrtens of New Zealand is one of them, Joel is the other. We haven't yet got the full worth of Joel at Leicester simply because our players are only just dipping their toe into professionalism, whereas Joel was a professional in the amateur era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By that, I mean his preparation is meticulous. He'll get the three- quarters to test the wind in different corners during the warm-up, check the run of the ball on the grass, assess the softness of the ball on the bounce - nothing is left to chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The South Africans currently fancy Henry Honiball, who is part fly-half, part centre. I'd play Stransky. If he does play against the Lions, he'll be at least as good as the bloke he marks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dwyer tongue almost pierced his cheek with that last remark. The Lions would clone a British grandmother to get a fly- half of Stransky's worth.  Stransky is averaging more than 16 points a match, has a 75% success rate with penalty kicks and was almost wholly responsible for Leicester at Gloucester in the Pilkington Cup semi- final. He almost repeated the trick last week only for Gloucester to snatch the League game deep into injury time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the all-round play of Stransky that night which convinced many that he is proving the best of all the overseas buys. He made four lacerating breaks, three of which led directly to tries. That the two men who flank him in Leicester's midfield, Austin Healey and Will Greenwood, will be on the British Lions flight to South Africa is no coincidence. Those who curl the top lip at the influx of overseas players might ponder that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Overseas players always draw criticism,&quot; says Stransky. &quot;In the early Nineties, I played two seasons in Italy alongside Campo, Tim Gavin, Jason Little and other foreigners. At that time, Italy couldn't beat France's second team. Now they are on the verge of entry to the Five Nations and beat France a week after they had won the Grand Slam. Is that just mere chance, or did the overseas players raise standards?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The English game, for all its new-found energy and brightness, still lags behind its southern hemisphere cousin. &quot;It's much slower here,&quot; says Stransky.  &quot;But that's no surprise. It took the Super 12 four years to sort itself out.  This is year one for English rugby. The European Cup is a big move in the right direction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stransky says there is nothing innately wrong with skill levels of players in these parts. &quot;But the teams themselves are inconsistent - good one week, poor the next,&quot; he says. &quot;That's why the Lions will find it tough. There are a lot of guys in the party who play Second Division rugby. And that itinerary, man, it's murderous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stransky has fewer doubts, though, about the choice of captain, his Leicester team- mate Martin Johnson. &quot;Ideally, you'd want an experienced leader, used to pressure and a proven ambassador,&quot; says Stransky. &quot;The Lions don't have such a figure. If anyone can step into the role, Johnson can. He's a fantastic player, sensible, logical and knows what to say and what not to say. He's also a nice guy and, believe me, that's half the battle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Master blaster Stransky is unfussy, unshowy but devastatingly effective. He also is a nice guy. These days, he's a much happier one, too.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Time is what South Africa's young cricketers need to mature into a competitive team, but there is not much of that available before a tough tour to Pakistan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FOR many of South Africa's cricket-loving public this has been a disappointing summer. Beaten in India away and trashed by the Aussies in both the Test and one-day series played here. And there lies little hope of a quick fix to this national unease ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For next on the agenda are tours of Pakistan and Australia, perhaps the two most unforgiving nations on earth when they have the advantages of their home turf and local following behind them. This, one would venture to put forward, is a forbidding and uncomfortable prospect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not all doom and gloom though. There is much to be thankful for in the performances of the South Africans - although they lacked anything like the consistency for victory - and the nascent mix that is to make up the national team over the next few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Especially when the prospect of having three word-class all-rounders in the team starts becoming a reality. Shaun Pollock, Man of the Series in the largely disappointing series of one-dayers, Lance Klusener and Jacques Kallis all have the abilities to prosper with both bat and ball. And this is even without adding the mighty Brian McMillan into the mix. Big Mac is not ready to quit just yet, thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All three have what it takes to become the backbone of a side which will run through to the next century and do this country proud. It is also a frightening prospect that - in the one-dayers at least - they already have what it takes to make virtually any side in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pollock is the classicist, a deceptively gentle amble up to the crease to deliver top-class seam bowling and a smooth batting ability that has yet to fully flower. He may not be his father Peter as a quickie, although the delivery stride is almost uncannily similar. He may also not ever reach the flowing abilities of his uncle Graeme with the bat. But he is a rare gem in both departments. One can only hope that the foot inury that sidelined him, and which has surely been troubling him against the Aussies, comes right before he travels to the Indian sub-continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Klusener, coaxed back from the canefields of KwaZulu-Natal to concentrate on the game, is equally a man who - despite his debut eight-wicket haul and run-a-ball maiden century for this country - has still to produce his very best. His cricketing aggression is starting to be tempered with some of the wisdom of experience against the world's best. No side can be without as talented and willing a workhorse as Klusener undoubtedly is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kallis too has everything yet to play for. A batsman born to the top of the order, he has also served his side well with his deceptive medium pace bowling. When both reach the level of consistency of which Kallis is capable, you will have a player who will make even a Steve Waugh blanch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What it will take is time. One hesitates to say that this leeway is an essential part of a tour of either Pakistan or Australia. But then, there was never an epic battle won without some blood being spilt on the sand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloody nose the Aussies engendered has led to much recent criticism of both captain Hansie Cronje and the national selectors. Some of it may well be justified in that the mix they have jointly been seeking has not quite emerged as anything near workable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herschelle Gibbs, a man destined to make many runs for this country, has been forced - willingly or unwillingly - to take a step backwards by being asked to open the batting. It has done him, his averages, and the national pride in the young Capetonian little good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It cannot be too loudly stressed that assets are to be coveted and cosseted; used sparingly and well. Sadly, even if the good of the team has been paramount, this has not been the case with Gibbs. If he is the player all and sundry suspect he is, he will survive it. If not, we have squandered a treasure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His counterfoil in the dying stages of the limited overs series, Adam Bacher, has also not come quite as good as the staggeringly successful provincial form which propelled him into the side. Bacher though is a fine player and a great investment. Like Gibbs, he holds the future and nurturing his talents is essential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in defence of Cronje, he has played through a slump and done a captain's job, gutsing it out when he was not in full nick against a side as deeply determined and full of fight as the Aussies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has also had a top order that has floated like a butterfly without displaying even a hint of a string. That, sadly, has too often been left for the tail to provide. Cronje remains, despite recent results, one of the best captains this country is ever likely to be blessed with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The selectors, too, have surely made mistakes. But they have made some good choices to counter this in many respects, leaving Paul Adams on the sidelines for much of the time against Australia is evidence of some pattern of forward thinking. We need a long career out of the exuberant youngster if we are to prevail in the long term. Perhaps this thinking could equally have been applied to Gibbs though.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have also had the courage to drop stalwarts Andrew Hudson and Gary Kirsten on the simple expedient of sagging form, perhaps a wise move, perhaps not. Batsmen are driven forward largely on historical ability; bowlers rely more directly on the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this regard, the selectors have persisted with bowling Allan Donald into near exhaustion in the limited-overs game, an arena that his particular brand of fire and brimstone - no matter the weariness of a frame which has seen more than just a handful of summers - is not ideally suited to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as already pinpointed, there are no quick fixes to the trauma Cronje, his team and the country behind him, have lately experienced. There are only the closed doors of future opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us then please, whatever it takes, find the right one in the summer to come.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When Kevin Keegan began his eight-day South African coaching assignment in Johannesburg on Tuesday there was a distinct bias to proceedings. Anybody familiar with the way Keegan played or the style of the Newcastle side he led until January would not have been surprised at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'll work with you on finishing, on crossing, on adventurous midfield play but please don't ask me to work with you on how to defend,&quot; the two-time European footballer of the year told the assembled coaches on a South African Football Association level-three course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keegan's bold approach won him nearly every honour in the game, but in the final analysis it was also what probably forced him to quit as manager of Newcastle. Keegan's philosophy at Newcastle seemed to be one of &quot;It doesn't matter how many goals you score because we'll score more&quot;, and although it won the admiration of soccer followers in general and the adulation of the Toon Army in particular, it didn't put trophies in the cabinet.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It should have done and very nearly did when Newcastle were 12 points clear in England's Premier League last season. But melt-down struck during the crucial final run-in and although there are those who claim that Newcastle simply didn't have the necessary bottle it was in fact a far more fundamental problem of too many gaps at the back. Newcastle's derring-do, cavalier spirit was doomed to failure in a game where the end result counts for far more than the way it is achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for Keegan there is no other way. &quot;I was a forward and I was always looking to go and cause problems, to be adventurous and creative and my team reflected that. I think that's the way it is in life. Teams reflect their coaches.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But although for now, while the memory is still fresh in our minds, Keegan's contribution to the beautiful game will be remembered as just that, in time the record books will reflect a very different story. Keegan's failure to win a trophy will indeed be a harsh final judgment on what he actually achieved in five years at Newcastle, but given his time again he wouldn't try to do things differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wouldn't change anything. I had a very exciting team. One that everybody wanted to watch and that everybody is talking about. We were everyone's favourite team in England apart from their own and whenever we were on television the ratings were up by three or four million because people new they'd see a good game,&quot; says Keegan. That is certainly something to be proud of for a club that was on the verge of third division anonymity when Keegan took over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Keegan's frustration at being unable to match his own heady successes as a player, and the pressures of an understanding but still expectant legion of supporters and a not so understanding press, all contributed to his winter of discontent, it was the grey financial men in London who finally nailed Newcastle's Messiah to the cross.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Football is becoming an increasingly big business in England with the advent of huge television contracts and the imminent arrival of even greater riches through pay- per-view television and many clubs are flirting with flotation on the stock market. Despite the hefty backing of Newcastle's chairman and property tycoon, Sir John Hall, who sank R420-million into players alone under Keegan, Newcastle United followed the flotation route as well when it decided to build a new stadium and abandon St James Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't know anything about flotations until the beginning of this season but now I know an awful lot and one thing is for sure, you are not in control.  There are certain things you have to do and one of those is to satisfy the banks. Newcastle had promised the banks it would raise Pounds 6- million after the Shearer deal and by October I was having to sell some of my young players. We had a quality squad but we didn't have a big squad and I didn't think we should be selling three or four players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't like it and I didn't think it made sense but the powers that be said that is what we had to do. The float has changed the club forever now and it won't be that easy to do the things we did before. There are a lot more people to answer to now and while I'm not saying it was a bad thing for the club to do, it was just something I didn't want to be a part of,&quot; says Keegan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a way he was the architect of his own downfall by building Newcastle into a club which is only rivalled by Manchester United and Liverpool in the English game. &quot;The very thing I helped create probably got rid of me in the end. Nobody would have dreamed of floating the club five years ago but now it is feasible. I suppose I'm a bit like Winston Churchill. He was great in the war but when peace time came they got somebody else,&quot; says Keegan .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final nail in the coffin came when the men in suits demanded stability ahead of the flotation and the club insisted that Keegan commit himself to a two-year contract. &quot;I said at Christmas that I wasn't prepared to sign because I didn't want to stay after the end of the season because I felt I'd taken Newcastle as far as I could under the circumstances. Then they asked me to stay until the end of the season and we shook hands on that but the flotation wouldn't allow it and I was given an ultimatum to sign or leave.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is football's loss of course when a man like Keegan leaves the game and perhaps it is time to review the direction the sport is taking when the figures in the profit and loss account become more important than the figures in the league table and the way the game is played. Those days have not yet arrived in South Africa and here Keegan is still able to focus his attention on the less complicated affairs of assisting our coaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm here to try and sow some seeds in their minds. I'm not trying to tell them they must do it this way or that way. Coaching is a lot about your own invention and as long as you follow a few basic rules you can do anything you want provided the players respect what you are trying to do and can understand it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he didn't want to comment on the state of the local game until the end of his trip when he will have worked with the AmaGlugGlug - the national under-23 team sponsored by Sasol who brought Keegan to South Africa - he did play with Cape Town Spurs in the Eighties and knows enough about our game to be positive. &quot;South Africans have got Brazil's kind of flair but they probably need more of the European type of discipline. The difficult part is how to get both and the answer is to expose yourself to both types of training and coaching.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you can get a balance between these two styles then you have got perfection in my eyes. You must work on discipline and the physical side of your game but don't ever try to take away the flair that the South Africans have got because that's what makes them special.&quot; But then what else would you expect a man like Kevin Keegan to say?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In his first year as a professional, Tiger Woods is carving a place among the game's immortals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GOLF: Richard Williams</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WE need sport to be unpredictable. That is the point of it. But from time to time we also need to witness the inevitability of undisputed greatness.  And when Tiger Woods stalked the acres of Augusta National yesterday with the rapturous noise of a packed gallery singing in his ears, it seemed clear that he was staking his claim to the kind of greatness that rewrites the rulebook and redefines the dimensions of a sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The tens of thousands who accompanied him through the four days of the 1997 US Masters, crushed around the tees and greens, even lining the fairways five and six deep, watched his progress with stupefaction and glee, blessing their good fortune for providing them with a ticket to history in the making.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 21, Woods became the youngest man ever to win the US Masters, taking the record from Severiano Ballesteros, who was 23 when he won his first championship in 1980.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was Woods's first major tournament as a professional, and by winning it he continued to fulfil the wildest expectations of those who have watched his career since he won his first pitch-and- putt competition at the age of three, and the many lavish predictions made for his future both in sport and the wider world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Comparisons with his feat at Augusta are few but obvious. In terms of sporting significance, try Roger Bannister, Bob Beamon, Secretariat and Brian Lara. In recent history, Michael Johnson running away with the 400 metres in Atlanta last year is perhaps the nearest thing to Woods's performance at Augusta, since the two feats shared a quality of breathtaking ease which made their fellow competitors appear to be taking part in a separate event altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This seems to be the next generation,&quot; Tom Kite, competing in his 24th Masters, said. &quot;He seems to have leapfrogged the rest of the field.&quot; But Woods's arrival does not really signal a changing of the guard. For a start, there are no other 21-year-olds of similar quality on the horizon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the intrinsic properties of his game - his length and accuracy off the tee, the strategic cunning of his irons, the silky touch with which he putts - are such that he appears to have shifted the entire game up a gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some observers warn that Woods will not always find the going so easy, that on other days at other courses he will not be presented with conditions so clearly encouraging him to take advantage of his unequalled power, which permits him to use short irons to the greens and here enabled him to conquer a series of fiendishly awkward pin positions. But under as fierce an examination as any sportsman can ever have experienced, the young man performed with a calmness, a clarity of purpose and a technical precision that would have seemed almost inhuman had he not come into the interview room each evening and demonstrated his intelligence, modesty and charm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colin Montgomerie, the third of the four men privileged to share the course with Woods during the tournament, provided a series of responses that turned out to be typical of the way his fellow professionals reacted to Woods's historic feat. When the Scot reached the spot where his drive had landed off the 1st tee on Saturday afternoon, he saw that he had outdriven Tiger Woods by a clear 10 yards. He turned to the gallery and grinned. &quot;Get a picture of this,&quot; he ordered. He knew what was coming, and that he was powerless to prevent it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four hours later Montgomerie was in the interview room, explaining why it was not premature to assume that Woods was on his way to victory. &quot;We're all human beings here,&quot; he said, &quot;and there's no human possibility that Tiger Woods is going to lose this tournament. No way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Montgomerie was told that Tom Kite had sat in that seat a little earlier and counselled reporters against giving Woods the victory before he had played the final round, remembering Greg Norman's collapse against Nick Faldo on the last day in 1996. &quot;This is different,&quot; Montgomerie said. &quot;This is very different. Faldo's not lying second, for a start. And Greg Norman is not Tiger Woods.&quot; His tone went further than his words. What he meant was that no one is Tiger Woods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Poor Montgomerie. Four times a leader in the European Order of Merit but never the winner of a major in his 10-year pro career, when he finally got himself into a good position at Augusta it was to discover that this would be Woods's year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUT at least Woods was good company. This was not a factor on Thursday, when his partner was Faldo, who prefers to play the game in a bubble of his own thoughts. And Woods, too, was needing to look inside himself. After shooting a wayward 40 on the front nine holes, he knew that another round-and- a-half like that would put him on the Friday night jet back home to Florida and a weekend of practice at Isleworth Golf Club, where he had prepared for the Masters by shooting a 59, five strokes below the course record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If any single stroke shaped this championship, it was his first-round shot off the 10th tee. Needing to settle himself down, he left his driver in the bag and selected a conservative two-iron. As the ball hummed down the hill into a perfect position, he was on his way to a score of 30 on the back nine, picking up a momentum that he sustained through the second and third rounds, when his opponents fell before him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday he and Paul Azinger played together the way every game should be played. On the 13th fairway Azinger drew the crowd's attention to the fact that he had outdriven Woods by a handful of yards. &quot;The only trouble,&quot; he added, &quot;is that I took a driver and he hit a three-wood.&quot; Woods returned the compliment on the tee at the short 16th, when he applauded his opponent's shot to within a couple of feet of the pin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Throughout this day and those that followed, the champion elect was attended by vast crowds. At the start of each day he would disappear into the tunnel of his concentration, emerging as the day progressed to acknowledge the cheers and benedictions. The loudest shout of all came on Friday, for an eagle at the par-five 13th which provided the second defining moment of the tournament. After he had hit his second shot over the creek to a spot 20 feet from the pin, his putt seemed to roll forever. When it dropped, the roar of delight seemed to shiver the tall pines above the packed hillsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Saturday evening he contrived a sublime finish to his third round by taking advantage of the length of his drive to fire a wedge six feet above the pin, watching the ball pitch on the fringe of the green and spin back at a 45-degree angle on a path straight for the hole, coming to rest a foot away.  At that moment, incredulous laughter was the only available response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jack Nicklaus, whose swift rise to pre- eminence in the early Sixties is the most popular reference point for the emergence of Woods, recognised the quality and remembered how it felt to be playing a wedge to the green when his competitors were needing long irons. &quot;I was sort of laughing and snickering and saying, 'Boy, this is a tough golf course, huh?&quot;' In 1965, when he shot a record 271 for the tournament, his third-round 64 was &quot;like walking down Main Street. It was nothing. And Tiger has the ability to do that. That's why this young man is so special. If he's playing well, the golf course becomes nothing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most tellingly, Nicklaus reminded his listeners of the words with which the late Bobby Jones, the tournament's co-founder, had welcomed his own arrival on the scene. &quot;Mr Nicklaus,&quot; Jones had said in wonder, &quot;is playing a game with which I am not familiar.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's a shame Bob Jones isn't here,&quot; Nicklaus said on Saturday. &quot;He could have saved the superlatives for this young man. Because he's certainly playing a game we're not familiar with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a week when America is celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut in the uniform of the Brooklyn Dodgers, thereby becoming the first black man to play Major League baseball, Woods dominated a tournament in which no black appeared until 1975, when Lee Elder broke through a barrier that had existed since the inauguration of the Masters in 1934.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charlie Sifford, who failed in his battles to persuade the club to invite him to compete during the Sixties, issued a statement this week in which he welcomed Woods's success. &quot;It would be my dream come true for him to win on Sunday,&quot; he said. &quot;I tried so hard to get the opportunity to play there. I am not angry about it. The people at Augusta had their rules and I can respect that. I stood up for what was right and I am not ashamed of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Woods was asked what he thought Elder and Sifford would be feeling as they watched him. &quot;I think they'll probably be going through several emotions,&quot; he said. &quot;One, I'm sure they wish it could have been them. But I love those guys to death and they love me, and I know they're very proud of what I've done so far.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVEN today most of the black faces at Augusta National are behind the counter, serving lunch to the green-blazered members in the clubhouse, or emptying the litter bins along the fairways. There is a feeling, perhaps fanciful, that this weekend's events will help hasten the slow process of practical, rather than theoretical, equalisation of opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In my estimation,&quot; Woods said on the eve of the final round, anticipating the effect of his victory, &quot;it's going to open a lot of doors, a lot of opportunities, and draw a lot of people into golf who never thought of playing the game. I think it's going to do a lot for the game as far as minority golf is concerned.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a potent symbol, although opinions are divided about exactly what he symbolises, and to whom. Yesterday afternoon, as if the events at Augusta were not enough, the CBS-TV network broadcast a documentary called Tiger Woods: Son, Hero and Champion, a gauzy bit of myth- propagation made and paid for by Mark McCormack's International Management Group, which handles Woods's affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phil Knight, whose Nike Corporation agreed a deal with IMG that guaranteed Woods $40 million (Pounds 25.2 million) as soon as he turned pro last year, has his own version of the meaning of Tiger Woods. Nike's typically controversial opening campaign cast Woods very explicitly as a member of an oppressed minority, with an abrasive edge that seems hardly apparent in his real personality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knight was there to welcome Woods back to the clubhouse each evening, along with a posse of Nike people. &quot;He's making us look smart,&quot; the world's richest shoe salesman said, enjoying the chance to laugh in the faces of those who had doubted the wisdom of his company's gamble in promoting Woods alongside Michael Jordan and Michael Johnson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the issue of Woods's ethnicity is more complicated and interesting than Knight's marketing men would like us to believe. As the Los Angeles Times recently pointed out, his father is half African American, a quarter Native American and a quarter Chinese, while his mother is half Thai, a quarter Chinese and a quarter white. Their son may be all of that, but he is something else besides.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - SUZY BELL speaks to reggae superstar Lucky Dube about the release of his new album Taxman - and other taxing matters</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE sits comfortably cross-legged in the Oppenheimer suite of the Edward Hotel with a toffee-coloured woolly tea cosy of a hat hiding his trademark Rasta dreads. His speech is slow and deliberate, with more than a hint of that laid-back but irritating American twang. Lucky Dube still repeats his mantra-like dictum: &quot;I write for the people, about the people.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this time a word slides rather too often into the conversation. Money.  So much so that Taxman is the title track, and he's chosen to sing about it in the first single of his new album with the chorus: &quot;What have you done for me lately Mr Taxman?'' So reggae artists don't just sing about slavery and oppression no more; it's now about the money, honey!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with Dube's superstar status there's certainly no lack of it. His record company, Gallo, boast that Dube is &quot;South Africa's most successful solo artist, ever''. Even in Ghana, Dube has become the first South African artist to have sold more than 20 000 legitimate copies of his album - some feat for such highly pirated territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps this is why he can say &quot;Phooey!'' to the fact that his contract states he must release an album each year. &quot;I will only record when I'm ready, '' he says unequivocally. In the same strident tone he announces: &quot;The people believe in my music.  It's good music and I believe in it. Those that don't believe in it must just stay out of it.'' I suppose it does annoy him somewhat that some say he dilutes the rawness of reggae by experimenting with new sounds, like he does in Taxman, incorporating mbaqanga and rock guitar elements as well as strings and a vocal duet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's still based firmly in the reggae tradition,'' he insists. &quot;I don't want to sound like Peter Tosh or Bob Marley. I am different.'' Yes, but what's the difference between saying you're a vegetarian, as Dube asserts, but in the next breath admitting to feeling nothing when slaughtering a goat for an ancestral offering. &quot;I don't feel bad, because that's different.'' Really ? &quot;Yeah, mon, it's not for a braai. And I speak to the goat first.'' Yeah, mon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he's quite puritanical about saying that just because he's a rastaman and he sings reggae it doesn't mean he smokes ganja all day. &quot;In fact I don't like ganja. A lot of the other reggae artists have got all messed up smoking too much ganja. Yeah, Marley smoked a helluva load of ganja, but that's not what made him write beautiful songs. He was a gifted, hard- working musician.  ''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So how come this anti-dope-smoking, semi- vegetarian rasta with natty dreads is popular in Japan and Hawaii and equally big in the United States and the United Kingdom? &quot;I think it's because in the other countries they listen carefully to my messages in the songs.'' Right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So Dube's back on tour this July to Colombia, then the US, back to Africa, and across to the South Pacific. And the harder he works, the more he tours, the more popular he becomes, the more albums he sells, the more money he makes, the more the dreaded taxman cometh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that Dube professes musicians shouldn't pay tax, but he is worried about &quot;all the millions of taxpayers' money that are disappearing. Some of that money should be reinvested back into the creative community. The money the musicians pay in tax, that we all pay through tax, where is it going? It really worries me.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But something he's quite blas' about is that women all over Africa claim to be his wives and claim they have children to prove it. &quot;Yeah this woman in Maputo says her two children are mine and in Zaire there's this woman who says she's my sister. She came to Johannesburg with her brother tell me my father is dead and they can't bury him without me and that kind of shit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there are no women out there that I've left alone with a child. I have three children of my own and that's all. If there is a child of mine out there I don't know about it unless I'm Joseph from the Bible.''</SPAN></P>
