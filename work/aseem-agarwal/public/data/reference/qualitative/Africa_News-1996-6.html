<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS, United States (PANA) - Nigeria's under-23 team captain Nwankwo Kanu said he never felt that the team would lose to Brazil, even when they were two goals down with 12 minutes to go in Wednesday's second semi-final of the Olympic soccer tie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu, the two-goal hero of Nigeria's 4-3 victory against Brazil said his confidence was based on the fact that the south Americans were tired in the second half.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We saw that the Brazilians were not playing. They were tired and they were missing a lot of chances,&quot; Kanu told a packed post-match conference.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believed in ourselves that we were going to do it and by the grace of god, we have done it,&quot; the Nigerian forward said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He challenged a journalist's assertion that he was losing the leadership of the team to more-aggressive players like Emmanuel Amunike or Daniel Amokachi, saying: &quot;I don't think so, I am the leader.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you are calling the team leader, I am the team leader, so there is no problem in the team. And I have tried all my best...if I am not a good team leader, we can't be there (in the final),&quot; said Kanu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the final match against Argentina on Saturday, Kanu, locked in a salary arbitration battle since June 15 over a proposed multi- million-dollar transfer from Ajax Amsterdam to Internazionale of Italy, promised that his team would work hard for victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria has never won the trophy, and we have come all out to win,&quot; he told the conference, adding &quot;so if Argentina is coming out to play all their best, we are also coming out to play all our best.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu's goal in the 90th minute levelled score for Nigeria at 3-3, and he sent the country to its first-ever Olympic soccer final with a clincher four minutes into the sudden-death extra time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS, United States (PANA) - Nigerian technical adviser Jo Bonfrere has described the country's 4-3 victory over Brazil in the semi-finals of the Olympic soccer event as a sign of maturity of African football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere told reporters after the match, played in Athens, U.S., that there was no longer any gap between a &quot;good-playing team&quot; like Brazil and a team from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the gap between the good playing teams and African and Asian teams is very close and it is now a matter of tactic and how the players themselves approach matches,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch coach said his team encountered a lot of organisational problems which, he said, disturbed its preparations for the tournament, recalling that five days to the start of the competition, he didn't have all his players in camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I talked with the team before this game. I told them to forget all the problems for one-and-a-half hours and then, after this game, we can start with new problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere said that skipper Nwankwo Kanu had not played well in the competition because he reported late to camp, but said that he had decided to forgive him &quot;because he made the final goal today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Brazil's lead cut to 3-2 toward the end of the match, Kanu struck in the 90th minute to force the match into extra time. He scored again four minutes later to ensure Nigeria's first-ever qualification for the Olympic soccer final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Nigerian sports minister Jim Nwobodo says the players have shown, by Wednesday's victory, that they are indeed a &quot;dream team&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only great teams achieve this kind of feat,&quot; the minister, emerging from the players' dressing room, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the match as miraculous, saying &quot;nothing can be better than this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Nigeria Football Association (NFA), retired air commodore Emeka Omeruah, said the outcome of the match was &quot;like a dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian football authorities had pulled all the necessary strings to motivate the country's Olympic soccer team for Wednesday's semi-final match against Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days to the match, the players were all paid their match-winning bonus (for match against Mexico) of 5,000 U.S. dollars each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the players were moved into a hotel in Athens, venue of the match because the accommodation in the city's Olympic village was said not to be conducive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Omeruah promised to do whatever was necessary to put the players in the right frame of mind for clinching the Olympic soccer gold on Saturday, against Argentina at the same venue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS, United States (PANA) - Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo has attributed his team's 3-4 loss to Nigeria in the Olympic soccer semi-final to bad luck and superior play by the west Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I believe it was bad luck, especially to concede a goal in the last minute, &quot; Zagallo, speaking through an interpreter, said after the match at the Sanford stadium in Athens, U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But Nigeria played very well and we have to give it to them,&quot; added the coach, one of only two men in the world to have ever won the world cup both as a player and a coach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zagallo, 64, praised the Nigerian players for their tenacity even when they were two goals down and after they had lost a penalty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The important thing is that Nigeria never lost faith, especially after missing the penalty,&quot; he said. &quot;Instead, they were the ones who took over, and it was an incredible game,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria has shown today that they have a strong potential. They did not lose strength especially when they were losing. They turned it into a very beautiful game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what he would have done differently if the match were to be re-played, the Brazilian coach said that it did not matter what he did or did not do, noting: &quot;the match was bound to be tough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be a very difficult game, just as this one, no matter what,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the overall play of his team, Zagallo, member of Brazil's world cup winning teams in 1958 and 1962, indicated that there might have been too much expectation from his players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the beginning I have said that there is no such thing as easy football,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;we began the competition by losing to Japan, but now we have also lost to a very good team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zagallo, who coached Brazil's 1970 winning team and was assistant coach in 1994, said that he had not lost all hopes of an Olympic medal, promising to go after the bronze in the third-place match against Portugal on Friday at the same venue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, which was 1-3 with 12 minutes to go, cancelled the deficit to send the match into an extra time, where it scored the &quot;golden goal&quot; in the fourth minute to prevail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A crowd of over 78,000 witnessed the dream team's stunning victory, played under 81 degrees heat and cloudy skies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) has back-tracked on its earlier position that it was willing to compromise over the chairmanship of the inter-party talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC general secretary Derrick Chitala said in an interview yesterday that the talks could only succeed if they were chaired by a neutral chairman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is conflict in the nation and arbitration can only be through a neutral chairman,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the UNIP days the church and s tudents were called to mediate so why should it be different now?&quot; Chitala said in a statement that appears to contradict his President Dean Mung'omba's statement last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is in the best interests of the country for us to run away from rigid positions,&quot; Mung'omba said in an interview last Tuesday. &quot;If the chairmanship is a rigid position it should be considered from both our side and that of the ruling party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitala denied that ZDC had backed down, he instead said the ruling party should be reasonable in its demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are dealing with an issue of life and death such as attempts by the government to rig the elections through Nikuv and the constitution which has been rejected by many people,&quot; Chitala said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If some people are not satisfied with the electoral process they will do everything to wreck this country and we are not prepared to allow Chiluba to lead the country to that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ZDC's position further erodes any hope of interparty dialogue taking place as MMD insists that only Chiluba should chair the talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) chairman Roger Chongwe said in an interview on Tuesday the MMD's rigidity showed the party was not interested in dialogue with the opposition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - New population projections for children below five years are being worked out in readiness for the second round of the National Immunisation Days (NIDS), Head of the Maternal Child and Family Planning department in the Ministry of Health, Dr Dean Phiri, has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Phiri, this measure has been taken following a joint meeting held by the Ministry of Health and officials from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) a fortnight ago to find out what led to the running out of vaccines at some posts during the first round of NIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Central Statistics Office is working out details to project vaccine requirements for the next round,&quot; Dr Phiri disclosed at a press briefing yesterday adding that an additional three million Oral Polio Vaccines (OPV) had been ordered to supplement existing stocks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri conceded that during the first round, the NID secretariate underestimated the population figures for children needing immunization resulting in some areas running out of vaccines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The distribution of population figures was different from what was expected,&quot; Phiri said. &quot;We didn't take into account the movement of the population from rural to urban areas since the last census was done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also noted that the declining life expectancy in Zambia has led to a change in the population structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seems to be an increase in the younger population,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He however noted that the overall response to the first round of NIDS was a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of children of 0-5 years immunised throughout the country was over 80 per cent,&quot; Dr Phiri said, adding that the remaining 20 per cent will be catered for in routine programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is just the first phase towards the eradication of polio,&quot; he explained. &quot;The next step is to mop up all remaining pockets of those not immunised through routine programmes.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, complained that financial resources have been depleted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of the funds went towards putting the logistics in place and there is nothing to pay the volunteers,&quot; Phiri moaned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative, Grace Kagondo, disclosed that there are over 40 volunteers country-wide and appealed to various service clubs and the business community to &quot;take care of the volunteers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NID co-ordinator, Mary Kaoma, promised at the same briefing that there would be no shortage of vaccines during the second round of NIDS and urged parents to take their children for the second round of immunisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The second dose is very important as it is a booster and everybody must attend either on August 23 or 24, 1996,&quot; Kaoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy director of medical services, Dr Lendy Kasanda, added: &quot;The first round was just but the first step. We can only thank ourselves if we do well in the second round.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNITRAD representative, Kathryn Mwondela, disclosed that the theme for the eradication of Polio in Africa is &quot;Let's boot it out of Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So let's boot it out,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Political stability is 'a must' for the improvement of the investment climate in Zambia, said Meebelo Mutukwa, Managing Director of Pangaea Associates at a lecture on the Zambian Capital Investment Market at the British Council yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutukwa however, commended the regulations set up for the Lusaka Stock Exchange saying they were more than sufficient to protect the investor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we must create confidence in investors, avoiding abrupt changes and sudden withdrawals in policy and introductions of laws,&quot; he told his audience drawn mainly from the business community.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that inconsistencies in policy had adversely affected the investment climate in the country making it difficult for Zambia to generate confidence in the investment market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia has done so well in creating an enabling environment through instituting a viable legal framework such as the Banking and Financial Services Act of 1994 and the coming Competition and Fair Trading Act. But the problem is with the Investment Act. In the past four years, we have had so many changes in investment policy,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mutukwa gave examples of how some investors had been stuck with equipment which they thought was tax free upon ordering it but later discovered they needed to pay duty on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 1992 budget suspended all incentives in the Investment Act. And after the last budget speech, we now have to pay duty on all equipment. The ability of the government to suspend duty at such short notice might adversely affect investors who had been informed of prior measures,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFJ has also attacked all government's acts of aggression against journalists and called for African states to provide and secure conditions of service for the survival of the profession.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a press statement from Brussels, released after the conference on the &quot;access to information&quot; in Harare, the African nations were implored to free journalists detained for exercising their professionalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a first step, all African States should release from prison any journalists detained for exercising their profession and should incorporate into domestic law all international standards of freedom of expression,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference attended by Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe urged governments to recognise the right to access to information and to incorporate it in the constitution.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Food Reserve Agency has disclosed that they will have a shortfall of 250,000 metric tonnes of grain to be purchased for strategic reserves this season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview yesterday, director of the reserve agency, Chance Kabaghe, disclosed that the government's limited funding to the purchase of grain for the strategic reserves will result in the acquisition of only 50, 000 metric tonnes of grain instead of the required 300,000.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ideally we are supposed to purchase 300,000 metric tonnes but Parliament only allocated K10 billion for the exercise,&quot; Kabaghe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the grain lined up for purchase besides maize are sorghum and millet although 90 per cent of the grain purchase will be white maize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabaghe further disclosed that the sourcing of the grain for the strategic reserves would however mark the start of the market support for economically disadvantaged areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The grain would be sourced from uneconomic surplus areas where traders least go to because of inaccessibility,&quot; he said and named the grain strategic storage points as Isoka, Mwenzo, Kasama, Lundazi and Choma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumbwa warehouse will stock reserve grain for the Western province, a major deficit area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to information from the agricultures ministry's Market Information Bulletin, the operational modalities for the purchases and delivery of stocks will be on open tender basis invited by FRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Northern province has however been allocated 50 per cent of the total funds for the purchase as the area had recorded a high surplus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the limited budgetary allocation for the restocking of the reserves, a programme has been worked out for the gradual collection of grain until it finally reaches the 300,000 metric tonne mark in storage.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Farmers in Eastern Province are facing food shortages due to the low maize prices in the 1995/96 marketing season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Small scale farmers in Chipata's Musanga valley said though they had a surplus of maize initially, necessity had forced them to sell most of their stocks to traders who are exporting the maize and are also suspected of hoarding it in anticipation of higher prices after the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A 90kg bag of maize in neighboring Malawi is being sold at K13,000 while the Zambian farmers are selling at sometimes as low as K5,000 a bag.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Does the government have 15 million bags of maize in its food reserves or is it relying on what we are supposed to bring in?&quot; asked John Mbulo, a farmer in Chizongwe area of Chipata.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If so, then the forecast of a bumper harvest is false because we have sold all our maize to traders who obviously want to export,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 1, 300 farmers in the valley have to pay back fertiliser loans to marketing agents but though they are expected to repay two bags of fertiliser with 15 bags of maize on the average, some have failed to hold back the maize needed for repayment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to sell our maize or else the children will starve and not go to school. Neither can we buy clothing, blankets, or travel without money,&quot; said Blackson Tembo, another valley farmer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The agents also want their share of the maize as per agreement. They gave me two 90kg bags of fertiliser and now they want their maize of which I don't have enough,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew Banda, a maize agent through the Cavmont-SGS Fertiliser Fund, agreed that traders were buying maize from farmers at very low prices even before the fertiliser agents got to their farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is sad that these farmers will not have food to last them up to December simply because they have to sell their maize at any price to get some money. The government should not have lifted the ban on exports because unscrupulous traders are now desperate to grab maize from unsuspecting farmers who do not understand the new liberal system,&quot; said Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry Chipata Chairman, Idrisse Mosali, confirmed the low prices of maize saying it would affect the food security of most households in Eastern province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia National Farmers Union President Ben Kapita lamented the state of the farmers in an interview last Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is sad that the country should lose the little food the farmers had managed to grow this year in such a manner. It is time for government to fulfill its promises to the farmer, giving him better roads and protection from such injustices,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Farmers in Eastern Province were expecting a yield of 2.9 metric tonnes of maize for the 95/96 season. Statistics collected by the Eastern Province Cooperative Union showed that the expected yield was the highest in the country followed by Central Province with 2.56 metric tonnes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - Politics bowed to the unifying influence of sports, as Nigerians celebrated Thursday with fan-fare, their country's 4-3 defeat of world champions, Brazil, in the second semi-final of the Olympic soccer tie at Athens, Georgia in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fans in the football-loving west African country warched the crucial encounter glued to television sets or clutching radio sets for live commentaries of the match, which kicked off at 23H00 local time (22H00 GMT).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos, the nation's commercial hub, was electrified with anxiety and great expectation when the match began.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The city of some six million people was almost turned into a grave yard, as the south Americans led 3-1, until 15 minutes to the end of the tension- soaked encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deafening ovation that greeted victor Ikpeba's 78th minute goal, putting the scores at 3-2, had hardly subsided, when skipper Kanu Nwankwo drew level one minute to full time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That crucial goal dragged the match into extra-time, to the frustration of the Brazilians, who had earlier beaten the Nigerians 1-0 in their last group 'D' match a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerians poured into the street in jubilation, dancing and drumming as if the match had been won. The under-23 team did not disappoint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu, sporting his usual number 4 jersey, slotted Nigeria's fourth and winning goal in the fourth minute of the &quot;sudden death&quot; extra-time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That &quot;golden goal&quot; under FIFA's new rule, secured Africa's first ticket for an Olympic final soccer match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nwankwo's goal's, which broke a 28-year-old jinx that had haunted Nigeria against Brazil, heralded the actual victory party by the Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guard dogs barked at the reverberating shouts by the jubilant crowds, who drummed, danced and lighted up the skies with fire crackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The perpetual fear of armed robbery in Lagos vanished as youths poured into the streets singing &quot;Ose O, O Se O, O Se Baba,&quot; thanking God for the victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No serious incident had been reported here, although over-excited fans reportedly smashed the windows of two private cars at Mushin, a residential area of Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victory became the talk of the town in all nooks and cranies as many workers picked their way late to the office Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Summarising the jubilant mood of the nation, soccer fan Kasali Adeoye, an accountant with a Lagos based company said, &quot;nobody expected the equalizer, at least, not against Brazil. It is a great achievement for Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To many Nigerian soccer fans, beating Brazil seems a miracle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian media reflected this much in their jubilant analysis of the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After transmitting the match, the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria devoted some 30 minutes to what it called &quot;victory conference,&quot; taking telephone calls from different parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nation's vibrant press also refused to be outdone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the game continued until one A.M. Nigerian time, most of the national dailies reported the event in their front pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The private Concord newspaper called it the 'Miracle of Atlanta '96', while the Guardian said 'Nigeria Shocks Brazil, Goes For Gold'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Digging into history, the mass circulation semi-official daily times said 'Nigeria Breaks 28-year Jinx', in a reference to the fact that Brazil had always beaten Nigeria in soccer since their first meeting in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian squad will take on Argentina in the final of the Olympic soccer Saturday, for Africa's first silver or gold in Olympics soccer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am glad that I realised a dream I have been nursing since 1988 and I do not mind even if I stumbled to get it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her bronze has moved Nigeria from the 58th to the 50th spot on the medals table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Falilat Ogunkoya got Nigeria's first bronze in the women's 400 metre race.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia Friday clinched her first and only Olympic medal at the on-going Centennial Games in Atlanta, a silver, won by 400 metres hurdles specialist, Samuel Matete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He finished the race seconds behind gold medalist and long-time rival in the event Derrick Adkins of the United States, who romped home in 47.54 seconds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is Zambia's second Olympic medal in almost 20 years. The country first obtained an Olympic medal at the 1984 Los Engeles games when a boxer, the late Keith &quot;spinks&quot; Mwila, won a bronze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete, a professional runner based in United States, has lost 22 times to Adkins in their 37 meetings in the 400 metres hurdles over the past five years. The Zambian has won 15 of the events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia had taken a 10-member team, four boxers and six runners to the games.  Only Matete offered prospects for a medal and had been widely favoured by pundicts here to lift the gold this time around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete's victory was received with less enthusiasm in Lusaka where soccer is the number one sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Good luck to Matete, the guy should be happy for the silver...but we (Zambians), are looking forward to a gold at the 1998 world cup finals in France,&quot; said Chandwe Chibuye, a marketeer at the city's centre market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His sentiments seemed to wrap up the general lack of particular interest in other sports, other than soccer in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Nigeria pulled the biggest upset at this year's Olympic Games beating hot favourites and World Champions Brazil 4-3 in an exciting semifinal football match on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trailing 3-1 with 18 minutes to go before the end of the match, Nigeria produced an amazing comeback to beat the hot Brazilians in sudden death extra time and shatter the South Americans' hopes of winning a first Olympic soccer gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the widely watched match game, played before 78,000 fans and millions of TV viewers, it was Nwanko Kanu who sealed the victory for Nigeria with a left- footed shot to the right corner of the net just four minutes into extra time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanu had also scored late in the game to make 3-3 in regulation time and force the overtime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brazil scored early, with Flavio Conceicao sliding a free kick through the wall in the second minute of play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Nigeria refused to succumb and soon Celestine Babayaro broke free, crossing the ball from the end line, where it went off defender Roberto Carlos' foot into his own goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minutes later, Brazil pulled away once again, with World Cup sensation Bebeto scoring off a rebound from the Nigerian goalkeeper. Bebeto then helped make it 3-1 in the 37th minute with a neat pass to Conceicao.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria squandered a penalty in the 63rd minute when Augustine Okocha's shot was stopped by diving Brazil goalie Dida. Nigeria continued with its assault on the Brazil's goal and Victor Ikepebai made it 3-2 in the 77th minute after a pass from Daniel Amokachi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With time running out, Taslim Fatusi pushed a ball through a mass of defenders to Kanu, who powered it past Dida in heavy traffic for the equalizer. And four minutes later, Kanu was the hero with the winning goal and end the game. The new extra time rules states that the first team to score in extra time wins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Nigeria, the 1994 African champions who pulled out of the 1996 African Nations Cup for political reasons, a victory on Saturday against Argentina would make it the first African team to win a major senior world soccer title.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - Now only one man, Samuel Matete, can give Zambia an Olympic medal this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete is only one race away from the cherished medal after qualifying to the 400 meters hurdles finals at Atlanta's Olympic Stadium on Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But teammate Godfrey Siamusiye's chase for gold ended Wednesday after he finished 10th in the second heat of the 3000 steeplechase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the top five finishers and the next best two in time qualify to the finals in steeplechase.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fackson Nkandu who was expected to run in the 5000 meters did not participate. The other athletes, Ngozi Mwanamwambwa and Charles Mulinga lost in the preliminary rounds. Three of the four boxers made it to the second round where they lost, leaving Matete as the only Zambian in contention for a medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete, the former world and commonwealth 400 meters hurdles champion earned a place in the final with lackluster performance in the semifinals, coming third in his heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although he led most of the way, he apparently slowed down and relaxed in the last 10 meters in a move to conserve energy for the finals set for Thursday night at 8.25 p.m. (U.S. Time, which will be Friday 02.25 hours Zambian Time.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 400 meters hurdles, the top four finishers in the two heat qualify to the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Calvin Davis of United States won Matete's heat clocking 47.91 with Everson Teixeira of Brazil coming second (48.28) and Matete clocking 48.28 for the third position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete's biggest challenge for the gold, American Derrick Adkins, also made it to finals by winning his heat easily in 47.76. Others who qualified for the finals include Sven Nylander of Sweden, Fabrizio Mori of Italy, Eronilde de Araujo of Brazil and Rohan Robinson of Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Siamusiye, who came second in the the first round, the semifinals proved hard and he faltere behind American Marc Davis who won the heat in 8: 26.76. Siamusiye was clocked at 8:37.41.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other track and field event, Hezekiel Sepeng won silver medal in men's 800 meters, becoming first black from South Africa to get a medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After his time of 1 minute, 42.74 seconds shattered the South African record, he draped his nation's flag around his shoulders and paraded around the stadium - the first black person from his country to ever do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sepeng lost to Vebjoern Rodal of Norway, who won the gold in an Olympic- record 1:42.58.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American Michael Johnson put himself in position to make golden history in the 200 meters, after qualifying to the finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson cruised through the first two rounds of the 200 meters, the event in which he set a world record here last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He won the 400 meters in Olympic record time Monday and can become the only man to win both events in the same Olympics if he triumphs. To do that, he has to beat Frankie Fredericks of Namibia, the only man to have beaten him this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another bid for an Olympic double ended when Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia dropped out before the start of the first round of the men's 5,000 meters with sore feet. Gebrselassie, who won the 10,000 on Monday, had been a favorite in the 5,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But American women hot favourites, Gail Devers and Kim Batten, fell short on the track. Devers, winner earlier of the 100 meter dash, finished a fading fourth in the 100-meter hurdles, failing in her bid to double, and world- record holder Batten settled for silver in the 400 hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Batten couldn't catch Jamaica's Deon Hemmings, who won in 52.82, only a few ticks off Batten's world record of 51.69.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wasn't a good day for Sergei Bubka, world-record holder in the pole vault. He pulled out of qualifying with an Achilles tendon injury and said, &quot; obviously, the Olympics are not for me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bubka, who has set 35 world records, failed to clear a height in Barcelona.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the tennis courts, Lindsay Davenport defeated fellow American Mary Joe Miami to make the women's singles final. She will meet Spaniard Aranxta Sanchez-Vicario for the gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indonesia's Rexy Mainaky and Ricky Subagja rallied to beat Malaysia's Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock 5-15, 15-13, 15-12 to win the men's badminton title.  Indonesia and Malaysia are badminton powers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deng Yaping of China won the women's table tennis singles title, giving her two gold medals for the second consecutive Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And away from the playing fields, another member of the Olympic family defected. Iraqi weightlifter Raed Ahmed, who carried his national flag in the opening ceremony, ran out of the athletes village, was picked up by an Iraqi opposition group and asked the U.S. Immigration and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naturalization Service for asylum. Four Cubans have also asked for asylum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 188 of 271 events concluded, the Americans led with 72 medals, 27 gold.  Russia trailed with 45 medals, 21 gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This came to light at the basic human rights tribunal organised by Oxfam at Lusaka International School.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oxfam Representative in the country, Ms Lucy Muyoyeta disclosed that 76 per cent of the country's population live in poverty adding that this hinders development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mongu - The government has been requested to provide a Zambia Air Force chopper for the transportation of polio vaccines to some parts of Lukulu district when the second round exercise resumes before the end of this month throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The request was made by the Western Province polio immunisation co- ordinating committee, which met in Mongu yesterday under the chairmanship of the area permanent secretary, Mr Tebuho Muliokela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report which was tabled before the committee from Lukulu medical authorities indicated that there is absolute need for the ministry of health to negotiate with the government for the provision of a ZAF chopper to ferry polio vaccines to Lukulu west where roads are impassable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In another development, the committee was also saddened to learn that areas of Kaungamashi and Kaunga-Lweti have not been covered in the first immunisation exercise which took place from July 19 t0 21 because of transport problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mr Muliokela directed Senanga district health management team director to ensure that children in those two areas are vaccinated against polio any time now before the second phase of the campaign starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, according to reports from the six districts of the province, a total number of 135,339 under-five children and slightly over that were immunised but the permanent secretary called for extra hard work to ensure that this figure is exceeded by a wide margin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the committee was startled to hear that during the just-ended immunisation campaign, a team of some medical personnel travelled all the way from Mumbwa boma and carried out the exercise at the TBZ's farm number 10 in Kaoma district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permanent secretary directed provincial medical officer, Dr Albert Sitali to take up the matter with his counterpart in the central province in order to avoid the already existing confusion.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS, United States (PANA) - Nigerian technical adviser, Jo Bonfrere, has described the country's 4-3 victory over Brazil in the semi-finals of the olympic soccer event as a sign of maturity of African football.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere told reporters after the match, played in Athens, U.S., that there was no longer any gap between a &quot;good-playing team&quot; like Brazil and a team from Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now the gap between the good playing teams and African and Asian teams is very close and it is now a matter of tactic and how the players themselves approach matches,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Dutch coach said his team encountered a lot of organizational problems which, he said, disturbed its preparations for the tournament, recalling that five days to the start of the competition, he didn't have all his players in camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But I talked with the team before this game. I told them to forget all the problems for one-and-a-half hours and then, after this game, we can start with new problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere said that skipper Nwankwo Kanu had not played well in the competition because he reported late to camp, but said that he had decided to forgive him &quot;because he made the final goal today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Brazil's lead cut to 3-2 toward the end of the match, Kanu struck in the 90th minute to force the match into extra time. He scored again four minutes later to ensure Nigeria's first-ever qualification for the olympic soccer final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Nigerian sports minister Jim Nwobodo says the players have shown, by Wednesday's victory, that they are indeed a &quot;dream team&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only great teams achieve this kind of feat,&quot; the minister, emerging from the players' dressing room, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He described the match as miraculous, saying &quot;nothing can be better than this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chairman of the Nigeria Football Association (NFA), retired air commodore Emeka Omeruah, said the outcome of the match was &quot;like a dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian football authorities had pulled all the necessary strings to motivate the country's Olympic soccer team for Wednesday's semi-final match against Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two days to the match, the players were all paid their match-winning bonus (for match against Mexico) of 5,000 U.S. dollars each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the players were moved into a hotel in Athens, venue of the match because the accommodation in the city's olympic village was said not to be conducive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Omeruah promised to do whatever was necessary to put the players in the right frame of mind for clinching the Olympic soccer gold on Saturday, against Argentina at the same venue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - As cases of wife battering continue to hit headlines, some gender-conscious men in Zimbabwe have teamed up to lobby against domestic violence and bring harmony in households.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men's Forum for Gender, founded in March 1995, has now set up branches in the capital, Harare, and the towns of Bulawayo and Chitungwiza. There are plans to open offices in the midlands city of Gweru soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum, also known as 'Padare' in Shona and 'Enkundleni' in Ndebele, Zimbabwe main national languages, proposes to offer a counseling service for husbands who do not feel at ease in the presence of strange women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National convener Jonah Gokovah says the social system in Zimbabwe benefits men more than women because of attitudes which have not been questioned over the ages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As men we have to learn to develop the consciousness that there is something wrong with the way we were brought up and try to change ourselves,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are many men who appreciate the situation, but because of cultural pressure they keep their thoughts to themselves. When they are with their families they slide back to their old lifestyles.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gokovah says that at the group's meetings, members are provided with an environment which enables them to speak about gender issues, and become clearer in their minds about where they stand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group held its first public meeting here on July 13, and the next one is scheduled for Chitungwiza. Eventually, the group plans to take the message of gender equality to the rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe, gender equality has always been associated with women, and they have since played a very important role in bringing awareness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some non-governmental organizations have welcomed the formation of the forum as a step in the right direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If they want to assist, we welcome them,&quot; says Eveline Chikovore of the Musasa project that offers a marriage counseling service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Women's action group director, Selina Mumbengegwi, hailed the group as one of the best contributions men have ever made to the struggle for gender equality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a group of men which saw that in society men and women should support each other,&quot; she says. &quot;Men working together will help each either.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gracious Women's Fellowship International representative, Idah Chikono, says husbands have since been incorporated into their counseling sessions together with their wives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are attending to something like six couples a day,&quot; she says. &quot;At times the queue is so long we hardly break for lunch.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chikono attributes domestic violence in Zimbabwe to financial hardships and pride which makes women refuse to accept husbands as heads of families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Couples start off at the romantic stage and pass on to the realistic stage when each reveals what he or she really is,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the most crucial stage, and once they pass that one they can get on to the creation stage. At this point the two of them have decided to stay together.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cases of domestic violence are increasing as Musasa project alone has counselled 603 couples in 1994 and 699 in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leading the list have been wife beating and forced sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Men's forum on gender underplays violence which is perpetrated by women against men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe men being beaten by women is not a social problem,&quot; says Harare coordinating committee member, John Vekris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe many causes of women attacking men is a response to a history of abuse and oppression. We understand men are the culprits, but there is a possibility for them to change. It is not abnormal to move towards gender consciousness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a strong feeling that education plays a crucial part in changing attitudes, members have been addressing schools and colleges on the issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya (PANA) - The Kenya parliament has passed a motion recommending life imprisonment for HIV positive rapists and those convicted of deliberately infecting others with the virus that causes the incurable AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the attorney-general, Amos Wako, had to contend with an angry house Wednesday, because a majority of the members of parliament (MPs) had recommended the death sentence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government adviser in law, however, amended the motion to read &quot;life imprisonment&quot;, instead of &quot;death sentence&quot;, to the disappointment of the law makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MPs were united in their concern about the rapid spread of the AIDS menace and anger at those who deliberately infected others. They also criticized courts for handing out lenient sentences to rapists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving the motion, the MP for the central Kenya constituency of Ndaragwa, Mwangi Gichuki, had sought a mandatory death sentence for rapists proven to carry the HIV virus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His seconder, John Munyasia, from a western Kenya constituency, said the death sentence would reduce rape from HIV positive rapists. He equated HIV- positive rapists with murderers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Aids must be discussed as a national calamity,&quot; Munyasia said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other MPs urged the attorney-general to consider castration of the HIV rapists. The attorney-general rejected the proposal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sudan rejects any decision on imposing a ban on the Sudanese air companies, &quot; Tahir said in a statement issued through the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban is reportedly under consideration by the United Nations Security Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Such a resolution would be unjust, biased and unfounded,&quot; the agency quoted the as saying Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two months ago, the Security Council imposed diplomatic sanctions against the Sudan for its alleged involvement in an attempt to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa in June 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assassination attempt was made as Mubarak arrived in the Ethiopian capital for the annual OAU summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also threatened further sanctions in case Khartoum fails to cooperate with the OAU on the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sudan defended itself, saying none of the suspects was within its territory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese minister appealed to international aviation organizations to prevent the imposition of an embargo on his country's airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the Sudan Airways, which was allegedly used by one of the accused to escape from Ethiopia to the Sudan, was not responsible for scrutinizing passengers before they boarded on its planes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argued that it was not the mistake of the airline if the suspect managed to pass all the Ethiopian security undetected and was able to fly from Addis Ababa to Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline should not be blamed for the mistake of others, the minister added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique issued here Thursday, after a two-day meeting between Nigeria's Minister of Works and Housing, Maj.Gen. Abdulkarim Adisa, and his Benin counterpart, Sahidow Nadey, said the two countries agreed to enumerate and assess all buildings, structures and other properties within the said corridor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two countries share a 770-kilometer (1,232 miles) long land boundary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The communique said the positions of eight pillars along their common borders were yet to be resolved and that both governments should abide by a 1912 colonial document on the boundary demarcation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It called on the two nations to equip, fund and provide suitable vehicles urgently, to facilitate the demarcation of the borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditional rulers of the border communities were urged to sensitize their subjects on the demarcation scheme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adisa explained to the border communities that the demarcation scheme was designed to stem border disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Neither of our two countries is interested in expanding its frontiers to the detriment of the other,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - With 90 minutes between them and Africa's first Olympic soccer gold medal, Nigeria's under-23 squad can afford to go for broke in Saturday's final against Argentina, going by the huge capital of goodwill that has greeted their 4-3 elimination of Brazil in one of the semi- finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superb performance put up by the Kanu Nwankwo-led Nigerians against &quot; mighty' Brazil, make Saturday's encounter against Argentina, another tested south American team, look ordinary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, however, does not undermine the resilience of Argentina, whose senior team beat Nigeria 2-1 in the 1994 World Cup finals hosted by the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brazil's defeat by Nigeria has remained the talk of the town with the west Africans already looking as good as champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They appear well motivated to clinch Africa's first Olympic soccer gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the unprecedented five million naira (about 60,000 U.S. dollars) which the Nigerian government proposed to give them if they win the gold, the players have been enjoying enhanced match bonuses -- 5,000 dollars each for eliminating Mexico in the quarter-final and 7,000 dollars each for shooting down Brazil, which has never won an Olympic soccer gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Nigerians want to outdo each other in a donations galore to help the team bring the soccer gold to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businessman and sports enthusiast, Aliko Dangote, of Dangote Group of Companies, has donated one million naira or 12,000 dollars to the squad and promised another five million naira, (60,000 dollars) if they win the gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian premier league club owner, Jude Ezechukwu has given 500,000 naira (6,000 dollars), with another pledge of undisclosed amount if the team triumphs over Argentina Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More donations are likely to follow, going by the enthusiasm aroused by the players' performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general feeling is that the players will give Saturday's encounter their best, with the knowledge that the country, the continent and indeed, lovers of African soccer are behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one Nigerian commentator, &quot;silver is assured, but gold is the ultimate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commending the players, Nigeria's Information Minister, Walter Ofonagoro, said their exploits &quot;demonstrate the Nigerian spirit, to show his class when you think he is down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers have suggested that the country apply the same spirit in solving its lingering political problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - American business operations in South Africa are increasing at twice the rate of those of all other foreign companies combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is disclosed in the latest survey by the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey covered 2,000 multi-national organizations with direct investment, employees or non-equity links with South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the main findings of the study was that a total of 57 percent of all new companies which have entered South Africa over the past two years have been from the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995 alone, the number of American companies with direct investments or employees in South Africa grew by more than 25 percent, from 208 to 262. The value of their assets rose by almost 30 percent and the number of their employees in South Africa increased by 33 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a grand total of close to 900 foreign companies involved in South Africa, this means that more than 25 percent of this number come from the United States. More than 80 percent of the American contingent are based in the rich Gauteng province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey also reveals that of the nearly 900 multi-national companies operating in South Africa, almost a quarter have entered the manufacturing sector; 21 percent are in the wholesale trade and 20 percent are in transportation and communications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These companies, according to the survey, have responded to South Africa's recent economic growth, as well as regulatory changes which have made some sectors more open to foreign competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is testimony by George Moose, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Trade August 1 on current economic conditions across Africa and the Trade Initiative proposed by Democratic Representative Jim McDermott of Washington and Republican Philip Crane of Illinois, the panel chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXT: We appreciate the emphasis that you and Congressman McDermott have placed on the role of trade and investment and on the private sector as the engine of growth. You and other members of the African Trade and Investment Caucus have stimulated an important debate which will command our attention for some time. While we may take exception to some aspects of your proposals, we support the central thesis: more needs to be done to promote greater private investment and economic integration in Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICA AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President, in his February 1996 report &quot;National Security Strategy of Engagement and Enlargement,&quot; stated that the strength of our diplomacy, our ability to maintain an unrivaled military, the attractiveness of our values abroad -- all depend in part on the strength of the American economy.  Through its own initiatives, and building on those starting in earlier administrations, the Clinton Administration has had considerable success in engaging the United States economically abroad and opening foreign markets through enactment of legislation implementing both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and start-up of the World Trade Organization (WTO); active leadership in the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum; hosting a Western Hemisphere summit in Miami where 34 nations of this hemisphere committed themselves to negotiate a free trade agreement by 2005; and efforts to promote a U.S.-E.U. Transatlantic Marketplace and advance an OECD Multilateral Investment Agreement (MIA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bilaterally, the Administration concluded a Framework Agreement covering our economic relations with Japan, market access and intellectual property Memoranda of Understanding with China, and many other accords with major trading partners. Our trade agenda has been ambitious, proactive, and successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, what about Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAUNTING PROBLEMS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa is undergoing a major transformation. The clearest indicators of this transformation are the growth and expansion of democratic governments paralleled by significant economic reforms and liberalization. Africa's problems, however, remain daunting. Africa is the only region of the world where poverty is expected to increase during coming years. Too many African countries still struggle with civil strife, high population growth rates, an impoverished human resource base, large debt burdens, and minimal investment flows.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thirty-five of Sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries are still classified as low-income, with a per capita GNP of $700 or less in 1994.  Twenty-eight countries are classified by the World Bank as severely indebted. Much of Africa is not fully integrated into the global economy; about one-third of the region's countries are not yet members of the World Trade Organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIGNS OF RENEWED GROWTH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are, however, many positive signs. Apart from a handful of countries experiencing civil unrest, most countries in the region are achieving at least a degree of progress toward sustained economic growth through more efficient use of resources. These positive signs offer hope about the future of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After four years of decline or stagnation, average real GDP growth in the region increased to 3.8 percent last year, the highest rate so far in the 1990s. That was also the first increase on a per capita basis (1.1 percent) since 1989. Growth also appears to be more widespread, exceeding 3 percent in nearly 30 countries. A number of reforming countries have recorded growth rates exceeding 4 percent. Botswana, Ghana, and Mauritius among others have been good performers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While this in part is the result of higher commodity prices, which may be transitory, it also reflects the positive impact of more effective development programs, better economic policies, political transition in South Africa and other emerging democracies, and greater civil peace in some areas, all of which should make economic growth more sustainable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These gains would not have been possible without a firm commitment to economic and political reforms. While recent results are heartening, the progress is fragile and economic reform must be continued and deepened if it is to be sustained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are significant differences in performance among the countries in the region, and, for most of them, higher rates of growth are needed to bring about significant poverty reduction. In South Africa, the region's largest economy, growth improved for the second consecutive year to 3.4 percent in 1995. Even faster growth is needed to reduce high levels of unemployment among the black majority and improve delivery of public services to them. This will require action to improve labor market flexibility and to reduce concentration of ownership in industry. Just last month, South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel presented an economic blueprint of strategies to promote export growth, create a stable environment for investment, encourage privatization, reduce government spending, develop human resources, encourage industrial development, and modulate wage demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outlook in Nigeria, the second largest economy, is much more troubling.  In 1996 per capita income there fell to approximately $260, the same level as 1972 before the oil boom or less than one-fourth the 1981 level. The domestic political situation is volatile, with growing international pressure on the military regime. Within the last few months we have seen halting attempts at economic reform, such as the introduction of a market- based exchange rate for private sector transactions, reduction of import tariff rates, removal of restrictions on foreign direct and portfolio investment, and increasing budgetary transparency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Efforts to revive privatization have begun with focus on telecommunications, power, and the petroleum-related sector. However, Nigeria needs to build a credible track record to generate international support for its reform program. There is still much to be done, but Nigeria has recently reengaged a technical-level dialogue with the World Bank to discuss a plan to implement reform policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CFA franc zone countries in West and Central Africa, which realigned their currencies in 1994, have contributed to the higher African growth rate.  Exports generally responded well to the boost in competitiveness and there are signs of an increased intra-CFA trade, primarily through increased imports of coastal countries from inland.  In East Africa, implementation of structural adjustment policies and high commodity prices boosted growth in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.  Some of these countries are in a position to make significant progress in exchange rate and trade policy reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SPECIAL PROGRAM OF ASSISTANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Economic performance in some thirty African countries has been boosted by the World Bank-coordinated Special Program of Assistance (SPA), launched in December 1987. The SPA brought together the World Bank, the IMF, the African Development Bank, and bilateral donors in an effort to mobilize fast- disbursing assistance and provide debt relief for countries adopting programs of stabilization and structural reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most notable progress has been in liberalizing trade and foreign exchange regimes, and in most countries there also has been solid progress in reforming domestic markets. Several countries have undertaken parastatal reform and privatization, albeit much less rapidly and less completely than needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestic resource mobilization remains a problem in most countries.  About half the SPA countries have made clear improvements in expenditure management, but stronger financial management remains important for all.  More priority needs to be given to health, education, agriculture, and basic infrastructure. Public sector resource problems are complicated by low savings rates in nearly all parts of the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Special Initiative on Africa has identified debt relief as crucial to sustainable economic growth for Africa. The recent meeting of G-7 leaders reaffirmed the importance of supporting economic reform by urging action on multilateral debt and by supporting continued financing of an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has already provided extensive debt relief for Africa's poorest countries. In the early 1990s, we forgave over $1.1 billion ($1,100 million) in concessional debt for 19 of the poorest African countries implementing reforms. In addition, beginning in 1994 the United States joined other Paris Club governments in offering to reduce non-concessional debt owed by the poorest, reforming countries.  Finally, the United States has worked closely with the World Bank and the IMF to address the issue of multilateral debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SIGNIFICANT TRADING PARTNER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States has an important economic stake in Africa's success.  As other panelists discuss in more detail, two-way trade between the United States and Africa last year reached a new high, $18 billion ($18,000 million), 11 percent greater than in 1994. The United States' exports to Africa increased 23 percent above the 1994 level, to $5.4 billion ($5,400 million). Already, the African market is nearly as large as those of the Newly Independent States, including Russia, of the former Soviet Union.  During 1995 the United States imported $12.6 billion ($12,600 million) from Africa, mainly oil, a 12 percent increase from 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISAPPOINTING INVESTMENT RESPONSE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A vibrant, growing private sector is crucial for improving economic growth and living standards. Unfortunately, the investment response -- both domestic and foreign -- to reform measures in Africa has been disappointing.  During the early 1990s, investment flows into Africa stagnated while those to other developing regions, notably Asia and Latin America, increased.  Africa's share of foreign investment flows declined from 8.9 percent in 1981 to only 2.9 percent by 1994, according to an International Finance Corporation study. Moreover, 70 percent of investment flows into Africa in the early 1990s were concentrated in oil-exporting countries, mainly Nigeria.  Weak financial sectors, poor infrastructure, a relatively unskilled work force, macroeconomic instability, and unpredictable legal and regulatory systems have contributed to this result. Consequently, export growth in Africa has lagged (behind) the growth of world trade and African exports remain highly concentrated in primary commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his six trips to Africa, the late Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown worked tirelessly to promote trade and investment with Africa and the growth of the African private sector, an approach to which Congressmen McDermott and Crane have brought increased attention.  Secretary Brown was a most effective spokesman, who brought Africa to the attention of U.S. business and increased the interest of potential African business partners in dealing with the United States. As Secretary Brown often pointed out, if the risks of doing business in Africa are higher than in many other places, the rewards, in the form of average rates of return on book value of 25 percent, are among the highest in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. POLICY ACTIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Clinton's first report to Congress last February on his Trade and Development Policy for Africa contained over 60 specific initiatives being undertaken to increase trade and investment in Africa. We expect subsequent reports to refine existing initiatives and to develop new ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From 1990 to 1994 the United States provided $13,600 million -- an average of $2,700 million per year -- of assistance to Africa, directly though USAID (including the PL 480 food assistance program), and indirectly through the World Bank and other international institutions. These assistance programs have played an important role in promoting trade and development. And they must be continued. Ghana is an example of how U.S. support, including USAID's Trade and Investment Program, has yielded impressive results. Non- traditional exports increased significantly, including manufactured Afrocentric items for the U.S. market. At the same time, our exports to Ghana have increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USIA also plays a role in developing trade with Africa through a variety of programs which encourage the political, social, and economic climates necessary for increased trade and investment. This year, 270 African entrepreneurs will visit the United States as part of USIA's exchange and visitor programs. Young African entrepreneurs and business people will intern in American companies in the United States while U.S. lecturers and researchers will teach and work in Africa, explaining the advantages of free- market economics. USIA programs in Ghana and Nigeria help develop business associations there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the past three decades there have been a number of approaches to development. The conclusion to be drawn from this experience is that development needs balance; the development stool has several legs. There are several things that donors are doing well. We need to retain support for macroeconomic reform -- that is the base for the rest. We also must continue capacity building and human resource development, with particular attention to the education of women. If we forget these basics, we are in trouble.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are other things that have not been done as well, that need to be improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- There should be a stronger focus on the role of trade and investment and on strengthening of the African private sector as the engine of growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- We encourage increased regional economic integration in Africa in order to achieve economies of scale necessary to attract investment.  There has been much talk of the importance of this, but progress has been more limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">-- We need better ways to coordinate and collaborate among donors.  There have been improvements, but more must be done to use declining resources to the best effect.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To ensure continued progress, African governments and international donors must use all resources efficiently. In this era of declining donor resources, the stewardship of available funds is a top priority.  Realistically, we cannot expect an increase in overall donor resources, including from the United States. However, the United States is committed to working with African governments and other donors to direct our resources where they can make the most difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, foreign aid from the U.S. and other donors could not begin to finance rapid economic growth on the continent. Most of the capital needed to finance rapid growth must come from the private sectors, both from within Africa and from abroad, including flight capital. Continued program lending to support economic reforms remains important. However, where economic reform has produced the necessary stability in external accounts and fiscal balances, scarce development dollars can be directed to highest development priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States and other Western donors have been impressed with the resolve that African governments demonstrated in supporting reform of the African Development Bank. The strong support that the regional members have given to the new bank president's reform program is more recognition that shrinking assistance must be used wisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENABLING ENVIRONMENT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.N. Special Initiative states that &quot;donor-led development is not a credible option.&quot; We concur. Increasing and sustaining the rate of growth enough to reduce poverty requires African ownership of the development program. This must be widespread. Governments must strive to muster support from groups benefiting from reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African leaders now must shoulder the responsibility of furthering economic liberalization, developing enduring institutions, mobilizing domestic resources, forging dynamic partnerships with the private sector, protecting the environment, and promoting regional alliances.  African leaders have largely abandoned the practice of blaming others for their troubles; instead, to a remarkable degree, they have become brutally honest in examining their policy shortcomings. In our bilateral assistance, we are talking more and more with the &quot;stakeholders&quot; and are pleased with their increasing focus on African ownership of the development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The task for African governments is to create an enabling environment for private sector growth by removing constraints to political and economic freedom and encouraging greater individual participation.  Investors expect good governance. This means: 1) decentralized political activity, 2) accountable and responsible government, and 3) respect for human rights, including a free press that permits a free and open exchange of ideas.  Investors also expect access to a transparent, predictable legal system to enforce contracts and resolve disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USIA's programming in support of free media, civic education and democratic institutions are helping establish the political and social underpinnings for economic reform and growth. This work includes programs in Burkina Faso, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe aimed at helping private radio and television stations there become financially viable, and journalism training programs which promote competitive, independent media and reduced ethnic tensions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">USAID is also working with many of these governments to help them in the process of creating an enabling environment more conducive to economic growth; however, its capacity to deepen and broaden these programs is limited by the fact that USAID's overall budget is constrained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GREATER ECONOMIC INTEGRATION NEEDED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rapid globalization of trade and finance, reinforced by information technology and telecommunications advances, is transforming the world economy. The danger is that Africa may end up on the outside looking in.  While the marginalization of Africa in international markets is a real concern, this can be and must be reversed. African nations must acknowledge that their nations must aggressively compete, and not retreat, as integration into the international economy is a necessary condition for rapid economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regional integration can be a stepping stone to the global economy, but trade within the region has been limited, by historic trade and production patterns, restrictive trade practices, and inadequate transportation links.  Enhanced regional cooperation can be an important step to better integration into the global economy. There are some nascent and encouraging moves in this direction. The United States is working closely with Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries as they move toward a closer economic partnership.  The revival of the East African Community and the reformation of the West African Monetary Union into an economic and monetary union are other encouraging regional developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WAY FORWARD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our development assistance cannot solve every problem. It is no substitute for good government and cannot make up for failed economic policies, but it can make a decisive difference in promoting opportunities for prosperity, democracy, and stability around the world. We have learned many lessons about what works and what does not, and we are generally applying them well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our assistance to Africa must be maintained, especially when so many African countries, from Mozambique to Sierra Leone, are making quiet progress in stabilizing their economies and building democracies.  Further cuts to our aid programs would not just sacrifice ideals Americans support, they would hinder American efforts to strengthen governments which share our views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. is leading efforts of the G-7 to reform the multilateral development banks. But we cannot reap the benefits of those reforms for American interests if we do not shoulder our responsibilities and meet our obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are many positive signs of economic growth and increasing economic and political freedom on the continent. We believe that through increased cooperation and more efficient use of available resources we can help further Africa's positive transformation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - Following is the prepared testimony of Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA) before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Trade on August 1 regarding legislation he is co-sponsoring with Rep. Philip Crane (R-IL) to encourage U.  S. trade and investment with Africa through the creation of a U.S.-Africa Free Trade Area by 2010, a U.S.-Africa Economic Cooperation Forum, and a U.S.- Africa Trade and Investment Partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TEXT: Thank you for allowing me to testify on a subject that has received far too little attention. I want to compliment Chairman Crane for including sub-Saharan Africa in his review of U.S. trade policy and for his strong and determined leadership as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade. I look forward to working with you and Congressman Rangel to build a vibrant and economically rewarding relationship with sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">My presentation today will focus on two issues -- first, I will give you my view of U.S. trade policy toward sub-Saharan Africa -- and second, I will describe a new initiative to expand trade and investment between the U.S. and those economies in sub-Saharan Africa that are committed to economic reform and supporting private sector growth.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first and most important thing that one must say about U.S. trade policy towards sub-Saharan Africa is that there is no U.S. trade policy towards sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I realized two years ago, during the process of adopting the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, that we had no policy and no real interest in expanding our trade with sub-Saharan Africa. It was very clear in 1994, that we did not have a comprehensive and focused approach there. I decided to offer an amendment that I hoped would begin a serious debate and reevaluation of our approach to sub-Saharan Africa. The amendment that I offered in 1994 directed the President to develop a trade and development policy for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. That amendment -- section 134 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act --- was passed by voice vote in the House and the Senate.  Fourteen months later, on February 5, 1996, President Clinton submitted his response. Unfortunately, the President's response fell short of our minimum expectations. There has been no debate or serious discussion with the administration, no reevaluation, no creative thinking about a new, more productive engagement as buyers and sellers as opposed to donor and recipient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, masquerading as a trade and development policy are an assortment of programs and initiatives that don't work well together, have no central focus, policy or direction. A compilation of programs and initiatives that are trapped in a Cold War and almost paternalistic approach to sub- Saharan Africa. A very good example of this disjointed approach is Vice President Gore's Binational Commission with South Africa. This commission is a prime example of the administration's disjointed approach to sub-Saharan Africa. While I support the intent and the goals of the commission, I can't help but ask the question: Where is the policy that drives this commission and how does it relate to the other countries in sub-Saharan Africa who have struggled with structural adjustment programs and economic reform programs without any substantive response from the Clinton administration? Does the Vice President's plan offer the same help to Ghana, Uganda, and Cote d'lvoire, to name a few, or is this approach just for South Africa?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I recommend that you read the President's trade and development policy for the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, submitted to Congress earlier this year, and the unbiased evaluation of that report by the Congressional Research Service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Chairman, I believe that Africans are responsible for their future, but I think because the U.S. -- the world's largest market and most vibrant economy -- lacks a creative and comprehensive trade policy towards sub- Saharan Africa, we have failed to provide the kind of constructive relationship that would make that future brighter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In summary, I believe that U.S. trade policy with sub-Saharan Africa must be based on building institutional ties with the economies and leaders who are committed to the necessary economic and political reforms that support private sector growth and vitality. I also believe that our trade policy must help to open U.S, markets, technology, management expertise, and capital to sub-Saharan Africa's vast potential. We cannot simply rely on traditional development assistance. Traditional development assistance is only one part of what the U.S. needs to be doing in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, traditional development assistance has been our dominant response to Africa for over thirty years. I believe that it is time for a major shift in attitude, policy and commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal that I will describe to you today is in response to the growing number of African governments and entrepreneurs who prefer to have America's trade and investment, not just our aid. Our proposal rejects the old donor/recipient model for every country in sub-Saharan Africa. Our proposal creates a transition path from development assistance to economic self-sufficiency for countries committed to political and economic reform and strong support for the private sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This proposal takes a very non-traditional approach to sub-Saharan Africa.  Despite Liberia, Somalia, Rwanda, and Burundi, I believe that a growing number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa are reasonably good investments. To use a Wall Street term -- I am bullish on Africa's potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite all the problems, expanded trade and investment with sub-Saharan Africa -- if done right -- can mean a reasonable return on investment, increased per capita incomes, and substantial job creation. I think that it is time the U.S. changed its approach to sub-Saharan Africa. It is time the U.  S. changed its attitude about doing business in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To do that, we must build an institutionalized relationship and policy based on strong trade and investment ties with those sub-Saharan African countries that have taken on the difficult job of political and economic reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is not to say that they have gotten everything right, that reforms have worked in every country, because in many cases they have not. But I am saying that if you're ready to make the necessary economic reforms, then the richest economy in the world should be willing to help the poorest economies make the transition from aid dependency to buyer and seller in the international marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Africa's efforts at self-sufficiency should not go unsupported. Now, the question is, what is the best way to do this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, I believe that the U.S. can do more for those African economies committed to economic reform through our markets, our management expertise, our capital, and our technology, than we could ever do through our limited and shrinking aid programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In March of this year, we formed the bipartisan African Trade and Investment Caucus to develop a congressional policy on trade and investment with sub-Saharan Africa. As you may know, Congress is not well suited for this type of job. It has been difficult, and I don't profess to have all the answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me start out by addressing the greatest misconception about this proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I do not propose to cut health, education, population programs, democracy initiatives, conflict resolution support or child survival funding to fund this proposal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that there are a number of African countries who will continue to need traditional development assistance as they struggle to develop civil societies. Our aid dollars and programs are important to them and I support funding for these efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, my proposal is designed to create a comprehensive trade and investment strategy for those economies in sub-Saharan Africa who have a record of commitment to market-based economics and to supporting their private sector -- we want to tie those economies to the U.S. economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While I have had discussions with African ambassadors in Washington and they have communicated to their governments, this proposal lacks a very important element, and that is substantive input from African business leaders and governments. I can only say that in politics, one must take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves. It is rare to be able to do all that you should do. So I view our effort as a good beginning.  I welcome the constructive input from all interested parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I invite your input as we go through the legislative process and I want to tell you that Africa has a new set of friends in the U.S. Congress. There are many, both Republican and Democrat, who want to see a different, more productive, and mutually beneficial relationship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now let me describe our proposal. It is composed of three primary cornerstones and several key initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first cornerstone is the negotiation of a U.S.-Africa free trade area by 2020. A few African countries have begun the difficult job of integrating into the global economy. Many African countries have become signatories to the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the difficult work begins of removing tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. The free trade area gives us the opportunity to begin the process of bilateral and multilateral discussion that, over a number of years, will lead to the type of economic and trade relations that are mutually beneficial to Africa and the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Obviously, this will take some real creativity and commitment, but we think a U.S.-Africa free trade area is fundamental to our overall trade and investment strategy. We expect that these negotiations will begin with very small steps in the direction of a free trade area and that the negotiations will explicitly recognize the huge differences in the various economies. But it is our hope that we can jointly craft an institutional framework that is satisfactory to Africans and to the U.S.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We are outcome-oriented, we want to support the kinds of policies that expand trade and investment, that generate jobs in Africa and the U.S., and that strengthen economic ties between the U.S. and Africa. By making a commitment to reach a free trade area in 25 years, we think that we have a chance to be successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The second cornerstone is the creation of a U.S.-Africa economic cooperation forum. This idea is loosely modeled on APEC. Until Secretary Brown visited Africa earlier this year no Secretary of Commerce had been there since 1982. Can any of you think of the last time a Secretary of State or Treasury paid an official visit to any country in Africa? It has been a long time since any Cabinet member has had to think of Africa other than as a recipient of donor aid, or as a humanitarian basket case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Forum will begin to change that way of thinking about Africa. The Forum will meet annually to lay out an agenda that will allow for bilateral and multilateral initiatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There will be opportunities for private sector and NGO participation. The Forum will be the place where issues and concerns can be discussed at the highest levels. The Forum will demonstrate to the international community that the United States takes Africa seriously. That we want to expand and enrich our economic ties with Africa. That we are in for the long haul and will compete with the Europeans and the Asians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is my hope that the Forum will also send a signal to our business community that the U.S. government is committed to making it easier to do business in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third cornerstone is the U.S.-Africa trade and investment partnership.  We propose a $100 million partnership program to support privately managed equity, and infrastructure funds that will leverage private financing for small and moderate-sized African businesses. A growing number of equity and portfolio funds have been created for Africa over the last three years. We believe that Africa's needs require more sophisticated financial instruments and approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our funds will do three things: first they will help mobilize private savings from developed economies for equity investment in Africa; second, they will stimulate the growth of securities markets in Africa; and third, they will improve access to third-party equity and management advice for Africa's small and medium-sized firms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We want to attract American technical and managerial expertise to financially feasible projects in Africa. Doing business in Africa is difficult and expensive; we have to find ways of making it attractive and efficient to look at not only the great business deal, but the financially feasible deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The demand for infrastructure in Africa is enormous, but the response from the international finance community has not been promising. Our infrastructure fund will be the first created for Africa. We are beginning to see a number of African governments increasingly opt for construction and management of infrastructure projects through the private sector. The size, complexity, and uncertain profitability of such projects have, in the past, discouraged many U.S. investors from participating. But it is clear that Africa's future competitiveness depends on reliable telecommunications, roads, railways, and power plants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By creating an infrastructure fund we hope to be able to attract U.S.  investors to potentially profitable projects. The Asian infrastructure fund is one example of the kind of impact that we think this fund could have in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The principal goal of our three cornerstones -- the free trade area, the forum, and the partnership program -- is to attract the international project finance market to Africa, and to make it financially feasible for U.S.  investors to participate in profitable business opportunities in Africa. If we can do that, we will see substantial job growth, increases in per capita incomes, and expanded trade between the U.S. and Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some may think that this is naive, overly optimistic, or just completely unrealistic. Well, I think that it is time that someone was optimistic about Africa, that someone was willing to challenge the status quo. That's what we intend to do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the three cornerstone programs will take time to implement, there is one initiative that could have an immediate impact in at least three or four African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African textile and apparel exports to the U.S. represent less than 1% (about $350 million) of the total import market of $43,000 million. We have drafted a policy that could be implemented immediately and would not threaten U.S. jobs or disrupt our domestic industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specifically, we are proposing that there be no adverse actions taken by the U.S. government to restrict any textile or apparel from sub-Saharan Africa from entering the U.S. prior to the aggregate of such trade exceeding $3,500 million annually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This policy shall be applicable to sub-Saharan Africa until the multifiber agreement expires in 2005. Over the life of the multifiber agreement, this represents about $32,000 million in potential exports to the U.S. and generates jobs and tax revenue for Africa. To put this initiative in perspective, the U.S. has given $25,000 million in foreign aid to Africa over the last 34 years. Of course, we support the application of international labor and human rights standards as this proposal is implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just about all emerging economies have historically used the textile and apparel sector as an entry point to manufacturing. Once workers build up skill and dexterity in garment production, they are generally ready for the introduction of new manufacturing industries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the equity and infrastructure funds and the textile and apparel initiative, I am proposing two changes in how the board of directors of the Export-Import Bank operates. First, the composition of the board of directors will have to include one person who has extensive private sector experience in sub-Saharan Africa. Second, the board of directors are required to establish a private sector advisory committee to assist in developing and implementing policies, programs, and financial instruments designed to support the expansion of, and increase in, the provision of loans, guarantees, and insurance with respect to sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I believe that these two initiatives will help the Export-Import Bank to expand coverage beyond the nine countries currently eligible for financing without violating generally accepted credit standards. I want to emphasize that I am committed to coming up with financially responsible procedures that will allow the Export-Import Bank to do its job in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1994, the cumulative value of export financing guarantees, insurance, and loans for sub-Saharan Africa was $25.8 million, or 0.2 percent of total Export-Import Bank financing. I think there are ways to turn this around without ignoring our fiduciary responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is an important priority and we hope to have some positive initiatives coming out of the Export-Import Bank in the next 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I've tried to lay out our proposal, and to give you an idea of the commitment that many of us have to a radical shift in emphasis towards a private sector and market incentives approach to stimulating economic growth and reducing poverty in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This trade and investment proposal is not for all of sub-Saharan Africa. To participate, a country will have to meet eligibility requirements based on a strong commitment to economic and trade liberalization. We propose to move away from &quot;if you reform your economy we will give you development assistance&quot; to a more dynamic response that says &quot;if you liberalize your trade, political, and economic policies we will expand our trade and investment relation with you. We want to create a transition path from development assistance to self-sufficiency for those economies committed to economic reform. At the end of a five- or 10-year period the countries participating in this initiative will be receiving substantially less development assistance because of their expanded trade and investment ties with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will mean that even with our domestic budget squeeze, we would be able to continue to help those sub-Saharan African countries that require traditional development assistance. In fact, there may be more money available since the countries that we will focus on tend to be USAID's priority countries, the ones that tend to get the most money from the U.S.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Major newspaper companies seem to be lagging behind on the issue of black empowerment, focussing instead on doing their bit for affirmative action by training journalists and other staff. Although some print conglomerates have attempted to address black empowerment, others are worried that their affirmative action efforts are not enough to quell the quest by black consortiums seeking a stake in their newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general understanding of real black empowerment is that substantial shares have to, at some point, be vested in black hands. That means that black partners, if they are to be empowered, need to have some clout at management level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Affirmative action, on the other hand, is the bottom rung of the ladder where black candidates are trained in the newsroom as competent reporters and potential editors. But they do not have commercial power in terms of shares and redirecting a conglomerate such as Times Media Limited (TML) or Nasionale Pers (Naspers).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perskor seems to be leading the pack on black empowerment since it jumped into bed with Kagiso Trust Investments (KTI), the financial arm of Kagiso Trust. This means, ironically, that The Citizen, the most notorious of the apartheid-era newspapers, will soon be jointly controlled by Perskor and its black partner, KTI.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KTI is adamant that it will not be a mere black token in Perskor. With its board representation and executive management positions, it intends to be actively involved in decision-making and have some clout when it comes to determining the stable's long-term direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The future of Rapport is uncertain as it is jointly controlled by both Perskor and Naspers, but there has been talk that KTI's interest in Perskor will not necessarily balance the all-white control of Rapport. As Perskor's black partner, KTI has, to some degree, empowered itself. It will not only play a role in the commercial aspects of the newspaper, but will also be involved in the editorial composition of The Citizen. Here empowerment has taken place at the top.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There seems to be consensus in the print industry, as in the advertising sector, that black empowerment has to go hand-in-hand with affirmative action and training. To have control at the top end without the necessary knowledge and expertise of what happens in a newsroom is futile. Furthermore, having black reporters, news editors and editors is useless unless there are shareholders in the upper echelons of management -- shareholders who are representative of changes in the newsroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naspers, which owns Die Burger, Beeld and City Press, among others, is believed to be holding talks with potential black partners in an effort towards acquiring a joint shareholding in City Press. It is believed that Naspers wants control of City Press to go to a black shareholder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joint shareholding or even majority shareholding in a single publication is sometimes not enough, as can be seen from the situation in the Independent group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sowetan is owned by New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) with the Independent as a minority shareholder. The Sowetan has editorial independence and managerial clout as far as the newspaper is concerned; but beyond that, the black partners are powerless and cannot play a role in the overall policy- making or direction of the conglomerate even though that conglomerate has minority shares in the publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Naspers's intention to rid itself of a mainly black-interest newspaper (City Press) and follow in the footsteps of Independent Newspapers may not be enough to address the imbalances in the print media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But should print conglomerates take in black partners who are only interested in the commercial side of operations and not concerned with the basic functions of a newsroom? This throws up the debate of whether newspapers are like any other profit-making businesses and can be run like baked-bean factories where commercial concerns are the only consideration, and the quality of the baked beans of only secondary concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newspapers require a delicate balance between costly editorial needs, which sell the paper, and advertising needs, which bring in the revenue. They usually thrive when they achieve a balance between management's desire to carry as many advertisements as possible and spend as little as possible on the editorial and editorial demands for space and resources in order to produce a good product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence we may end up with a media industry where several black partners have shareholdings in print publications, but, like some of their white counterparts, have no desire to spend money to improve the publications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng Newspapers managing director Deon du Plessis says an important question facing the Independent group is whether it can afford to enter the next century as an all-white company with no &quot;affirmative action candidates&quot; at an executive level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that no one can accuse the Independent of being &quot;static&quot; as it is actively involved in affirmative action. However, when it comes to real black empowerment, the stable may be faltering. Du Plessis, head of the policy committee on affirmative action, says the group is holding ongoing talks with unions and non-unionised staff in a bid to establish company policy. The committee is discussing the issue of affirmative action in management, a matter &quot;high up on the agenda&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Independent Newspapers have embarked on a fast-tracking course at Harvard University to groom black journalists as the country's future editors. But the questions remain, whether this will be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fast-tracking course includes 12 candidates: 10 black males, two white females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Independent group is leading the way in training black journalists, it has not been seen to have embraced black empowerment, other than its joint shareholding in the Sowetan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivor Jones &amp; Roy media analyst Peter Armitage argues that it is difficult for the Independent group to make steps towards joint shareholding as its majority shareholder, Irishman Tony O'Reilly, is offshore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No decisions can be made without O'Reilly's approval. This is similar to the Mail &amp; Guardian's situation where a foreign publication -- the Guardian -- holds a majority of the shares. However, unlike the Argus and the Star, which are large newspapers, the Mail &amp; Guardian is a small publication and the only newspaper in the M&amp;G media group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armitage says there is concern among the newspaper houses as in all white businesses that the future requires a black partner. He believes that the Independent will, in the next couple of years, make a move towards real black empowerment and will not want to see itself lagging behind other stables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TML seems to be at the back of the pack in both affirmative action training and black empowerment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is negotiating with the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) whose talks are being headed by Cyril Ramaphosa, the company has been accused of wanting to stall the process by introducing an editorial charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NEC has also set the tone by rejecting the TML charter and making sure that the transaction is not complicated by any preconditions stipulated by TML management. However, Ramaphosa has made it clear that he supports an editorial charter in principle, but is opposed to it being used as a bargaining tool.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TML is also believed to be having unofficial talks with Pearsons, owner of the Financial Times, in an effort to have its business publications, the Financial Mail and Business Day, jointly controlled by Pearsons and the NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group is clearly uneasy about having a black partner, but at the same time its management realises that a black partner can only bode well for it as it is clear that the road ahead for print media can no longer be vested in lily-white hands alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once the NEC acquires a stake in Johnnic and in Omni Media, the holding and parent companies of TML, it will be in a position to have some clout on an executive level, allowing some balance from a black partner against TML's former custodian, Anglo American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy President Thabo Mbeki also established a task team on communications (Comtask) earlier this year; the team's brief includes monitoring the role the media plays in reporting government issues and evaluating the impact that media conglomerates which are predominantly white, such as TML and others, have on government communications and the impartiality of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team has yet to address the issue of media ownership, but it is clear that the print media has to be more representative of the country. However, representation has to occur on two levels: Firstly, on an executive level and secondly, in the news room itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Five years into an economic reform programme that was supposed to transform Zimbabwe into Africa's answer to the Asian &quot;tiger&quot; economies, Edith Chido is still waiting to see the miracle unfold in Epworth, a dusty settlement a few kilometres from the capital Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They speak of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Programme (Esap) on the radio, promising us a bright future if we suffer some pain now, but I can see no future,&quot; said Chido as she washed clothes outside the one-room wooden shack shared with her husband, their three daughters and the son of a sister who died recently from HIV-related meningitis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until last year, her husband earned about Z$70 ($6,90) a month, working in a textile factory. Then the factory closed. Now the family survives on less than Z$1 a day, which she earns from laundry work in Harare. Meal time is a helping of maize-based porridge or &quot;sadza&quot;, and a watery cabbage sauce.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;More than 70% of the children here are malnourished,&quot; a health worker in Epworth said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Epworth is a microcosm of a wider tragedy unfolding across Zimbabwe. The poverty of more than a quarter of the population is deepening, inequality is widening and unemployment has risen to more than 50%. Those in work have seen their benefits and security downgraded, along with their wages. Their real incomes have fallen by a third since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The pursuit of International Monetary Fund (IMF) budget targets under Esap has eroded the gains in health and education since independence. Health spending per capita has fallen by a third since 1990, bringing one of sub- Saharan Africa's most developed health systems to the brink of collapse. A recent report from Harare city council showed that infant mortality rates have doubled since 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part of the bleak picture can be attributed to Aids, which affects one million people -- a third of the sexually active population. According to the World Bank, treating Aids-related sickness will require a fourfold increase in spending in the next decade, yet health-centre budgets are in terminal decline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In education, real spending per primary school student has fallen by more than 30%, leaving schools to rely on levies and fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the IMF believes Esap has been a qualified success. &quot;The challenge now is to consolidate the gains of the past five years and to accelerate the reform process,&quot; said the fund's Southern Africa representative, Jurgen Reitmar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite this, virtually all of Esap's macroeconomic targets have been missed. Inflation is more than double the 10% target fixed in 1990, real incomes have fallen, the budget deficit has increased, exports have stagnated and manufacturing output and investment have declined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a best-case scenario, it will require annual growth rates of more than 5% to restore average incomes to their pre-1990 levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Bank and the IMF blame Esap's performance on two severe droughts.  But high interest rates, the exposure of fragile industries to competition from imports and the collapse of the domestic market have also contributed.  So has the decline of public investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in the eyes of its supporters Esap's failure is temporary rather than structural. &quot;Everybody must face up to the transitional costs of adjustment if we are to progress,&quot; the deputy finance minister, Misheck Chinamas, recently told parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe is aware of the unpopularity of Esap -- an acronym popularly reinterpreted as &quot;eat sadza and perish&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his election campaign earlier this year he denounced the IMF and the World Bank and promised a more humane reform programme. Today his officials are completing negotiations on a new five-year Esap.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new programme will require the government to cut its budget deficit of 13% to 6% within the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In theory, the budget sustainability could be achieved by restoring taxes on higher income groups and reducing subsidies to loss-making parastatals. In practice, powerful vested interests make this a non-starter. The upshot is that the brunt of the next phase of structural adjustment will be borne yet again by the poor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Amid signs of slower economic growth and continued lower inflation, Sanlam this week launched a gilt unit trust to provide mainly institutional investors with an alternative to equities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior portfolio manager Kobus Louw told a media briefing that the upsurge in share prices after South Africa's re-entry into the world economy had just about run its course and future performance would depend on fundamentals such as earnings growth, economic growth and interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, he expected more sedate growth from equities over the next year or so, while bonds became a more attractive investment option, mainly for institutions and wealthy individuals. The minimum lump sum investment for Sanlam's gilt unit trust will be R5 000 and the minimum monthly cash or debit investment will be R500.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw estimated that South Africa could see growth in the region of 2,2% next year and 3,3% in 1998. But real interest rates remained &quot;very high&quot; to curb inflation, which he expected to be very stable over the next few years at between 7,5 and 8%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'If you believe that inflation will be stable ... it seems as if our long- term and short-term interest rates are at least 1% too high,&quot; Louw said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was mainly because there was &quot;a lot of uncertainty in the market&quot; especially about exchange controls, the rand and the possible retirement of Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, however, there has been a strong inflow of foreign funds into bonds over the last six quarters, &quot;which would not have happened if the stocks were not fundamentally internationally attractive&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted that with all the uncertainty in the market &quot;there is a lot of risk. The new government is just like the management of a company, and the management of a company depends to a large extent on the track record and expertise of the management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In this case, it does not have any track record so until investors absolutely gain some confidence, I do believe that we will see a lot of volatility in our markets.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant it was unlikely that interest rates would come down soon, despite being too high, and this would be a continuing attraction for foreign investors.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Do not unbundle or break up South African conglomerates; rather hit them with heavy fines if they abuse their power, says a United States specialist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Breaking up a monopolist does not necessarily create competition. A small economy might not be able to support a large number of competitors in an industry which requires very large scales to be efficient. It is in these industries especially that low import barriers play an important role,&quot; says Charles Stark of the US Government anti-trust Division.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This controversial advice emerged at a conference on Competition Policy organised by the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut (AHI). Stark said there is a cost to breaking up or restructuring, even though the result will always be different for different markets, so it is important to consider alternatives that might be effective in restoring competition at a lesser cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, he warned, effective and ongoing anti-trust enforcement is vital. &quot; Collusion among competitors, price fixing, bid rigging or market division can give rise to monopoly outcomes even in markets that appear from the number of firms to be competitive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tony Twine of Econometrix was suspicious of any legislation aimed at sorting out a complex problem. &quot;It's so easy to duck and dive. No country has ever relied on the use of any one mechanism; it is often the combination of different approaches that works the best,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he welcomed the possible further liberalisation of exchange controls as having far-reaching potential in levelling the playing field by enabling foreign companies to challenge the domination of the South African economy by a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, historically, it has been very difficult for a foreign company to buy into a local pyramid structure and at the same time there are not as many local interests (including blacks) who can buy into these pyramids at market value, says Dr Pierre Brooks, South African Competition Board chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In the context of both the re-integration into the world economy and the need for new competition laws in line with the rest of the world, we must aim to prevent the concentration and abuse of power which can subvert free enterprise.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He supports the broad range of internationally accepted competition and anti-trust measures, as well as the concept of imposing huge fines to curb the abuse of power by dominant entities in the market place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that opinions were sure to differ on whether competition law should take cognisance of or address important ethical, social and political issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such difference of opinion was aired by National African Federated Chambers of Commerce (Nafcoc) executive secretary general Mashudu Ramano, who said: &quot;From our perspective we want to be co-owners, co-producers, co- creators and co-sharers in the wealth that we jointly own and produce.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ramano said competition policy should be more vigorous, pro-active, robust and strong and should meet the following tests:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* It should deter negative trends, but not discourage beneficial competition and co-operation;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Be easy to administer and not impose excessive burdens on industries;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Provide swift, effective and fair remedies to injured parties;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Provide strong punitive measures to serve as deterrents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Spicer of Anglo American, meanwhile, called for an holistic policy to ensure that the state's dominance of the economy through the monopolies it controls is also changed. Markets are more effective in resolving most problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Thebe Investment chair Vusi Khanyile called for South Africa's new laws to be structured to benefit the stimulation of the growth of small, medium and micro-enterprises. He maintained the present trend tended only to create new small black conglomerates such as Rail, New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) and others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said even the company he headed had already become a small conglomerate, although this was not the intention. &quot;We have had to keep some companies in our stable alive beyond their actual lifespans just to protect the reputation of Thebe, typical of one of the ways conglomerates add to anti- competitiveness.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Newly appointed Portnet executive director Sipho Nyawo had an unusual brainstorming session in Cape Town this week to help him map out what should be done to the giant port authority to meet the needs of burgeoning post-apartheid trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Held only four weeks after his appointment and including representatives from as far afield as Hong Kong, Britain, Germany and New York, the conference provided Nyawo and his top officials with a unique opportunity to tap into sometimes conflicting views on port management, whether ports should be privatised or not and the role of unions in keeping ports operating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hong Kong-based Ahrenkiel Liner Service Limited managing director Peter Nash said the previous, white management had not made vital decisions about upgrading facilities such as container terminals to meet increased traffic flows after the first all-race elections in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cross-fertilisation of ideas at the conference would help Portnet have a better informed view when making these and other important decisions, Nash said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo, who has trained in ports around the world, said that although he had had some experience in Portnet before his appointment, he realised that he needed to consult fairly widely to get a better grip on the issues, pitfalls and challenges facing him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards, he said the experience had been worthwhile and he planned a follow-up conference with the same delegates a year from now to measure progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The initiative was welcomed by the local and international delegates, even though, as Wolf Arlt of the Port of Hamburg put it, there was some initial suspicion about the purpose of the meeting. But that soon dissolved &quot;and we had a really good discussion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the infrastructure and staff at South Africa's ports need urgent attention is well known. Unprecedented flows of imports and exports all but clogged the major ports last year and labour unrest has often ground one or other port to a halt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, as Safmarine managing director Tony Farr pointed out, productivity is not as high as it should be. Security has also been a problem and Nyawo said a top priority would be to beef it up with the help of Felixstowe port officials in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo said part of the problem had been the &quot;us and them&quot; approach of previous (white) management, the lack of communication between port officials and their clients and inadequate training and poor staff relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the conference, delegates identified certain key areas that needed attention and Nyawo said that he would be appointing an advisory group to help him deal with the issues raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The key areas included port regulation, improved client relations through a national stakeholder forum, improved tariff and pricing policies, security, productivity and training, a more participative management approach to infrastructure development and improved marketing of ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo also announced that Portnet would spend more than R950-million in 1996/97 to upgrade South Africa's ports to handle increased traffic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The upgrade would include a new quay at Richards Bay, a new terminal at Saldanha Bay and new grain elevators at East London and Port Elizabeth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also hinted that major new developments would be announced &quot;in six weeks' time&quot; to improve container handling facilities in the two Eastern Cape ports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference also gave Portnet a chance to air the controversial issue of whether it should be privatised or not. Delegates heard about the ports of Hong Kong and Felixstowe, which were privatised and highly efficient and Singapore port which was government-owned, but was moving towards privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union representatives at the conference reiterated their opposition to privatisation, but said that if the present restructuring agreement indicated that this was what was needed, &quot;we will address it when it comes&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyawo said he was also awaiting the completion of the restructuring exercise under the National Framework Agreement, but that he had been encouraged by the &quot;practical&quot; approach of the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues that were discussed included the development of hub ports to serve the region and whether the development of the Maputo corridor would not take traffic away from South African ports.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The petrol price is expected to drop 8c/litre from Wednesday in the wake of a stable rand for most of last month and a softening in international fuel prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Motorists would have enjoyed a 9,5c a litre decrease, but it is understood Transport Minister Mac Maharaj has taken advantage of the favourable fall and secured a 1,5c/l increase in the levy on the fuel price which feeds the state accident insurance fund, the Multilateral Motor Vehicle Finance Fund (MMF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's regulated fuel price includes various fuel levies, fixed margins for retailers and wholesalers -- the rest of it is based on movements in international fuel prices and the fate of the rand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMF levy on the diesel price is expected to go up 1c/l, while the diesel price itself will drop 4c/l in line with currency and price movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Transport Department could not be reached for comment, but it is understood the decision took place after consultation with the Minerals and Energy Affairs and Finance ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has complained that the MMF is heavily in need of cash to meet outstanding claims. Maharaj is planning a controversial revamp to the way the state accident insurance scheme works. He is proposing a &quot;no-fault&quot; scheme, which the MMF will administer as there will no longer be a need to prove negligence. For actuarial reasons, the scheme is expected to cost much more, and will require several increases in the levy. In the draft White Paper, Maharaj works on the assumption the levy will stand at 12c/l from May.  The latest increase has brought the levy to 10,5c/l.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the fuel companies were hoping the government would take advantage of the drop to increase their wholesale margin, which has remained static for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transnet economist Mike Schussler said the collapse of the rand should rule out a decrease next month.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Johnnic board will have to be substantially restructured once the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC) secures control of Anglo American's 48% stake in Johnnic, valued at R2,5-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood there are no &quot;major stumbling blocks&quot; to the talks with Anglo American, but that the key issue occupying the NEC is grappling with its own internal restructuring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just who will be chosen to serve on the Johnnic board is a matter of contention. The select few will have to be chosen from several ranks within the NEC coalition, which consists of about 40 black businesses and trade unions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, New Africa Investments Limited (Nail) and Worldwide Africa Investments are the most powerful in the coalition and will play a key role in the decision-making as they are the only two believed to have the financial backing to fund their percentage of the Johnnic stake.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Likely candidates for the Johnnic board include Nail chairman, Nthato Motlana, Worldwide chief, Wiseman Nkhulu, chief executive of Nail, Jonty Sandler, and NEC chief negotiator and Nail deputy chairman Cyril Ramaphosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current board has eight members of whom at least half will have to go, depending on what stake is owned by the NEC. The likely candidates to remain and serve their time as board members are Johnnic chief executive and chairman of both Omni Media and Times Media Limited, Vaughn Bray, Clem Sunter of Freegold and Mayer Kahn of South African Breweries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some industry sources have said it is premature to speculate on future board members, while others say it is timely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After almost two-and-a-half years of talks, the two parties last week allegedly reached consensus on some broad principles of the deal, including a more flexible approach to pricing by Anglo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The details of pricing have still to be negotiated; the NEC wants the stake at a discount price, while Anglo is holding out for a market-related price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some analysts have, however, argued that Johnnic's intention to reshuffle its media interests may push Omni Media, stakeholder in M-Net, M-Cell and Nethold -- a massive European broadcaster -- out of the reach of the NEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ivor Jones Roy media analyst Peter Armitage disagrees with this speculation, saying that the reshuffling will not push up the price as the NEC is interested in Johnnic and Omni Media automatically forms part of the Johnnic package. Five percent of Nethold, which is now owned by Omni Media, is valued at about R800-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglo American representative Michael Spicer could not be reached for comment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Massive dollar buying at home and abroad -- not his impending resignation -- was behind the rand's plunge to record lows against the deutschemark and sterling this week, says Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mostly it was foreign banks seeking to cover their positions and bailing out of the rand,&quot; says Stals. &quot;There is still some nervousness in the markets.  The danger in the present situation is that it attracts more and more speculators and becomes more difficult to control.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We must get some stability back into this market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That looked a long way off, as the rand traded at R7,006 against the pound and DM0,3274 at the time of going to press. The danger now is that the money market shortage, already at about R8,5-billion, will worsen further, putting unwelcome pressure on interest rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals was philosophical: &quot;The Finance Minister (Trevor Manuel) and I are monitoring the situation closely. Obviously we would prefer rates to remain unchanged, but if the situation deteriorates further, there may be no alternative. Let's hope the market stabilises before that becomes necessary.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sudden storm in the currency markets after the relative calm of the past two months exposes the underlying concerns about South Africa, whether it be over fears of Stals's resignation or uncertainty over the government's ability to implement its growth strategy in the face of trade union opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is perplexing,&quot; says Stals. &quot;What more can I do? I have reassured the markets time and again that I have absolutely no intention of resigning, yet they keep riding this horse. But the rumours feed into foreign fund managers' broad uncertainty about the economy, exacerbating the volatility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The shift in emphasis from the domestic market to foreign players, who fear the worst if Stals quits, is worrying. &quot;The attitude among the international banks is 'Better the devil you know',&quot; says an analyst. &quot;From a foreign point of view, for Stals to quit would be a disaster. They see the dollar easily going to R5.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Azar Jammine, chief economist at Econometrix, concurs: &quot;Stals's resignation is an important factor in the currency weakness, but in addition, as long as the government is committed to doing away with exchange controls and fails to act, the markets will continue to test the level at which residents will not be tempted to take their money out. At a rate of R4,50 to the dollar, a nest-egg overseas is still attractive; at R5 it may be less so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals disagrees: &quot;Speculators will always push a market if they see a chance for a quick profit. Foreigners understand this; they advise us to go slow. We must be careful and not act too hastily.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the short term at least, it's &quot;fasten your seat-belts time&quot;, says Nick Barnardt of BoE NatWest. The current account deficit results in a daily shortage of dollars, and while in theory interest rates and the currency have moved sufficiently to correct the trade gap, there is always a time lag, with the danger that the exchange rate overshoots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are into a risk period now. Things may become considerably worse than necessary to reach equilibrium.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Hezekial Sepeng's success in Atlanta and the rave reviews he is now receiving provide a stark contrast to the response his performances drew last year and serve to underline just how fickle top class athletics can be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only last summer after all that Athletics South Africa (ASA) president Leonard Chuene growled grumpily that Sepeng's head was too big to fit through the door. And throughout 1995 Sepeng was exposed to continual hounding from certain sections of the media, firstly because he didn't break the 24-year-old national record every time he laced up his spikes in South Africa, and also because he failed by the narrowest of margins to qualify for the world championships 800m final in Gothenburg.This year, however, Sepeng kept a low profile and put in the necessary groundwork to do the business when it really counted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That groundwork was laid in a new environment in Johannesburg after moving from Potchefstroom last October and with a perfect training group which included teammate Johan Botha and British Olympian David Strang.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The three of them were a perfect combination,&quot; says Sepeng's coach since he started out in athletics, JP Van der Merwe. &quot;Johan had speed and David endurance because of his 1 500m background and the training sessions they were doing were superb.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Equally important for Sepeng though was the change he made in the structure of his training programme for Atlanta which came about as a result of a book given to him by another British athlete training at his Rand Afrikaans University club. Barry Durn gave him a copy of Running for Glory by Peter Snell of New Zealand who won the 800m at the 1960 and 1964 Olympics along with the 1 500m on the second occasion. The book explained the training methods of Snell's legendary coach Arthur Lydiand and his emphasis on endurance training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With encouragement, Sepeng started doing long runs once again to build up his stamina. &quot;Hezekial was never fond of long runs. When he stayed at the school hostel in Potch I used to drop him off 7km away every morning to make sure he did them, but once he moved into his house he stopped doing them,&quot; says Van der Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accustomed to the relentlessly flat landscape of Potchefstroom, Sepeng hated running in the hilly surrounds of his new home in Auckland Park, but he got used to it and was soon running 40 minutes a day during his winter programme with weekend runs of up to two hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crucial factor in Sepeng's success though was that he focused his training and performances on Atlanta rather than the domestic season. Sepeng tapered down to race only twice during the local athletics season, mainly to get a qualifying mark due to unclear signals from ASA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the second of those races he ran a personal best of 1:44.96, a remarkable performance considering that he did no specific training to sharpen up and didn't veer away from his endurance base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the clearest indication possible that Sepeng was right on target for the Olympics but again the media thought he was not up to scratch whenMarius van Heerden beat him to the South African record in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van der Merwe was not concerned though and just before they left for Europe at the beginning of June Sepeng did a training session on the track which convinced him that he was in great shape. &quot;I knew then that Hezekial was ready for a very fast time,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An injury scare after his first race in Estonia was followed by a steady improvement leading up to his main European race in Oslo. But Sepeng travelled to the South African Olympic training camp in LaGrange bitterly disappointed after his Oslo entry fell through at the last moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was desparate for the chance to produce the fast time his training sessions showed he was capable of and his frustration was increased when he saw that Kipketer and Rodal both went under 1:43 in Oslo.When he arrived in LaGrange, somebody pointed out an old man sitting in a canteen. It was Mal Whitfield the 1948 and 1952 Olympic 800m champion, who spent over 40 years in Africa as a United States sports ambassador and discovered many of Africa's great runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sepeng went to talk to Whitfield and the old man took an immediate interest in him. A few days later he called Sepeng out to his car and showed him his 1952 gold medal. &quot;He rubbed the medal all over me for luck and then said he would come and watch me train later that day,&quot; says Sepeng</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Whitfield arrived at the track he watched for a while and then called Sepeng over. &quot;He told me my left arm was moving sideways when I was sprinting and said I must practice my arm action in front of the mirror when I got back to my room.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That weekend Sepeng went to the Gold Rush track and field meet in North Carolina for his last warm-up race before the Games. He went into the race treating it as an Olympic heat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was only concerned with winning. In the field were Johnny Gray and Einars Tupuntis of Latvia who had won the American collegiate title earlier in the year. After a relatively slow first lap of 51.35 Sepeng was handily placed behind them as they hit the home straight. &quot;I was afraid I was going to get spiked so I slowed down a bit and moved out ot the third lane. Then I kicked and concentrated on my left arm action, pumping it all the way. I just ran through the line without looking at the clock as I normally do in South Africa,&quot; says Sepeng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was an emphatic victory but the real bonus was his time of 1:43.47. That made him the third fastest in the world over 800m and boosted his confidence at just the right time. The rest is history.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most important thing about Sepeng's superb performance in Atlanta though is the effect it will have on middle distance running in South Africa. There is a huge reservoir of untapped talent in this country which is just waiting to be unleashed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Velzian, the coach who got Kenya's awesome running machine up and running, said last year: &quot;Athletics in South Africa is just waiting for a spark which will light the fuse and lead to an explosion. Hezekial Sepeng in Atlanta might be that spark.&quot; Prophetic words indeed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It may sound Irish to disclose that the South African soccer season begins this weekend, five months after the first matches were played.  It also happens to be true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the beginning of the year it was decided to introduce a Premier League, run along the lines of the remarkably successful English Premiership.Another change was an August start instead of the traditional February.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faced with the problem of keeping several hundred footballers active for six months, Coca-Cola bridged the gap by bankrolling a single-round league called the Challenge Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It ended last weekend at Odi Stadium with an exciting 1-1 draw between Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, who failed by two points to catch winners Kaizer Chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Amakhosi are now entitled to represent South Africa in the 1997 African Champions' Cup although lack of sponsorship and quality players may prevent them competing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the Coca-Cola Cup takes centre stage with eight first-round matches spread over the weekend from King's Park soccer stadium in Durban to Odi Stadium north-west of Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final placings on the Challenge Cup standings dictated the draw with first- placed Chiefs meeting 16th-placed Hellenic, second-placed Pirates facing 15th- placed Real Rovers, and so on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, the outcome meant many fixtures around Johannesburg with matches scheduled for Alexandra Stadium, Johannesburg Stadium and Dobsonville Stadium on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The quest for the R200 000 first prize begins on Friday evening in Durban where Manning Rangers host QwaQwa Stars in a repeat of a recent Challenge Cup encounter which produced eight goals and a local victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With Rangers involved goals are almost guaranteed as they slammed nine goals past Crystal Brains in the Challenge Cup just a few weeks after conceding the same number against Chiefs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most attractive of the three Saturday cup ties pairs Pirates, shock losers to Wits in the 1995 final, with unpredictable Potgietersrus-based Rovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Normally, one would not hesitate to select the Buccaneers, but the team are tired from an international and local programme which demanded too much of semi-professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rovers served a warning last month by taking the lead twice against Chiefs in Johannesburg and being deprived of victory by an injury-time goal from former player Mike Rapatsa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vaal Professionals, the only South African club to defeat Pirates in a competitive match this season, host Bush Bucks from Umtata at Zamdela Stadium.  The Sasolburg stadium is renowned for its rock-hard, brown-tinted pitch and an unpleasant smell which drifts across the ground from a nearby steel plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professionals are cock-a-hoop after lowering the Jolly Roger and unless Bucks can reverse a slump in form which saw them drift to 14th position on the Challenge Cup standings, defeat seems likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few hundred spectators are likely at Odi Stadium for the clash of Supersport United and AmaZulu, which is a pity given the potential for a thriller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In theory, this match should be the closest as Supersport finished eighth and the Usuthu ninth in the league phase and there were no goals when the teams clashed in Durban a few months ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiefs may have won the Challenge Cup, but there is general agreement that the present wearers of the black and gold pale when compared with the great teams of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National captain Neil Tovey remains an inspirational guiding force at the back and David Modise and Isaac &quot;Shakes&quot; Kungoane have their moments in midfield.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the goals of Rapatsa and Pollen Ndlanya, the attack lacks class and Amakhosi supporters must dream of the early 1990s when Fani Madida and Shane MacGregor wreaked havoc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday they host Hellenic, probably the youngest Premier League team even if coach Colin Gie is having second thoughts after a string of Challenge Cup losses following a bright start.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Moroka Swallows-Wits match at Dobsonville is a repeat of a first-round encounter last year, which the Students won 2-0 through goals from Warren du Pont and Chris Mwakapuki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swallows showed a welcome return to form recently by holding Pirates in Alexandra after leading for most of the match and defeating Sundowns through a late Andries Mpondo goal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cosmos, the nomads of the First Division with as many homes as they have players, tackle erratic Cape Town Spurs in Alexandra before taking up permanent residence at Pam Brink Stadium in Springs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spurs displayed grit to come from behind and defeat Supersport at Rand Stadium only to give an appaling performance soon after when losing to Pirates in Alexandra.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This could be one of the closest encounters with home advantage offering a slight advantage to Cosmos, the team owned and coached by former national star Jomo &quot;The Black Prince&quot; Sono.Sundowns displayed collective strength when containing Pirates and new coach Reinhard Fabisch faces an equally tough challenge in Bloemfontein against revitalised Celtic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Free State outfit finished fifth in the Challenge Cup, boosted by an unbeaten home record which included only six goals being conceded in nine matches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Should any match finish level after normal time, 30 minutes extra time will be played followed by a penalty shootout if necessary. The winners qualify for the quarter-finals from August 23-25.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the public broadcaster of a developing nation, the SABC was given all its Olympic footage for free. But, not the type to pass up an opportunity to prove its commentators &quot;can match the world's best&quot;, the corporation decided to make up for all the money it had saved by sending no fewer than 86 staffers to cover the Atlanta games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, at least we think they're in Atlanta. According to Dumile Mateza (the man with the accent that makes even Michael Jackson seem black), they're actually in Ahtluntah -- as in &quot;Hello and wellicalm to Ahtluntah&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth is that, for the most part, they could just as well have stayed at home and produced confused, insipid coverage at a third of the cost. We've actually witnessed, in the first boxing coverage to be aired, commentators excitedly declaring how, at the end of a bout, &quot;the red one&quot; produced &quot;a brilliant, impressive fight&quot; -- only to see the &quot;blue one's&quot; arm raised in victory. Now, anyone can make an error in judgment -- but not when the scores were there on screen all along. Someone went all the way to America to offer us less than we already knew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another fine example was continuity presenter Vuyo Mbuli's brief but sensitive insight into the mind of an Olympic high jumper. Finals and all the pressure's on. The athlete steps off the mat, unsuccessful and on the verge of tears; we hear Vuyo: &quot;Oh. He missed. We-ell, he's very unhappy with that.  Very unhappy indeed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or take Tony Frost. Here's a leading athletics commentator -- who never stops to think about what comes out of his mouth. So we end up with lines like: &quot;Carl Lewis. What a legend! When the chips were down he looked at them only long enough to take out a whole new set of chips!&quot; Or introducing Hezekiel Sepeng and Johan Botha: &quot;Two of our young tigers ... no, no, in South Africa we have lions. Two of our young lions ... or cheetahs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Elma Neethling's one of those headgirl-types who's done her research and, though a tad eager, manages to produce the goods. She's also the only woman in a man's world (you can't count Ursula Stapelfeld, last seen simpering in front of an abandoned and very wet beach volleyball court). The problem with Elma is her hair. What could've been a modest bob has been poofed into an alarming mushroom. This hairstyle is scarier than Ilke, the German discus- thrower, scarier than the man with floppy tits in the Vodacom ad -- scarier, even, than a pipe bomb at a reggae concert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of explosions, several moments of silence, please, for Martin Locke. He was actually at the scene of the bomb just three short hours before it went off. And Dorianne Berry, GMSA anchor, wouldn't let us forget it. (Not one to keep her mouth shut, Dorianne also told us how her co-anchor was barred from filming the aftermath -- at the precise moment that CNN's live footage of the scene played off behind her).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But back to Locke. He proved to be one up on the rest of Atlanta who, according to an expert interviewed on CNN, would be waking up in a state of major grief at not having been blown up. He called it &quot;survivor guilt syndrome&quot; and then declared that Atlanta would be needing therapy a good few months on. If that logic applies to local Olympics viewers, best you book into a mental institution right away.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban - In the beginning, the gods gave all the seeds and plants to the animals of the world to grow. Mabuyu was given to the hyena, who unfortunately was very last in line, and he was so upset he planted it upside down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is one of the &quot;traditional&quot; texts found beneath Ian van Coller's stark, simple images, on view at the Durban Centre for Photography. Indigenous folklore and bizarre, singular objects that stand out in the African landscape are Van Coller's passion; and he incorporates them into his art through photogravure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African-born artist (25) is based at the Segura Publishing Company in Arizona, where he collaborates with female and minority artists, as well as others whose work seeks to demystify America's Wild West. He uses an old camera similar to those of 19th-century travelling photographers, and devours 19th-century and early 20th-century books on African exploration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this exhibition, Van Coller examines how colonial and neo-colonial views of Africa differ from traditional African perspectives. Each image, printed on to Japanese silk tissue &quot;reflecting the fragility of the African landscape&quot; , is accompanied by two texts -- one folkloric, like the tale of the hyena and the Mabuyu tree, the other &quot;scientific&quot; colonial writing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Coller doesn't attempt to hide the fact that his is a white South African point of view -- &quot;I've grown up having to define and quantify everything, imposing my will on everything. The colonials did that in Africa.  Their approach to human beings in Africa was the same as their approach to nature, very scientific&quot; -- but tries to deconstruct stereotypical views of Africa through the juxtaposition of texts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The two sets of text that are placed under each image represent the two world-views. On the left the traditional, and on the right the Eurocentric, scientific view. The intention is to create a collision between the two world- views ... I like the idea of creating this dialogue, because I want dialogue to take place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Coller is influenced by African-American artist Carrie Mae Weems, who deals with race and gender issues, and roots his work in contemporary African- American feminist literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the signature devices of his photographs is to &quot;cut off&quot; people's heads. &quot;When reading 19th-century explorer books I was perturbed that photos of African people had no reference names to identify who they were. I strongly believe that, as soon as you put a person's face into a picture, you have to name them, otherwise you're dehumanising that person. So I have decided to focus on plants or animals as an intermediary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I use plants because they're really important to people in Africa. I travel a lot and it's interesting how Europeans perceive the land compared to black people.&quot;-0-</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Launching new music into South Africa's notoriously conservative market isn't easy. So, you ask youself, is the B&amp;W label entirely sane to mix new music with an equally innovative marketing strategy?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Very much so, according to the label's South African frontman, British-born Colin Charles. &quot;South African music is headed to be one of the top world musics internationally. It should also be making it at home -- the problem is that the music biz here still works through what are essentially apartheid structures.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">B&amp;W's South African stable stretches from the deep folk roots of Mandla Kunene and Dizu Plaatjies to the outright modernism of Moses Molelekwa and Zim Ngqawana, taking in veteran pioneers like Sipho Gumede and Pops Mohammed along the way. This week, the label launches a tour by Barungwa, an Anglo- African collaboration whose core comprises Molelekwa, vocalist Max Mntambo, UK drummer Andrew Missingham and reed-player Chris Bowden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group's sound is grounded in club beats and Bowden's fiercely &quot;out&quot; sax playing, melded with distinctively South African keyboard riffs and vocal lines. It labels itself &quot;African futurist jazz&quot; -- but the effect, for those with memories long enough, is reminiscent of Malopoets: a reminder that all kinds of modernist intellectual seeds were sown back in the Black Consciousness era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barungwa's tour is focusing on the townships; the main airplay for the album is coming from the community radio stations, and you're likely to be offered the cassette by an independent seller working the township taxi ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Charles justifies his approach: &quot;There's no chance for people living in the townships to get to hear new music. Travel to city-centre clubs is expensive and difficult in the evenings, and there are no well-stocked music shops in places like Alex and Orlando.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With reference points in semiotics and linguistics, Charles compares the development of cultural trends to a viral takeover, with personal contact, example and word-of-mouth recommendation as the carriers. &quot;A small start and sustained effort can make an impact in the communities where most people live.  There's a brilliant music audience out there that cuts across generations; incredibly well-informed, able to discuss styles and solos. It's appalling that they're so poorly served.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's also, however, an element of needs-must in the B&amp;W strategy, given the dismissive attitude of national radio DJs to new and not easily pigeon- holed musical styles. &quot;If a track is longer than five minutes, and not on a station playlist, it's hard to interest national DJs,&quot; he says. &quot;And I have to say that some DJs gave me the distinct impression they were looking for kickbacks before they'd consider our music.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Whereas the community radio DJs understand African music, know what their audience like, and will play it. It'll be tragic if commercial pressures push them towards the playlist approach in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And if the strategy doesn't work? &quot;Look, the music's world-class. Its world sales demonstrate that. Part of the post-liberation trend has to be developing self-love for your own culture.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It would be difficult to imagine a more tranquil scene: the Harare Gardens in early August; the first hint of summer as temperatures climb; the scent of jasmine and the tinkle of fountains. This is the placid setting for the annual Zimbabwe International Book Fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But behind the serene exterior of one of Africa's premier publishing events, a bitter controversy rumbles that threatens the future of the fair. It is also proving an important test case for Zimbabwe's emergent civil society. A statement by the government's Director of Information Bornwell Chakaodza banning the participation of gay rights group Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (Galz) -- to preserve what he called the nation's &quot;cultural health&quot; -- precipitated the crisis.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first the book fair organisers, who last year succumbed to government pressure and withdrew their invitation to Galz, held firm saying Chakaodza's injunction had no basis in law. But they proved no match for the Board of Censors which this week issued an order prohibiting Galz from attending, citing laws relating to the display of &quot;undesirable&quot; literature and a breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Galz has pointed out its literature -- which the Board of Censors had not even seen -- was drawn up by academics and church groups and concerned legal and constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was nothing graphic, let alone pornographic,&quot; said Galz administrator Keith Goddard. &quot;And if there was a breach of the peace it would have been the result of the government inciting its supporters to violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ruling Zanu-PF party MP, Tirivanhu Mudariki, recently called upon supporters to rally against Galz. &quot;If Galz attempts to exhibit at the book fair, the party has the capacity to mobilise all its members to demonstrate against it,&quot; he said in what many observers saw as a menacing move given the record of political thuggery held by the Zanu-PF Youth League and its women's league.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another group, Sangano Munhumutapa, which is sponsored by a prominent black empowerment spokesman who sits on Zanu-PF's fund-raising committee, threatened to burn down the Galz exhibit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday Galz secured a High Court ruling declaring the Board of Censors's ban null and void, and restraining it from interfering any further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But observers doubt whether the board will be deterred from trying again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the government's stance has been cheered on in the state media and by religious zealots, it has been roundly condemned by human rights groups and lawyers who claim the government is acting outside the law and in defiance of Zimbabwe's constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Chakaodza told the Mail &amp; Guardian he knew when he issued his directive that a statutory instrument of some sort would come to hand. &quot;At the time the ban was issued, I knew a legal instrument was going to back up that ban.&quot; he said referring to the Board of Censors's edict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers have accused the government of jeopardising the book fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We will have to reconsider our future attendance,&quot; said Peter Ripken, representative of the Frankfurt Book Fair -- the world's largest. Referring to what he called &quot;the climate of intimidation and censorship&quot;, Ripken said &quot; Zimbabwe will soon become a pariah state like Nigeria if they go on like this.  Why come here when our books may be banned, when our stalls will not be protected from government- instigated mobs?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Publishers' Association of South Africa is not represented at the fair because of last year's ban of Galz. But individual publishers who are attending spoke out against the latest move to eject Galz.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Juta's representative Gavin Cutler said it would have &quot;a negative effect on future participation&quot;. The government's &quot;gross intervention was an abnormal abuse of its host status&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Witwatersrand University Press's Francois McHardy pointed out that the government move was shortsighted: &quot;This fair is a big boost for the economy.  The hotels are full. How would all the vendors and craftsmen feel if the book fair were to fail? People have to realise that intolerance is actually going to affect them economically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year Galz stood isolated as President Robert Mugabe successfully divided the country's fledgling civil society with his harsh condemnation of homosexuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace has described the government's ban on Galz as &quot;unjust discrimination&quot; and ZimRights has said the blanket ban was &quot;a violation of the right to free expression and equal treatment under the law&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Book fair executive director Trish Mbanga said this week she was pessimistic about the future of the fair following the government's ban on Galz. She regretted all the attention it was getting, she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbabane - Swazi King Mswati III has bought an R8-million hotel in Mbabane at a time when the homes of many of his subjects are being repossessed by Swaziland's banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the price and the provenance of the hotel have attracted controversy.  Businessmen believe the king has seriously overpaid; the Mbabane city council has assessed the property at R3-million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the fact that the king bought the Castle Hotel in his personal capacity was kept secret for weeks, until it surfaced coincidentally in a court case earlier this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The manager of the hotel had accused millionaire property developer Kal Grant -- at that time believed to own the hotel -- of harassing her, and charged him with trespassing. It was revealed during the case that followed that Grant had sold the hotel to the king.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The king owns a great deal of property in his kingdom, including a palace for each of his six wives, and there have been rumours for years of villas in Brunei, yachts in Australia and property in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest deal comes in the wake of countrywide turmoil: months of pro- democracy demonstrations and strikes, including a lengthy teachers' strike settled only fortnight ago. Last week a contingent of southern African leaders -- President Nelson Mandela, Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, Botswana's President Ketumile Msire and Mozambican President Joachim Chissano -- met the Swazi acting prime minister Sishayi Nxumalo at an &quot;emergency consultative meeting&quot; in Maputo. Afterwards, Mandela said he believed the king would be moving towards democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And indeed, at the gathering of the nation on Friday last week, although the 23-year ban on political parties was not lifted, a constitutional committee, charged with constitutional review, was appointed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And a new prime minister was named: former minister of finance Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini and the executive director of the International Monetary Fund for southern Africa. The last prime minister, Prince Mbilini, was retired summarily in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the land deals continue -- and so do suspicions that the king is too close to wealthy and influential businessmen. The troublesome Malagwane Hill Road, intended to be cut through Grant's property, has been diverted around the hill to avoid it, at a cost of several million rands. Nor is Grant the only beneficiary: the road has also been diverted around the property of the powerful Prince Masitsela, the king's brother.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The huge trucks which ferry copper-rich rubble out of the Palabora Mining Company's (PMC) pit around the clock stopped hauling for a few hours last Sunday morning and the world's second-biggest man-made hole fell silent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event which warranted this break in production was the annual Phalaborwa Open Pit Copper Race in which about 480 participants spiral their way 7km up the crater and then run -- or hobble -- to the finishing line at the company's luxurious Hans Merensky Country Club.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The club, named after the man who discovered the copper in the early 1960s, borders the Kruger National Park. Like the mine area itself, its famous golf course regularly hosts hippo, crocodile, lion and elephant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crowd cheering the athletes as they emerged from the pit included portly, bearded Afrikaners, young white women plastered in make-up and sporting cockerel hairstyles, and lavishly dressed, plump black women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only four years ago Phalaborwa became synonymous with white rightwingers when the khaki cohorts of the Afrikaner Weerstandbeweging (AWB) threatened war in protest at the mine's moves to accommodate senior black employees in the town. It also made a name for itself as a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; base for the South African Defence Force, and the launch pad for cross- border raids into Mozambique in the years South Africa backed Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The verdant town and its two townships -- Namakgale and Lulekani, a Verwoerdian 15km away -- have since developed a serenity untypical of the Northern Province, with its widespread poverty and racial conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military presence has wound down, and any obvious racial tension has evaporated. Fauna Park school, where a principal 14 years ago instructed his white pupils to beat up any black child seen wearing their uniform, is now worthy of a new South Africa postcard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hanging over Phalaborwaians until four months ago, was the fear that PMC -- the town's major employer and a crucial player in its political and social development -- would pack up and leave when it had finished mining its open pit in 2002. But after years of feasibility studies the company, controlled by British mining giant Rio Tinto Zinc, finally decided to go ahead with a 20- year underground- mining project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Property prices have doubled, there are no vacant houses, contractors are moving in to develop the massive project, and entrepreneurs are lapping up the boom-town spirit. Tourism is up 30%, shopping centres are being planned and a Malaysian consortium has bought a patch of land on which it intends to build a five-star hotel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The town's other major employer, Foskor, is expanding and its owner, the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), has expressed interest in piping gas from Mozambique's Pande Fields to Phalaborwa to fuel a steel plant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the race runners' water stops was staffed by Joe Mathebula, a manager at PMC and Phalaborwa's first black mayor. A local businessman said Mathebula was &quot;excellent at public relations for the town&quot;; a teacher called him &quot;Phalaborwa's Madiba&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathebula's political career began when he chaired local government negotiations between the town and the two townships. He says PMC's then- general manager Bruce Farmer made people aware of the potential for local government in the new dispensation and encouraged the negotiations. Two other PMC employees were elected to the Greater Phalaborwa Town Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was after Mathebula's chairmanship resulted in the town and the townships agreeing to become one that he was asked to stand for mayor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I didn't want to stay as mayor after negotiating. I wanted to go back to my relaxed life. But they showed how much trust they had in me and I was honoured by that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathebula has baffled his white colleagues by remaining in namakgale and not moving into town. &quot;I have a natural instinct of siding with the weak,&quot; he says, and that staying in Namakgale has made him a more effective mayor. &quot; Being an industrial-relations officer working for PMC, and working with these communities, I felt it was better for me to stay with these communities. I would then hear some of the things that they would not tell managers ... (if there were) a strike I could come up with a solution because I will know what is happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds his family is well established in namakgale, where his children can play in the street. His parents, he says, would be reluctant to visit him in Phalaborwa itself. &quot;They are from the old generation. After a few beers they like to get out the drums and sing and dance. You can't do that kind of thing in town until people change their attitude.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathebula believes the area's apparently smooth relations between races are not merely skin deep. &quot;No, I do not worry it is superficial. I spend a lot of time in the white community. I go to many functions, sporting events and business meetings where I can see that they (whites) really respect me. It is not only with me. I can see it happening with the rest of the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A University of the North graduate who has been with PMC for 20 years, Mathebula does not like to see himself as a politician. &quot;I am a humanitarian.  Politics gives me the opportunity to speak to people, to talk and to listen, and to see if I can help them. In the mine, when I was in industrial relations, I derived a lot of satisfaction from that job.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He believes the key to Phalaborwa's racial success is the decision to form one town. During the negotiations, the whites initially wanted the status quo to remain intact. They swung around, he says, because he asked them what their fears were -- and was told a lowering of standards, subsidising those who did not pay their rates, a black takeover of town. Not only did Mathebula and other African National Congress negotiators guarantee these fears would not materialise, but they also secured the backing of Northern Province premier Ngoko Ramathlodi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In other areas, the attitude was: &quot;We are in the most powerful position and we take over. Of course, those whites who had their own fears are now surprised that it has worked well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So where did the AWB vanish to? &quot;All of a sudden they are no longer there.  We don't ever hear from them.&quot; He says it is too much to hope any whites will vote ANC in 1999. One prominent businessman, Manie Kriel, has however already made the switch -- - from the National Party -- and is affectionately described as a &quot;turncoat&quot; by another businessman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The streets where Mathebula's children like to play are not like those of the average South African township. There are many destitute patches, but money from PMC -- and the other two main employers, Foskor and Fedmis -- has alleviated poverty in some areas. Some mine houses boast lush, attractive gardens on substantial plots. And, by South African standards, there is little crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phalaborwa police Commander Wanda van Zyl, based in Phalaborwa, says there are about four murders a year in the area -- all in Namakgale and Lulekani, where the quotidian crime is assault. An inspector in Lulekani confirmed her statistics. Van Zyl says most Phalaborwaians own guns -- not so much for self- protection, but to use at shooting clubs. &quot;It's their hobby.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mathebula's wife works across the road from their Namakgale home in a preschool funded by the Palabora Foundation, set up by the company to fund projects in Namakgale and Lulekani. The company pumps 3% of its annual after- tax profit into the foundation, which has built new schools, added classrooms to existing schools, built libraries, and set up small business-development schemes. The foundation also funds the Palabora Reef Training Centre near Johannesburg, which provides training for young people from undeveloped communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation has borne criticism for a paternalistic approach -- that it rushes into plans without adequate consultation with the people it is supposed to help. There were al in the end, who secured an all-inclusive deal with the ANC, whereas Felgate could not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Buthelezi decried the &quot;lack of internal discipline, personal agendas, infighting and undermining of colleagues&quot; which had plagued party structures, he made no reference to the invidious role of Felgate's Portfolio on Constitutional and Legislative Affairs (Pocola), or its electoral failures after wresting control of the election machinery from Jiyane's head office.  Felgate's bungling of the Durban campaign, where the party secured barely 12% of the vote, was not mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Buthelezi recognised the importance of delivery in extending the party's support, he blamed the central government for &quot;emasculating&quot; the province, ignoring the millions of rands in unspent development funds in the province's coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When he cited the need to &quot;cut off dead branches&quot; and said the party must &quot; be driven by leaders with true constituencies&quot;, his comments appeared to be directed at the new breed of white and Indian parliamentarians who had failed to deliver votes -- - partly out of frustration at being told to &quot;march by the generals of Pocola&quot;. His comments did not focus on the tier of traditional deadwood blamed by party moderates for the provincial goverment's lethargy, nor on the clique of rootless white advisers on whom he has relied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jiyane's bold plans to tie power to grassroots work were subverted into the tried-and-failed pledge of the party's old-style stalwarts to &quot;restructure&quot;.  Most of the proposed changes involved a renewed effort by Felgate and treasurer general Arthur Konigkramer to wrest control of party finances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wrapped in this internal bickering, the IFP failed dismally to review the image it presented to the electorate during June's provincial elections.  Greer's Thatcherite Cold War rhetoric failed to convince voters to go to the polls, and his Cosatu- bashing lyrics did not win the party any support among black voters in ANC-supporting townships, but Buthelezi's conference speech still bore Greer's unmistakable influence as he attacked Cosatu for being the &quot;labour aristocracy&quot; responsible for the woes of South Africa's unemployed workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Greer had failed to realise was that most unemployed workers depend on workers -- many of whom belong to Cosatu -- for their survival. In his zest to promote global Thatcherism, Greer mistook African extended families for British nuclear families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until Buthelezi realises that it is the black leaders within his party who are in tune with the electorate, the IFP stands little chance of building a national profile. The best Greer -- or any of the white image-makers whom he has relied on over the decades -- can hope to do is attempt to resurrect the dual personae which earned him international kudos in the 1980s while he was embroiled in a vicious civil war back home. But that will be much more difficult to sustain in an integrated South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - The United States paid Burundi's new military dictator nearly $150 000 over the past three years to promote democracy and peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A significant proportion of the money given to Major Pierre Buyoya's Foundation for Unity, Peace and Democracy was to organise an international conference in Burundi, to include such notable peace-makers as Archbishop Desmond Tutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was scheduled to take place more than a year ago, but it has been repeatedly postponed, supposedly because of the spiralling violence between Hutus and Tutsis which claims about 2 000 lives every month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya -- a Tutsi who was in semi-retirement after an earlier bout as military ruler -- overthrew Burundi's deeply divided civilian government despite warnings from the international community that it would not accept military rule in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madeleine Albright, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, visited Bujumbura earlier this year in an attempt to forestall a coup by saying Washington would not recognise any government that came to power by force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The US administration's misplaced faith in Buyoya is proving especially awkward because the Hutu president he deposed, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, continues to take refuge in the house of the US ambassador to Burundi.  Washington says it still recognises Ntibantunganya as Burundi's legitimate president, but he is clearly an embarrassment as he refuses to leave US diplomatic soil while the Americans try to deal with the man who ousted him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Buyoya promises to restore democracy, he has suspended all political parties and says his regime's priority will be to prosecute Hutu rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya's grants were provided through the US Agency for International Development (USAid) from its &quot;democracy and governance&quot; budget. They total nearly $150 000 since 1994. They paid for Buyoya to travel to South Africa as an observer during Nelson Mandela's election two years ago. The US also funded the major's participation in a conference in Benin on &quot;democratisation and the role of the military&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than $30 000 was given for his foundation to study assistance to Tutsi refugees, when the majority of people who have been forced to flee their homes are Hutus escaping attacks by the overwhelmingly Tutsi army or who have been &quot;ethnically cleansed&quot; from cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the bulk of the money is two grants totalling nearly $110 000 for Buyoya's foundation to study the democratisation of government structures and the judiciary, and to hold the conference. Buyoya's foundation continued to receive grants after USAid director Brian Atwood announced in April that all but emergency humanitarian aid to Burundi was suspended because of the government's failure to reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The European Union did likewise, cutting off budget support which had helped the Burundian government to pay its soldiers and civil servants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A week after Major Pierre Buyoya seized power in Burundi, South Africa is still wondering what to do about it. While Buyoya has been told his government will not be recognised, there is no clear path for South Africa's policy-makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western powers have put considerable pressure on President Nelson Mandela -- most recently during his trip to Britain and France, and during German Foreign Minister Hans Kinkel's visit to South Africa -- to take an assertive lead in African peace- keeping initiatives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this week former African National Congress MP Jan van Eck, speaking from Burundi, said the coup was a &quot;blessing in disguise&quot; and warned that forceful foreign intervention could &quot;terminate&quot; Burundi. Van Eck has been involved in the Burundi peace effort since last year, and is now a consultant to the Cape Town-based Centre for Conflict Resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Affairs spokesman Pieter Swanepoel this week said that while an &quot; escalation&quot; of thought had taken place on the military option immediately after the coup, the urgency had dissipated. He said the situation in Burundi - - where at least 150 000 people, mostly civilians, have died in three years of civil conflict -- was reasonably stable. South Africa's position remained the same as before the coup, when Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said &quot;the stationing of military units is not possible at this time&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Significantly, a meeting of East African regional leaders in Arusha, Tanzania, on Wednesday shied away from resurrecting plans for military intervention - -- deciding rather to impose economic sanctions. While Foreign Affairs has said repeatedly South Africa would take its lead from the Organisation of African Unity and regional groups, Swanepoel said on Wednesday South Africa had yet to formulate a response to that decision.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Signs are, however, that South Africa is to get more closely involved in the East African initiative, which is led by Tanzania's elder statesman Julius Nyerere. Last week Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa wrote to Mandela asking for a South African envoy to that initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Eck said South Africa had a duty to get involved, but warned against the use of force. &quot;Of all the countries in Africa, South Africa would be most welcomed by Burundians. The majority (Hutus) and minority (Tutsis) see the solution we found in South Africa as something they would like to emulate ...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you want to resolve conflict in a country, you have to work with those who are in authority. It doesn't matter how much Buyoya's takeover is attacked, he is in charge. South Africa must find a way to engage him to ensure his commitment to eventual full democracy is adhered to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Without me wanting to justify the coup, Buyoya has committed himself to the same path as in 1992 (when Buyoya, a Tutsi and former military ruler, handed power to the first elected Hutu-led government).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Eck said South Africa's best course was the much-maligned &quot;quiet diplomacy. If you had a foreign force invading Burundi, it would terminate Burundi. There would be total resistance from the minority. The (Tutsi- dominated) army, if it felt threatened to the extent that it felt it will be defeated, would probably leave the country and return as new militias or a new rebel movement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Van Eck said Buyoya, whom he met a year ago in Burundi, and whom he introduced to leaders in South Africa late last year, had committed himself to restoring security, disciplining his army and starting all-inclusive talks leading to a new Constitution and elections.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The leader of a right-wing plot to destabilise KwaZulu-Natal, Gerrit Anderson, launched a hunger strike this week in protest against an eight-year prison sentence he began last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson (41) skipped bail in May after being convicted of illegal possession of 10 home-made pipe-guns in connection with an Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) plot to destabilise KwaZulu-Natal. He was rearrested in Bloemfontein in late July and was sentenced in the Escourt Regional Magistrate's Court last week to eight years' imprisonment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magistrate Berend Willemse found that Anderson was the leader of a group of right-wingers who plotted to destabilise the province shortly after the 1994 elections, in a bid to secure a white volkstaat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Anderson had received his orders -- which the court had heard included closing off KwaZulu- Natal's borders with the help of 200 000 Zulus trained by 200 French Foreign Legion soldiers, poisoning the water supply in African National Congress-supporting townships and seizing control of several army bases --from AWB general Dirk Ackerman. Anderson received the 10 pipe- guns from Free State AWB general Kiewiet Roodt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anderson's fellow plotters, Allan Nolte, Sharon Hattingh, Patrick Rousseau and Gerald Veltman received sentences in May ranging from two years' imprisonment to a six months' suspended sentence, for various charges of illegal weapons possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rousseau, a French national, was deported after receiving a suspended sentence for illegally possessing a 9mm pistol he admitted acquiring during the ill-fated 1994 AWB invasion of Boph-uthatswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the group also possessed plastic bottles filled with a cyanide- based powder when police arrested them in Ladysmith in June 1994, no convictions were secured on this count as possession of such a substance is technically not a crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passing sentence on Anderson last week, Willemse said he could not consider a probation sentence as the AWB leader had proved himself to be unreliable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had also attempted several times to delay the trial and had aggravated his crime by handing the weapons over to Returned Exiles Committee founder Pat Hlongwane, knowing that they could be used to kill people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hlongwane handed the weapons over to police and exposed the plot, but was not indemnified from prosecution as he was found to be an unreliable witness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After 18 months in the dock, former Vlakplaas hitsquad commander Eugene de Kock has conceded his involvement in some of the 121 charges against him. The charges include murder, attempted murder, fraud and illegal arms possession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Kock was involved in a large number of &quot;dirty tricks&quot; operations during the 1980s and early 1990s. His concessions this week have raised the spectre of him telling all when he testifies in mitigation -- and implicating top officers of the former Security Force and even former Cabinet ministers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prosecution closed its argument in the Pretoria Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking for conviction on a charge that De Kock was accessory to the murder of Sweet Sambo, who was brutally killed by security policemen near Komatipoort in 1991. Prosecutor Torie Pretorius said the body had been blown up several times on De Kock's orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The state dealt with the other charges earlier, arguing that it had proved the majority of counts beyond reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The turn in events came late on Wednesday, when De Kock's junior counsel, Danny du Preez, asked Judge Willem van der Merwe for a postponement to consult with his client over &quot;possible concessions&quot;. Judge van der Merwe remarked that the weight of evidence against De Kock may have brought about a measure of reality. On Thursday, his counsel conceded De Kock's guilt on the three murder charges against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Final argument by De Kock's senior counsel is expected to take a week or more, which means judgment may be delivered towards the end of the month. A guilty sentence on at least some of the charges is now a foregone conclusion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plea in mitigation will follow argument. De Kock has already shown he will co-operate with his accusers, the office of Transvaal Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira, on other investigations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little to hold him back from implicating top Security Force officers and members of the government when he testifies in his own mitigation. It is likely that his plea will centre on the &quot;political&quot; dimension of his crimes, and the argument that he was merely following orders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood preparations are being made for De Kock's trial to be followed by the &quot;trial of the generals&quot; D'Oliveira has been promising for almost a year. The Transvaal attorney general last year told Parliament's Justice Committee he was ready to prosecute the &quot;first real 'third force' trial&quot;, but was being held up by a lack of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former police general &quot;Krappies&quot; Engelbrecht may be among the first of De Kock's superiors who will be in the dock. De Kock's evidence may be a handy tool in the hands of the prosecution if and when this happens.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crime fighting in South Africa is being hampered by a 22 479-person staff shortage in the South African Police Service, according to a study carried out by the SAPS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research conducted by the police human resources division found that the ideal national headcount for the SAPS to function effectively should be 161 755.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is little chance of meeting that optimum figure: a government financial freeze in recruitment means that no new entrants will be enlisted into the SAPS this year. In some provinces there have not been any new recruits since 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is reaching a critical point. We desperately need new blood, but at the moment we make do as best as possible,&quot; said Johan Deyzel, provincial police commissioner for the Northern Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would like to see more &quot;bobbies on the beat&quot;, but resources are stretched enough. As it is, he relies on his officers to work overtime to meet the shortfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not good for morale and it is not the best way to use our limited resources, but there is no alternative when we are unable to recruit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area has 85 stations staffed by some 3 670 police officers. &quot;Ideally I need another 800 to deal with the large number of violent knife-related crimes in the area,&quot; said Deyzel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His was one of several provinces to insist that personnel shortfall was straining the SAPS's crime- fighting capabilities and hampering attempts to halt the country's crime scourge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KwaZulu-Natal communications officer Bala Naidoo described how visiting police officials from the UK usually expressed amazement that there is only one police officer per 445 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have about 20 000 and we need 26 000. It means our response times are not as quick as they should be, that patrols have to cover huge areas and that in some cases people are not getting the service they should,&quot; said Naidoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In North West province, the ratio is one officer to every 630 people.&quot;We are 70% understaffed,&quot; complained director of management Marius Dippenaar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He argues that there are fewer policemen now than before the 1994 elections.  Hardest hit are Joubert police station (39% understaffed) and Klerksdorp police station (45% understaffed).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gauteng, which shoulders the burden of most of the crimes committed nationwide, estimates that it has one officer per 249 civilians -- and that does not include illegal immigrants. According to representative Azwindini Nengovhela: &quot;We have not replaced any of the officers lost since the election through death or retirement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far this year alone nearly 700 officers have left the SAPS. Nengovhela says that only by relying on the army and private security firms to supplement personnel can the police maintain high visibility and carry out certain duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In normal circumstances we should be able to stand on our own, but for some operations we find ourselves increasingly relying on back-up from the army. That is not the way for a democratic police service to operate.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Investigation Task Unit (ITU) probing hit-squads in KwaZulu-Natal is to lose another key member: state prosecutor Carl Koenig will leave his post next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koenig will follow supercop Frank Dutton to take up a post with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His departure will be a blow to the ITU as well as the legal team prosecuting former defence minister Magnus Malan and 16 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koenig played a pivotal role in bringing the case to trial and assists attorney general Tim McNally and prosecutor Bennie Schonfeldt in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was expected to be called on to lead evidence, as his role in the investigation had equipped him with intimate knowledge of the case. But relations between him and McNally soured last year after McNally suspended him on the day the trial's first suspects were to appear in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koenig was already seconded to the ITU, which answers to Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, at the time, and McNally argued that &quot; recent events have brought into sharper focus for me the fact that (Koenig is) no longer accountable (to him)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McNally said Koenig had been attached to the Goldstone Commission before his secondment to the ITU and had not been prosecuting for some time. He lifted Koenig's suspension after a confrontation with the ITU, agreeing that Koenig could report to him and Mufamadi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Wednesday's disaster at Tembisa station on the East Rand, which left 15 dead and at least 50 in hospital, was a bloody reminder of a deep crisis in South Africa's public transport system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some stations are like cattle stations,&quot; said a source in the Transport Ministry, which is heading an inquiry into the disaster. &quot;This shows the need for a reliable and decent public transport system - -- something South Africa has lacked for years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But the government can't continue to pump money into commuters. We need to get the system to a standard where people are prepared to pay for it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Metrorail representative Bintu Petsana said the company lost R118-million in unpaid commuter tickets last year and has been trying to find means to get commuters to pay for the service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said: &quot;There is a resistance from some people to pay for tickets. There are those who pay and others refuse. I think that's what caused the incident.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petsana said 33% of rail commuters in the Wits region evaded paying their fares. In Cape Town, the figure is as high as 40%, with a 33% evasion rate in Port Elizabeth and East London, and 25% in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The inquiry will consider whether the security firm, or the Rail Commuter Corporation, gave adequate warning of the ticket clampdown. It will also look at the issue of using electric batons as a deterrent, and the quality of the batons that were used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembisa station is used by 17 000 people daily, and this week Metrorail embarked on a large scale ticket inspection. Metrorail has defended both the use of electric batons and its &quot;surprise security raids&quot; as a way of combating the problem of fare evasion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petsana said Metrorail started abolishing the carrying of guns by its security after complaints from commuters two years ago, and the batons used in the disaster this week were non-lethal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ian Olivier, managing director of security firm SSH, employed by Metrorail to police the station, was not prepared to comment, but said that security specifications are laid down by Metro. &quot;We just carry out what they specify us to do,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petsana said surprise raids were made on a &quot;regular&quot; basis and said commuters were aware of this, but did not know when raids took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday and Tuesday, there was the same number of security officers on duty at the station as Wednesday. The transport ministry inquiry will consider the possibility that Wednesday's tragedy was the result of a concerted protest against the security measures which have been beefed up recently, and the fares charged for a poor quality of service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Honey Mateya, Metrorail's acting executive communications manager, says Metrorail had monitored SSH's operations to ensure security methods were according to their specifications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Metrorail is happy with the work of SSH and has renewed their contract.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mateya was not prepared to blame anyone in particular for the disaster, and felt the commission of inquiry should be allowed to deal with the matter.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The State Archives has allowed the Mail &amp; Guardian access to cabinet memoranda, which were for years kept locked away in terms of the Archives Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a search through the papers revealed nothing that would have caused the collapse of the South African state -- though some very telling documents do stand out among a largely mundane collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The papers shown to the M&amp;G are all memoranda submitted to Cabinet by government departments to motivate requests that Cabinet act on a particular matter. Many of them deal with such matters as a proposed salary increase for secretaries or a summary of the five-year programme of the National Committee on Hydrology.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But several of the papers are confirmation of the obsessive and self- contradictory attempts to enforce grand apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Take, for example, the one from the ministry of planning and statistics called Coloureds in the Republic of South Africa -- regional settlement areas and labour sphere of influence. It states bluntly that &quot;coloureds must be removed from the area to the east of the Fish-Cat line, except in East London, Breidbach and Queenstown. The coloured group areas in Aliwal North, Dordrecht, Lady Grey, Elliot and Maclear must not be de-proclaimed, but coloureds must be slowly moved out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drafters of the paper acknowleged there may be snags with this plan, for example the building trade and other industries objecting to &quot;bantu&quot; labourers replacing coloureds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A memo submitted by the department of bantu administration deals with the establishment of a &quot;bantu film industry&quot;. It motivates the need for such an industry on the grounds that &quot;there are no bantu films, and white films are often unacceptable, undesirable and not suitable for bantu audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The low moral standards of many overseas films, laced with situations of immorality and subtle racial equality, contribute to the undermining and eventual destruction of cultural values.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper outlines a plan for the Bantu Film Trust, which was to have three white directors and a budget of R4,5-million to make 30 films a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department of information presented Cabinet with a memo on the improving of South Africa's image abroad, emphasising the importance of improving the government's relationship with foreign correspondents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Permanent correspondents have no facilities and are left in the clutches of people with hostile intentions, who are only too happy to help. Some of them even have their offices at the Cape Times, the Star or the Rand Daily Mail.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Archives Act puts an automatic 30-year embargo on all the government documents, but the M&amp;G was granted permission to see the cabinet memoranda and other documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A request by M&amp;G to see the minutes of cabinet meetings prompted the Department of Arts and Culture to request a search for cabinet notebooks from before 1978, which had gone missing. These notebooks are the only records of cabinet meetings from that era, since formal minute-keeping only began on the orders of state president PW Botha in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Arts and Culture representative Frans Basson has told the M&amp;G these notebooks, covering the period 1956 to 1978, have subsequently come to light among &quot;miscellaneous boxed material&quot; in the archives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G is still awaiting ministerial permission to see these and other cabinet records.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Telkom has taken to barring certain phone lines to international calls, in an attempt to &quot;protect&quot; its clients from fraudsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Johannesburg Telkom official admitted this to the Mail &amp; Guardian after the newspaper was approached by a telephone user who found certain international numbers were blocked to her after hours -- even though Telkom's head office denies knowledge of the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The M&amp;G was alerted to the problem by Michelle Aarons, a book editor who lives in Parktown and whose job often involves phoning outside the country after hours. An attempt to reach London resulted in a recorded message telling her the line was blocked and she must place her call through the operator. The operator told her this would involve a R5 surcharge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aarons says when she phoned Telkom in Johannesburg, officials had told her of people who were tapping into Telkom lines so they could make calls on other people's accounts. These people were then charging customers -- mostly foreign visitors and illegal immigrants -- one rand a minute to make international calls, a substantial saving on the rate charged by Telkom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was told the racket was linked to certain taxi services which ferried callers in from suburban hotels to make their cut-price calls on the illegal lines. In order to stop the scam, Telkom was blocking calls from numbers starting with 643 -- an exchange that covers Hillbrow and part of Parktown -- to central London and certain central African countries. According to the official, many of the illegal callers were immigrants with contacts elsewhere in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Telkom's customer care manager Theo Theron told the M&amp;G he did not know anything about Telkom barring calls in this way. He said a customer who had a problem with an international call could place it through the operator -- a call placed manually did not incur a surcharge, but there was a minimum charge equivalent to a three-minute call, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one of the officials whom Aarons had contacted confirmed certain lines had been prevented from making calls to certain foreign destinations, for customers' own good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why do they come and complain to us when we're doing it as a service to them?&quot; he grumbled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said tapping into a phone line was easy: &quot;it only takes a piece of copper wire&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Itemised telephone accounts are only available to users connected to new electronic exchanges, and many numbers in Hillbrow and Parktown are still on old-style systems.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A surprise raid on Johannesburg's Brixton Police Station has thrown up a towel and a plastic bag that match the descriptions given by a 17- year-old girl, who claims a policeman tortured her with the articles three weeks ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The girl, who has asked not to be named, was a witness to a shooting three weeks ago -- not a suspect. She has laid assault charges against a white policeman she claims repeatedly suffocated her with the towel and plastic bag.  She also alleges a black policeman ordered her to undress so he could beat her for more information.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the incident, attorney Peter Jordi of the Wits University Law Clinic obtained a court order to search the police station. The towel will go to the police forensic laboratory before the case continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the girl's affidavit -- which persuaded the Rand Supreme Court to grant the order -- the night before she was grilled, she was walking home through Mayfair West, a built-up suburb west of Johannesburg, when a minibus drew up next to her and a former boyfriend, Dumisani, beckoned her to join him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she refused, the minibus's occupants got out and ordered her in. Some passersby rescued her and she walked home. &quot;I thought that one of the passersby may have been a man known to me as Thabo. I do not know him very well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As she approached the house where her mother was employed as a domestic worker, she noticed the minibus had pulled into the driveway and Thabo and another man were following her. She called her mother who asked Dumisani to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dumisani only did so when the owners of the house came out. He reversed the minibus into the street and drove towards her mother, who leapt out of the way. As Dumisani drove off, Thabo and his companion fired two shots at the minibus, hitting Dumisani, who died that night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A few hours later a white policeman instructed her and her mother to come to the Brixton Police Station. &quot;We waited at the police station, but nothing happened. The policeman then brought us back to our house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day, a black policeman from the Brixton Police Station arrived at her work and drove her to her mother. During the trip, he asked whether she knew Dumisani. &quot;I said that I did not. He told me that if I did not tell the truth he would beat me until I told the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the police station her mother explained that Dumisani was the girl's ex- boyfriend. The policeman insisted she knew the two men who had shot at the minibus and accused her of lying when she said she did not. &quot;My mother's response to the persistent questioning was that if the police were so sure that she knew who the two were, then they should put her in the cells.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her mother returned home and the girl was questioned further. During the interrogation a white policeman entered the office several times and said if she was lying, his colleague would pass her to him and he would &quot;make sure that I spoke the truth&quot;. Her interrogator eventually did just that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I went into the white policeman's office and he told me to sit on the chair. I was alone in the office with him. The white policeman closed the door and took a towel which he rolled up into a sausage. He told me to sit up in the chair and ordered me to tell him who the two were who had been involved in the shooting. I told him that I knew the name of one to be Thabo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When she claimed not to know Thabo's address, the policeman said she was lying. &quot;The white policeman then held the towel tightly around my face so that my mouth and nose were covered. I was unable to breathe. I think that he only released the towel after two or three minutes. The towel was blue in colour and was quite large.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The white policeman then left his office leaving me inside. He returned with the towel which was now wet. He again placed it tightly around my face, but this time he first placed a plastic bag between the towel and my face.  The plastic bag was light in colour, being blue or grey. The process was repeated a third time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following day she returned to the police station, where another black policeman with a Zionist Christian Church badge insisted she disclose where Thabo lived. &quot;He said that as I continued to lie I should get undressed because he wanted to hit me. I then started to undress and when I got down to my T-shirt he told me that I should put my clothes back on. He told me to go and find Thabo.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A relative helped her to find Thabo's address. After talking to a cobbler near the local supermarket they worked out he was in fact Lucky Maphalala who lived in Zola 1, Soweto. She returned to the police station and related what she had found out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Acting Brixton Police Station head Captain van der Westhuizen declined to comment on the matter as it was sub judice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission received unexpected salary increases of 25% during July, only a few months after they started work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increase brought each commissioner's pre-tax earnings to R28 750 per month -- about R15 000 after tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But not all the commissioners are happy about the increases, and are planning to donate the extra money to other causes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increases came as a surprise to the commissioners and were only announced in the middle of July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commissioners have not yet discussed a united response to the salary increase. But there appears to be a difference in attitude between those commissioners who come from a non-governmental organisation background and are used to a more modest salary, and those who worked as professionals before being appointed to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission member Mary Burton, a trustee and former president of the Black Sash, said she had written to Minister of Justice Dullah Omar saying she did not want the increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I don't need it, and I don't think it's right to be paid such large salaries as there are such gaps in our society.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burton said she had requested the money be paid directly into the President's Reparations Fund, which is intended to provide funds to implement the recommendations of the truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If an investment is being made in the commission, it is logical that the money should be used in the same area,&quot; Burton said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice ministry representative Paul Setsetse said the commissioners had been granted the increases to keep their salaries in line with those of judges. The ministry was not aware of any requests for the money to be redirected, he said, but pointed out the commissioners were free to donate their salaries elsewhere as they chose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But commissioners have pointed out it would be preferable for the money to be redirected before being paid as salaries and taxed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth commissioner Richard Lyster said the increases were &quot;inappropriate&quot;, and he would request the ministry to reverse its decision on the salaries. If this could not be done, he would put the extra money into a charitable trust or the reparations fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Allen, representative for TRC chair Desmond Tutu, said Tutu has, up to now, given half of his salary to bursaries for the children of Anglican clergy, and for students at the University of the Western Cape of which he is chancellor. He will continue to give half of his post-tax earnings to these causes. Tutu's new salary will be around R30 000 before tax, or around R17 000 after tax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - John Aspinall, right-wing zookeeper, multimillionaire gambler and friend of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is eyeing KwaZulu-Natal as the site for his next casino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was confirmed by Lazelle Krog, the province's director of policy and legislative development in gaming and betting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aspinall's casino empire is based in London, with operations in France and New Zealand. Aspinall's office had no comment on the matter of the KwaZulu- Natal casino bid. Aspinall has not yet announced his plans, which are still subject to approval by the provincial gambling board which will only be established towards the end of the year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Aspinall's KwaZulu-Natal casino bid is successful, it will combine two of the man's abiding passions: gambling and Zulus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an interview in the London Financial Times earlier this year, Aspinall's obsession with Zulu culture dates back to his childhood when he read the adventure novels of Rider Haggard, 50 years before he first visited Zululand. He remains firm in his belief that the Zulu nation is a noble one and the custodian of a threatened culture -- in interviews in recent years he has portrayed the ANC as the greatest menace to the survival of the Zulus.  This view has underpinned his financial support for the Inkatha Freedom Party, and he maintains a friendship with Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the middle of the KwaZulu-Natal municipal election campaign in June this year, Buthelezi took time out to attend Aspinall's lavish 70th birthday party in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The casino plan is not Aspinall's first attempt to expand his business operations into his favourite South African province. Last year he was part of an unsuccessful bid to develop the Point area of Durban into a recreation area similar to the Cape Town Waterfront, a bid in which his close friends and fellow tycoons James Goldsmith and Kerry Packer were also involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A gambler since his student days at Oxford, Aspinall professes a philosophy of life which celebrates the irrationality of the gaming table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reason is the worst possible guide to human affairs,&quot; he was once quoted as saying. &quot;It is merely the undertaker that you send in after the battle to explain the logic of the affair. Instinct and prejudice are much better guides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He combines support for right-wing causes with a dedication to the preservation of wildlife, and owns a successful zoo in Kent in south-east England.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aspinall is believed by some IFP leaders to have hired Ian Greer and Associates election consultants who ran the IFP's local government campaign in KwaZulu-Natal. Greer's company was reportedly paid more than R2-million for the campaign. When Greer and associates arrived in the province they were working with Brendan Bruce, who was former director of communications for former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Isaac Rani was tortured for three days by security police after they arrested him in the Sixties for leaving South Africa for military training. On the third day, he was visited by a district surgeon while he lay in his cell vomiting blood. Rani told a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) hearing the doctor said there was nothing that could be done to help him, he would be dead soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission investigators, after listening to evidence like this at countless hearings on gross human rights violations, are hard at work uncovering proof of the torture and the names of the police involved. But they will not necessarily attempt to discover why the unnamed doctor did not insist Rani be taken to hospital for treatment, or that his torture be stopped immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are doctors who are concerned by the mounting evidence that their colleagues were involved in human rights abuses either by omission or commission. They are clamouring for a medical TRC to uncover the past and prevent such violations in the future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the abuse is already well documented and infamous around the world.  The conduct of the two district surgeons who attended to dying activist Steve Biko, led to the Medical Association of South Africa's (Masa) resignation from the World Medical Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Biko affair focused the international spotlight on South Africa's doctors and their ethical stance in an apartheid system. It highlighted the failures of the Medical Association of South Africa and the South African Medical and Dental Council (SAMDC) to censure -- or protect -- doctors when their ethics were questioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Biko doctors, Dr Benjamin Tucker, was a Masa member. When the association refused to cancel his membership or disassociate itself from the SAMDC's findings, several prominent members resigned and formed the National Medical and Dental Association (Namda).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One Masa member did attempt to highlight the dilemmas which the medical profession faced in South Africa. The late Dr Jonathan Gluckman, a Masa office-bearer who worked closely with families of detainees, spoke out about the problems of segregated health care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gluckman went up against former minister of law and order Hernus Kriel, whom he accused of conducting a fraudulent investigation into the treatment of detainees. Kriel responded by accusing Gluckman of &quot;self-glorification&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the previous minister of health, Dr Rina Venter, exonerated Gluckman. In an attempt to desegregate hospitals, Venter discovered there were no laws on the statute books which forced them to care for white patients separately from blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It appeared that the medical profession itself had instituted these rules -- not only in state hospitals, but in countless private practitioners' surgeries which had separate waiting rooms for white and black patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, Masa finally apologised for its silence on race-based policies affecting the medical profession. Without listing the issues for which it was apologising, the association admitted &quot;persons within and outside the medical profession might, in the past, have been hurt or offended by acts of omission or commission on Masa's part&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most successful challenge to the medical profession came in 1985 from a young Port Elizabeth district surgeon Dr Wendy Orr. She brought a supreme court interdict against the prison authorities to stop them from assaulting her patients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case won her instant infamy in government circles and she was effectively stopped from performing her clinical duties. Today, Orr is a commissioner on the TRC and attends its hearings where victims of police brutality often highlight the failure of doctors to protect them from assaults from the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Victim after victim has told the TRC how district surgeons treated them in the presence of the security forces, how some gave the go-ahead for further interrogations despite their patients showing obvious signs of mistreatment and how inquest documentation did not match the wounds relatives had seen in state mortuaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Cape Town this week, the medical profession debated the call for a medical TRC. At a panel discussion organised by the Trauma Centre for Victims of Violence and Torture, speakers spoke of the need to uncover and document the sins of the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Leslie London of the Department of Community Health at the University of Cape Town (UCT), said the case for a medical truth commission was compelling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Masa's apology is not underpinned by concrete documentation of what it needed to apologise for. It does not tell us when abuse stopped. An apology does not identify what the failings were in the past and how we are going to prevent it in the future. It is almost like a self-declared amnesty,&quot; said London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the medical TRC should be public and send a strong message that the transgression of human rights would not occur again in the South African medical profession. The commission could make recommendations at its conclusion to upgrade ethical education in health sciences and improve reporting mechanisms in places of detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masa's manager of medical ethics Gavin Damster said he believed it was unnecessary to duplicate the functions of the multimillion rand TRC, which it supported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have asked all of our members to go to the TRC if they have been involved in gross human rights violations. This has been an issue of concern to Masa even before the TRC was up and running,&quot; Damster said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are prepared to criticise our members who are not performing and this practice has always been there. Doctors involved have been sent by Masa to the Medical and Dental Council.&quot; Damster admitted that many doctors working with the police and prisons believed they had a dual responsibility to the state and their patients. He suggested this dilemma be investigated in a similar manner to the British Medical and Dental Association, which published a report on state doctors called Medicine Betrayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mary Rayner of Amnesty International, said the problems highlighted in Medicine Betrayed supported the call for a medical TRC. The investigation had shown how ordinary men and women became unwittingly involved in systematic human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our experience around the world has shown that there are all sorts of reasons why medical practitioners working in a prison or army barracks can fail in their duty to their patients,&quot; Rayner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They can accept the security force's ideology and motives, they can be affected by the social milieu in which they mix in daily life, they could be concerned about their careers or be subject to direct threats. Over time they can be drawn into a situation of complicity in which the detainee suffers grossly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'It is outside the scope of the TRC to tease out the subtle, institutional ways in which the security forces found support outside their own ranks for what they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In South Africa there are examples of this. There are doctors who participated directly by falsifying medical records. There must be more cases than Steve Biko -- people who did not have publicity and expensive advocates at their inquests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rayner said the situation was not only of academic interest as abuse was still occurring in South Africa. The &quot;unreformed&quot; police force was still torturing people by electric shock and suffocation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People entering the medical profession needed information about where the traps lay. They needed to learn the small and passive ways doctors could participate in human rights abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;District surgeons embarking on their careers won't know how to conduct themselves if they don't know what happened in the past,&quot; Rayner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Interim South African Medical and Dental Council's registrar, Nic Prinsloo, said his organisation did not discuss the call for a medical TRC and he could thus not comment on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that the organisation replaced the SAMDC and could not be accountable for what it had done in the past. Although Prinsloo had served on the SAMDC, he was not prepared to discuss how to address its failings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Judith van Heerden, of UCT's Department of Primary Health Care, sent a direct challenge to Masa and the SAMDC to organise a parallel medical truth commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in the June issue of the South African Medical Journal, Van Heerden said South Africa's past was littered with incidents where doctors neglected their caring duty. &quot;Collusion with the state was regarded as patriotic duty by some of them,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The pain and remorse of this process will be living proof as a commitment to ensure that what happened to Steve Biko should never be allowed to happen in any country that regards itself as civilised,&quot; she quoted from a South African Medical Journal editorial of 1991.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A platform for South African businesses to establish new contacts in the United States and Canada has been established by Rainbow Business Network International (RBNI), a Gauteng-based company which will present trade and tourism networking sessions and mini-expos lasting two days in major commercial centres in the US and Canada in October and November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The principle of 'business contact networking' was earmarked as a prime objective by the United Nations and World Trade Organisation at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) IX in Midrand. RBNI's venture is a much needed instrument in South Africa and is in close synergy with the UN's objective for developing countries internationally,&quot; the company's managing director, Clarice Senekal, said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa's expanding role in the global trade, economic and business wo period of community service to the seven years' training required for qualification as a doctor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the controversy has raised questions as to why the concept should be limited to doctors and to teachers -- who have long repaid their training loans by state service. What of other professions like law and engineering?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the state ploughs billions into tertiary education only a fraction is paid back in student fees -- and only by some students. Given the crisis around university financing, many are asking whether the time has come for a more effective tertiary financing system that allows students to pay back the money it costs to educate them by doing community service in the public sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wits University dean of health sciences Professor Max Price suggests a student-loan system whereby students pay back the bulk of their loans by service -- as in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government should give them a loan to pay the entire cost and should then write this off in return for community service. This is not a dictatorial phenomenon. It's done in most industrial countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such a scheme should apply to all professions, not just teachers and doctors. &quot;It would make it clear that taxpayers are making a major investment in individuals' education. The state and society is entitled to a return on that investment,&quot; says Price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Community service has been proposed by the National Commission on Higher Education (NCHE) as one way of paying back the state's contribution towards their studies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the concept has not been developed in any real way and the NCHE, whose final report is due this month, has not thus far come up with solutions to the funding crisis in the tertiary sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">John Gear, director of the Wits Rural Facility, backs the idea of incentive- driven rather than compulsory community service. &quot;If it is compulsion- driven as opposed to incentive-driven the consequences are resistance, resentment and inferior services,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in some fields, the idea of community service still meets with resistance. Wits University engineering professor Hu Hanrahan said he doubted whether sufficient job opportunities for engineering community service existed in the state. &quot;I don't think community service is as practical in engineering as it is in the health service. It will siphon the engineers out of the market and that will impact on the GDP,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the notion is popular in some law faculties which point to the need for legal services in rural areas, practical steps at introducing community service have yet to be taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the idea of voluntary service is now taking root on campuses, says Professor Christof Heyns, acting director of Pretoria University's Centre for Human Rights. Heyns helped found the Southern African Student Volunteers three years ago, an organisation based on 22 university and technikon campuses which sends students during holidays to needy areas to help upgrade schools and clinics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We get seven times more applications than we can access. It's definitely becoming more popular.&quot; But Heyns says black students are far keener on the programmes than their white counterparts who make up only 10% of the volunteer force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African Students' Congress backs the idea of community service, which &quot;augurs well with the spirit of nation-building enshrined in the RDP&quot;, says deputy secretary general Kenny Diseko. &quot;We are in support of such a policy because it balances the notion of the brain drain. Some people are selfish. Students should feel obliged to do community service as a contribution to the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC Youth League general secretary Febe Potgieter says her organisation supports the idea of youth service programmes in tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a need to see that everyone with state assistance must give something back.&quot; The National Youth Commission returned recently from a trip to the United States armed with new ideas on implementing community service.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Reserve Bank has hit back at accusations of racism, brought by Cosatu at last week's bank collusion hearings and based on a confidential report by CS First Boston.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says deputy governor, Dr Timothy Thahane: &quot;I took up my appointment in April, some time after Mary Davis of CS First Boston visited this country and wrote her report, so I was not privy to any discussions she may have held with bank representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Her opinion that the bank is opposed to affirmative action is wrong; policies have been in place for some time, although implementation has lagged behind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The governor, Dr Chris Stals, has written to the president of the New York investment bank, condemning the report in the strongest terms: &quot;I cannot but strongly object to this kind of blatant misinformation being distributed to potential investors in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was not in the country at the time of the visit of Ms Davis, but all my efforts to locate anybody in the Reserve Bank who may have granted her an interview failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Attempts to contact Davis proved fruitless but her original report said: &quot; They (the bank) are critical of affirmative action employment policies, even though blacks are utterly under-represented at the bank, on the grounds that not enough skilled blacks are available, although they have not implemented a training programme.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thahane was quick to refute this criticism: &quot;There are three top black executives, plus myself, and others at a more junior level. We have a training programme -- eight cadets have graduated from the two-year course, which entailed a period in each department. Of these, one has gone on to complete a doctorate, another has left. But the others are staying in permanent positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I joined the bank, my aim was to push ahead with affirmative action policies and that's exactly what I'm doing. In terms of the bank's written policy, there was little I could add, but implementation has not been as rapid as hoped. We are moving to change all that, and by this stage next year we will be in a position to report concrete progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment of Thahane was seen as a step in the right direction by disgruntled bank staff, but the process has been too slow to counter all complaints, says an insider.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Thahane: &quot;Any change in an institution like ours is not easy and anxieties are understandable. But we have to make sure that we employ the best people to the best of their abilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Basically, it is now a question of training, otherwise we run into problems of performance. But Dr Stals has assured me that there are no constraints on a budget for training and we are planning to link up with various other central banks, such as the Bank of England, to enhance our training programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Top management has to give the affirmative action plan special attention.  We now have a succession plan in place for all levels of management, and managers are responsible for ensuring that previously unrepresented groups are carefully considered. Any managers that don't actively participate in meeting these objectives will be moved out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stals was also quick to dispel the doubts cast by Davis on the bank's loyalty to the government and the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP): &quot;It is also just not true to say that 'The bank is critical of the RDP and its goals'. Anybody who may have read through the many references I made to the RDP in public speeches ... will know that the bank has never criticised the RDP and its objectives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But once the story of the confidential report had broken, Davis backtracked from her initial tough stance towards the bank. She was quoted as saying: &quot;I believe the Reserve Bank has been acting in the best interests of the economy at all times ... It is absolutely and utterly crucial that the bank have the freedom to operate independently.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela tried to persuade axed deputy minister of environmental affairs and tourism Bantu Holomisa to apologise for remarks he made about Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau before the truth commission, saying this would enable him to neutralise the forces against the former Transkei military ruler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa told the Mail &amp; Guardian the president's appeal came soon after African National Congress secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa publicly announced he would face a disciplinary hearing for saying Sigcau received a R50 000 cut of a R2-million bribe allegedly paid by hotel magnate Sol Kerzner to then Transkei president George Matanzima to secure gambling rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;President Mandela called me from Transkei but couldn't get me. His last call to my wife was at 3am. He called my drivers, he left a message on my cellphone which was in my hotel. I got his messages in the morning and phoned him at about 10am.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He advised me to apologise for what I said about (Sigcau) at the truth commission so that the whole thing could be handled. He said this issue would divide the organisation and my opponents would find an opportunity to go at me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He said if I said I was asked by him to apologise he would be able to neutralise the forces against me -- that was how he put it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa, whom Mandela sacked as deputy minister last Friday, said he told the president that by apologising he would be &quot;putting my credibility on the line&quot;: he had toppled the Transkei government in the 1987 coup because of the corruption riddling it. &quot;The entire military council which took that decision in 1987 as well as the Transkei Defence Force would find it difficult to do that.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I found it ethically impossible (to apologise). I differed with him (Mandela) fundamentally. God will forgive me if I had taken the wrong judgment on not taking his advice. He is always accused of protecting Holomisa. He knows the people who are against me,&quot; Holomisa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa on Thursday suggested the government had been compromised by Kerzner. It was &quot;common cause that as a result of the R2-million bribe&quot; Kerzner faced criminal prosecution, and &quot;I have been most insistent that Sol Kerzner be charged&quot;, Holomisa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While he could understand why the National Party government deliberately frustrated such prosecution from taking place, he could not understand why &quot; the democratic government has been compromised&quot;. He said he had &quot;privileged information&quot; relating to Kerzner's financial aid to the ANC to contest the 1994 elections and said it was known he had funded social events of leading ANC members, including Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's 50th birthday party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, &quot;as a loyal member of the ANC&quot; he wanted to &quot;resist the inference that the price that our organisation had to pay in return&quot; was that Kerzner would not be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a handwritten post-script to the letter to Ramaphosa setting out his objections, Holomisa wrote: &quot;The bottom line: get yourselves out of Sol Kerzner's top drawer first, thereafter you can point fingers. Many in this country would agree with me that there is a symbiotic relationship between Kerzner's R2-million payment to the former Transkei officials and the subsequent favours offered by Mr Kerzner and his company to some of us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa was making public his objections to the hearing, set down for Cape Town on August 14. He contends the ANC has no jurisdiction to charge him for testifying as a &quot;concerned citizen and former head of the then government of Transkei&quot; and mentioning Sigcau &quot;in passing&quot; as a member of the former homeland administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue was &quot;not so much about Minister Stella Sigcau&quot; as it was &quot;about Sol Kerzner&quot;, Holomisa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A further objection is that he believes the disciplinary hearing will be biased against him on the basis of Mbeki's earlier remarks that Holomisa's testimony was &quot;ill-informed and malicious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This leads me to the irresistible conclusion that even without hearing my side of the story, he had come to the conclusion that I was the guilty party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;His influence in the organisation cannot be underestimated and therefore it is conceivable that whoever presides might be constrained to return a verdict that would be more in line with the expectations of the deputy president than the merits of any case I might be able to put before the disciplinary committee, however persuasive ordinarily those merits might be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was now clear he was being charged for having testified before the truth commission. While the ANC had denied members first had to have their testimony vetted, &quot;as long as Deputy President Mbeki's state views ...  prevail the work and credibility of the TRC will be seriously undermined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Already the TRC as well as the public are finding it extremely difficult to separate my dismissal from government from my having testified in the TRC..  . pressing charges... will only serve to confirm that public perception.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa has asked Ramaphosa to respond to a letter setting out his objections in writing before August 14. He could be expelled from the party, in which case he loses his seat as an MP, or suspended, or sentenced to some form of community service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had been informed that he would be asked to apologise and that if he declined to he could be suspended or expelled.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington DC - The following is a release from the U.S. Committee for Refugees entitled &quot;Coup in Burundi: Initial Recommendations and Analysis&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's tragic record of political and ethnic upheavals has demonstrated time and again during the past 30 years that sudden eruptions of violence and military oppression there can rapidly produce tens of thousands of deaths and a half-million or more new refugees within a period of days. Even before last week's coup d'etat, at least 800,000 Burundians were already refugees or internally displaced, including some 200,000 persons who have fled their homes in the past four months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. Committee for Refugees, which has issued two reports and more than 15 written updates on Burundi during the past three years, urges U.S.  officials to consider seven points in order to better understand and address Burundi's current emergency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Last week's events are the completion of a slow-motion coup initiated by the Burundian military and ethnic Tutsi extremists more than two years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official U.S. statements have conveyed a false impression that last week's coup was a sudden attack on Burundi's democracy. In fact, U.S. and other international officials largely watched as Burundi's attempts at democracy all but died long ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A slow-motion coup has been underway in Burundi since October 1993, when Tutsi soldiers assassinated the democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu. Subsequent negotiations held under the muzzles of military guns virtually nullified the constitution, stripped away presidential powers, eviscerated the elected National Assembly, awarded top government positions to extremist political parties with minimal popular support, and handed ultimate political power to an unelected, unrepresentative Security Council.  Thousands of Hutu civilians were ethnically cleansed from the capital. Last week's ouster of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya merely completes the creeping coup begun by extremists more than two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given these facts, official U.S. statements about recent events in Burundi have at times been strangely nonsensical. U.S. officials last week urged the coup makers to adhere to constitutional government, ignoring the fact that the same coup makers effectively nullified the constitution two years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department urged continuation of the elected National Assembly, ignoring that the National Assembly's power was largely nullified by the countrys creeping coup in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State Department stated that Burundians should maintain democratic institutions, despite the fact that Burundi's fragile democratic institutions have been steadily dismantled since 1993 by the same forces behind last weeks coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The United States should coordinate its Burundi policy with the Organization of African Unity (OAU), which continues to regard Ntibantunganya as president and has called Buyoya's presidency totally illegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">U.S. policy statements refuse to recognize Buyoya as president but appear to stop short of recognizing Ntibantunganya as president.  Statements by OAU leaders continue to recognize Ntibantunganya as president and insist that the new regime in Burundi is totally illegal and must be isolated. The U.S.  should work closely with the OAU to maintain coordinated policies and a united front in response to the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The United States should not assume that Burundi's apparent new leader, Pierre Buyoya, is the moderate he claims to be. Nor should the U.S. assume that Buyoya has any freedom of movement for moderate policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News reports last week quoted American officials praising Buyoya as a force for stability and moderation. These are shocking comments hours after Buyoya seized power in a coup against the country's legitimate president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya's alleged moderation is undependable. Buyoya could have demonstrated his moderation and his commitment to democratic principles by refusing to participate in the coup and insisting on the legitimacy of Ntibantunganya's presidency. He failed to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday, Buyoya exhorted Burundian Tutsi youths to arm themselves to participate in the defense of our country. Historically in Burundi and Rwanda, public calls to give weapons to undisciplined youths are a thinly veiled incitement to ethnic warfare, and typically lead to horrific ethnic massacres in the name of defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month while in Washington, Buyoya blamed Hutu rebels and the civilian government for fomenting violence, but largely refrained from blaming Burundi's military despite its record as the greatest source of atrocities.  Buyoya has refused to support a negotiated settlement to the country's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The United States should demand that Buyoya prove his moderation and his accountability by taking several steps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. should require Buyoya to prove his moderation in action rather than words.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should publicly urge Ntibantunganya to resume his duties as president.  Buyoya could become prime minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should offer to negotiate with rebel leaders without preconditions.  Although a ceasefire in the civil war is desirable, the lack of a ceasefire should not be used as an excuse to delay talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should arrest or politically neutralize leading Tutsi extremists, such as former president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should bring soldiers to justice for atrocities committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should support and continue the work of a special Burundian commission, begun earlier this month, to lay the groundwork for international military intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should move quickly to integrate and reform the justice system, which remains almost exclusively Tutsi dominated and lacks the political neutrality needed to dispense impartial justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt; Buyoya should adhere to his pledge made last weekend to end permanently the forcible expulsion of Rwandan Hutu refugees from Burundi. The Burundian military expelled nearly 15,000 refugees a week ago, in violation of international law. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees should receive unimpeded access to operate in the camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The United States should take the lead in providing human rights observers to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN authorized the deployment of some 30 human rights observers in Burundi months ago, but only four monitors have been deployed. The United States should take the lead in funding the full contingent of human rights observers and pushing to expand the size of the human rights monitoring program to at least 100 observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The UN investigation into Burundi's 1993 violence should be released immediately, with all details made public, in order to counter the culture of impunity that precipitates massacres and coups in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN investigators have purposely delayed publishing the results of their investigation into Burundi's 1993 violence and presidential assassination for fear the report would aggravate tensions in current-day Burundi. Burundi's 1993 violence left 50,000 or more persons dead. U.S. officials have shared the UN's reluctance to publish the full report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In view of last week's developments, it is again clear that impunity for past crimes begets more violence. UN human rights workers should publish their report, and should explicitly cite the names of government officials, politicians, and military personnel culpable in the 1993 bloodshed. The international community should no longer allow itself to be intimidated into silence about gross human rights abuses committed by Burundi's coup makers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Do not assume that relative calm in Bujumbura represents conditions or political sentiments throughout Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura, the capital, is heavily policed, and many areas were ethnically cleansed long before last week's coup. Buyoya and other coup participants have a vested interest in showcasing a calm Bujumbura to the international community in order to convey an image that the coup is benign, popular, and led by individuals skilled at governance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria (PANA) - With 90 minutes between them and Africa's first Olympic soccer gold medal, Nigeria's under-23 squad can afford to go for broke in Saturday's final against Argentina, going by the huge capital of goodwill that has greeted their 4-3 elimination of Brazil in one of the semi- finals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The superb performance put up by the Kanu Nwankwo-led Nigerians against &quot; mighty' Brazil, make Saturday's encounter against Argentina, another tested south American team, look ordinary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, however, does not undermine the resilience of Argentina, whose senior team beat Nigeria 2-1 in the 1994 World Cup finals hosted by the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Brazil's defeat by Nigeria has remained the talk of the town with the west Africans already looking as good as champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They appear well motivated to clinch Africa's first Olympic soccer gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the unprecedented five million naira (about 60,000 U.S. dollars) which the Nigerian government proposed to give them if they win the gold, the players have been enjoying enhanced match bonuses -- 5,000 dollars each for eliminating Mexico in the quarter-final and 7,000 dollars each for shooting down Brazil, which has never won an Olympic soccer gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rich Nigerians want to outdo each other in a donations galore to help the team bring the soccer gold to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Businessman and sports enthusiast, Aliko Dangote, of Dangote Group of Companies, has donated one million naira or 12,000 dollars to the squad and promised another five million naira, (60,000 dollars) if they win the gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigerian premier league club owner, Jude Ezechukwu has given 500,000 naira (6,000 dollars), with another pledge of undisclosed amount if the team triumphs over Argentina Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More donations are likely to follow, going by the enthusiasm aroused by the players' performance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general feeling is that the players will give Saturday's encounter their best, with the knowledge that the country, the continent and indeed, lovers of African soccer are behind them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one Nigerian commentator, &quot;silver is assured, but gold is the ultimate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commending the players, Nigeria's Information Minister, Walter Ofonagoro, said their exploits &quot;demonstrate the Nigerian spirit, to show his class when you think he is down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers have suggested that the country apply the same spirit in solving its lingering political problem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - The ban on &quot;franco valuta&quot; was a long awaited measure which will enhance legal transaction, secretary of the Addis Ababa Chamber of Commerce said here yesterday. Businessmen used to engage in franco valuta, however, voiced complaints.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview with journalists at a foreign exchange auction, the secretary said the banning of franco valuta would help curb illegal trade and pave the way for the expansion of legal transactions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions that allowed businessmen to use a portion of the hard currency they earned with the right to sell the balance to banks at prices fixed at their own discretion indicated the translation into practice of the free market policy besides building investors' confidence on the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The permission for the purchase of foreign currency from commercial banks would facilitate transaction and the expansion of small-scale and intermediate industries, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Getu Gebre-Yes from the Caravan Automotive Private Company said the measure would benefit legal businessmen and ward off the importation of low- quality goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the permission for exporters to use part of their hard currency earnings would help reduce wastage of foreign exchange abroad in addition to minimising trade on the black market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Had the National Bank of Ethiopia established a strong modern market intelligence section, the change effected could have been highly advantageous to business undertakings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban on franco valuta would adversely affect businessmen with meagre resources, a trader who asked for anonymity said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two businessmen from Dubai Tera here in the Merkato area said the demand for foreign exchange from banks and the process to follow is time-consuming and would have contacts with different traders. Franco valuta on the other hand creates an opportunity to communicate with various suppliers, they added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ATHENS, United States (PANA) - Nigeria's under-23 soccer team has already assured itself a place in history by taking the country to its first Olympic soccer final, but the best is yet to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When members of the &quot;dream team&quot; line up against Argentina at the Sanford stadium in Athens saturday, only one sign will be in their eyes: gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria has never won the (soccer) trophy and we have come all the way to win it,&quot; says the team skipper, Nwankwo Kanu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His confidence is well placed. After all, which other team is there in the soccer world to intimidate a squad that came back from two goals down to beat the world's best, Brazil?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the road to Nigeria's first-ever Olympic gold is paved with spikes, to be thrown every inch of the way by Argentina, itself seeking its first-ever Olympic soccer gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argentina is a powerhouse in soccer, having twice won the much-covered world title. But it has never won an Olympic soccer gold, and it has been 68 years since the country last got a chance to play for one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The implication is that the Daniel Passarella-coached team will be at its best on Saturday and a pivot in its quest for victory will be one of its youngest players, 21-year-old forward Crespo Hernan, who scored the two goals in his team's semi-final win over Portugal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hernan has so far scored five goals in the competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Nigeria, its confidence boosted sky-high by the dramatic despatch of giant Brazil in the semi-finals, seems to have come too far enough to allow any team, no matter who anchors its play, to kill its dreams.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If Argentina is coming out to play all their best, we are also coming out to play all our best,&quot; said Kanu, the two-goal hero of Wednesday's 4-3 victory over Brazil, articulating his team's determination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nobody is better placed than the head of the Nigerian soccer, retired air commodore Emeka Omeruah, to know that Kanu's assertion is not an idle boast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The boys just don't want anything else (but gold),&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are on the threshold of history,&quot; declared Kanu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Technical adviser Johanes Bonfrere is as expected, keeping his strategies for the match under wraps, though the players' schedule had included a full day rest Thursday and &quot;light training&quot; Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hope is that on Saturday, the players will be driven by the realisation that they represent the hopes of a nation and a continent, in what may well be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. Words of encouragement as well as donations and pledges have been pouring in as incentives for the west Africans to conquer the soccer world.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - Zambia on Monday applauded Nigeria's stunning 3-2 soccer victory over Argentina at the Atlanta Olympics Saturday, becoming the first African country to win gold in Olympic soccer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned Zambia Daily Mail newspaper said the &quot;Dream Team's&quot; victory was an honour to Nigeria, Africa and an indication of the continent's potential to compete on equal terms with the world's best players.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Very few people outside Africa thought one day there would be a team eloquent enough to capture peoples' imagination with stunning brilliance.  Nigeria has proved them wrong.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And it is from this, that other African nations should take a leaf.  Nigeria is not the only team capable of upsetting tables and demonstrating Africa's prowess at football,&quot; said the mail in an editorial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian soccer fans had Saturday remained glued to their television sets to cheer their 1994 Africa cup &quot;soccer foes&quot; against the Latin Americans who had been widely tipped by most soccer observers and commentators to lift the gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria's victory is Africa's and our victory,&quot; said one excited soccer fan at a local bar in Lusaka immediately after the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is only fitting that we should celebrate with Nigeria for putting Africa on the world soccer map,&quot; said another soccer fan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia national soccer team had itself &quot;almost made history&quot; at the 1988 Seoul Olympics after putting up a splendid, albeit shortlived, performance against some of the the world's best soccer nations, including Italy who were beaten 4-0. The Zambian team beat Guatemala by the same margin after drawing 2-2 against Iraq but faltered 0-4 against West German at the quarter-finals. The Germans went on to lift the cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's dreams to win the continental soccer cup for the first time in 1994 in Tunisia was thwarted by Nigeria's Emmanuel Amunike's two goals in the finals. Nigeria won 2-1 to become Africa's 1994 soccer champions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amunike, who Saturday came on as substitute, clinched Nigeria's winning goal and became the Zambians instant hero as the minutes ticked to the final whistle. &quot;Amunike, Amunike, Kanu, Kanu, Nigeria, Nigeria,&quot; exclaimed excited soccer fans who watched the game at an outdoor resort in Lusaka's sprawling Chilenje township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the Zambians excitement over Nigeria's victory, despite the two country's &quot;soccer enmity&quot; since 1994, the Mail said &quot;football disciples remember, how in 1994 Nigeria 'robbed' Zambia of a chance to win for the first time, the African football championship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; Nigerian players, in terms of soccer have not been on top of the favourite person's list and the average Zambian fan would certainly want another crack at what has become the power-house of African soccer. But certainly not even the fanatical type could suppress a grin when Nigeria, coming from behind, humbled one of the world's greatest football teams,&quot; the Mail added. Sports-Nigeria-Biya OAU Chairman Congratulates Nigerian Soccer Team</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">YAOUNDE, Cameroon (PANA) - The current Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), President Paul Biya of Cameroon, has commended the Nigerian Olympic team for snatching the soccer gold medal Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a congratulation message to his Nigerian counterpart, Gen. Sani Abacha, Biya praised the team &quot;for making Africa proud&quot; at the just-ended Olympics in Atlanta, United States, where it beat Argentina 3-2 in the final.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Biya's was cabled from Europe where he is on a private tour since Saturday, Cameroon News Agency reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted in his cable that Nigeria's brilliant success confirmed the great strides taken by the west African country's soccer in particular and Africa in general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cameroonian president had sent similar congratulations to Gen. Abacha and President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana when their respective under-23 teams qualified for the Olympic semi-finals. Ghana lost to Argentina while Nigeria sailed through with an epic 4-3 victory over much-fancied Brazil.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia (PANA) - African exports to the United States, mainly oil, earned it 12.6 billion dollars in 1995, representing a 12-percent rise over the continent's 1994 exports to the U.S..</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report in the latest issue of 'Washington Line,' a State Department publication, attributed the improved earnings to significant expansion of some African economies due to current economic and democratic reforms.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures were presented by U.S. government officials, business executives and African lobbyists at a recent congressional hearing in Washington that discussed a proposed new U.S-Africa trade initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials noted, however, that while some African countries had made significant economic gains following the liberalization and democratic reforms, more needed to be done to stimulate the role of the private sector on the continent to promote its integration into the global marketplace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, George Moose, said the region achieved measurable progress towards sustainable economic growth through more efficient use of resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposed U.S-Africa trade initiative, dubbed 'Mcdermott-Crane' trade initiative, envisages the creation of a U.S-Africa free trade area by the year 2010. This will be in addition to the U.S-Africa economic cooperation and a trade and investment partnership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics quoted at the hearing indicated there was a 3.8-percent average real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in the region during 1995. It was the highest growth rate so far in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several countries undergoing economic and democratic reforms, including Botswana, Ghana and Mauritius, recorded more than 4 percent GDP growth during the period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moose noted that while higher commodity prices were part of the reasons for the improved performance by these countries, it also reflected the positive impact of the effective development programmes and better economic policies being pursued by the states concerned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - South African vice president Thabo Mbeki Tuesday reiterated his government's full support for the OAU stand on Burundi, where a conflict between the Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after more than two hours of talks with OAU secretary general, Salim Ahmed Salim, at the organization's headquarters here, Mbeki also urged Burundi's Tutsi-dominated military regime to seek peace with its opponents, mainly the Hutu majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki's delegation, which included foreign minister Alfred Nzo, met Monday in Dar Es Salaam with former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who is leading an OAU peace initiative for Burundi, and with Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa. The South African vice president said the stand of Burundi's seven neighboring states on the conflict in the tiny central African state and that of the OAU had been explained to his delegation during Monday's and Tuesday's meetings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have also made South Africa's position clear: Full support for the OAU stand and the decisions taken by the recent Arusha summit,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi's neighboring states at the summit last week condemned the July 25 coup led by the former head of state, Maj. Pierre Buyoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki said his delegation would report the outcome of its mission to the South African government Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if South Africa's possible contribution to an intervention force for Burundi had been discussed during his meetings at the OAU and in Dar es salaam, Mbeki said: &quot;You don't need the use of force to secure peace and stability in Burundi.&quot; Salim, meanwhile, said it was not too late to bring peace to Burundi which many fear could slide into the type of genocide that rocked Rwanda in 1994, which claimed up to one million lives. &quot;It is not late, even at this hour, for all parties in Burundi to abide by the call of the Arusha summit for a negotiated settlement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also disclosed he had a meeting Monday with a special envoy of Buyoya, who had briefed him on the stand of the new military regime in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salim said he had explained to the envoy, in no uncertain terms, that the OAU wanted to see the restoration of a legal government in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, however, that the OAU would talk to any of Burundi's factions for the sake of peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (PANA) - One person was killed while 11 other were injured, four of them seriously, when a powerful bomb ripped through the bar and lounge of an Addis Ababa hotel early Monday night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State radio quoted police as saying the bomb extensively damaged the Wabe Shebelle hotel in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police immediately cordoned off Ras Abede Argegay street, the main thoroughfare on which the 11-floor, three-star hotel is located, and the adjacent streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eye witnesses said the explosion occurred when the ground floor bar, lounge and dance floor, were crowded with customers. The explosion caused heavy damage to glass panels of the eastern and northern sections of the ground floor of the hotel and completely shattered the entire bar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A similar explosion on January 19, at another government-run hotel, the plush Ghion Hotel in downtown Addis Ababa, ripped off the frontal section of the hotel, killing three people and injuring 15 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two weeks later, another explosion, in the eastern town of Dire Dawa, 500 kms (312 miles) from Addis Ababa, also caused extensive damage to the government-owned Ras Hotel, killing one person and injuring four others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responsibility for the attacks on the two hotels in Addis Ababa and the one in Dire Dawa, was claimed by an Ethiopian separatist group, Al Itihad, from Mogadishu, Somalia, last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Itihad seeks secession for the Ethiopian Somali region from the rest of federated Ethiopia. The group also claimed responsibility for the attempt on the life of a senior Ethiopian minister of Somali origin in Addis Ababa early in July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abdulmegid Hussein, minister of transport and communications, was shot six times on the arm, shoulder and throat, on July 8 in front of his office as he arrived for work in the morning. His bodyguard and another security officer were killed by the unidentified assailants, who managed to escape.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - The vast majority of the South African public would support President Nelson Mandela if he opted for the country's participation in peace-keeping operations in Burundi, or anywhere else, according to a survey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey, on national security issues, was conducted by the Institute for Defence Policy and the Human Sciences Research Council, and reported in the Johannesburg newspaper, The Star.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was released on the eve of a Defence Consultative Conference which will assess the future needs of the South African defence force for the next decade. The conference will determine such elements as force levels, new ships, aircraft and other equipment, part-time forces, and security trends in Southern Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The survey revealed that the majority of all population groups believed that a strong defence force was either necessary or essential. Only 20 percent of those interviewed felt it was unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another trend to emerge strongly from the survey was the belief that the South African Defence Force had a specific role to play in the Southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost three-quarters of the respondents felt the South African Defence Force should play an active role in maintaining stability in Southern Africa; 63 percent believed it should defend the borders of other countries in the region; 73 percent favored South African training of other military personnel in the region; and 67 percent said South Africa should provide equipment to the other powers in Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A large majority of those questioned (almost two-thirds) believed South Africa should have a peace-keeping force to assist other countries in maintaining peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly half were in favour of such a force serving anywhere in the world.  Of these, almost half believed the force should always be under South African command, while just over a third felt the force should be prepared to serve under foreign command when required.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbabane, Swaziland (PANA) - Criticism voiced at the recent annual general meeting of the South African Sugar Association concerning what its members viewed as unfair competition from imported cheaper Swazi sugar has drawn a sharp reaction from the Swaziland Sugar Association. The South Africans were reported to have complained that the free flow of sugar imports from Swaziland and Zimbabwe at cheaper prices than South African grown sugar presented unfair competition to South African growers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an interview here with PANA, the Swaziland Sugar Association general manager, Andy Colhoun, said the South African complaint was totally unjustified considering the imbalance in the total trade situation between the two countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Swaziland is a member of the Southern African Common Customs Union along with South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Lesotho which provides for the fostering of the free flow of goods and services across the borders of these member states. Zimbabwe, as in the case of Mozambique and Angola, is not a member of the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is heavy imbalance of total trade in favour of South Africa which exports a vast range of goods and services to Swaziland everyday, said Colhoun. These include petrol, oil, electricity, wines, fruits and vegetables, among others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Almost two billion rands (nearly half a billion U.S. dollars) worth of South African goods are imported by Swaziland each year, whereas Swaziland total exports to South Africa amounts to only about 780 million rands (about 173 million dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colhoun said since sugar is a product in which Swaziland has an advantage due to its good climate and soils, excellent labor resources and a high level of managerial expertise, Swazi sugar locally termed &quot;Swazi gold&quot;, helps redress the balance of trade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a simple case of economics, said Colhoun. Swaziland is a small landlocked country with comparatively fewer resources than South Africa and must be allowed to use those resources to its best advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colhoun said &quot;the whole of the Southern African Common Customs Union is based on a market economy in which competition is inherent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African sugar industry, he added, must be prepared to face competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I did not want to get married until my plan to win an Olympic gold medal came to fruition. And now, I guess, it is time to get tied to the girl I have chosen some time ago,&quot; Haile told Ethiopian Radio sports reporter Demisie Damte in Atlanta.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I promised her (his fiancee) that we would get married after my victory at the Olympic games. I gave precedence to the Olympic gold medal. And that is why I held my marriage a secret,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he wanted the celebration marking his wedding to kick off right after his arrival at the airport to make it &quot;special&quot; and &quot;memorable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haile, who has become the richest national athlete of all times, said flamboyantly that he will now turn his face to meeting his social obligations of helping his family &quot;I will keep running in the meantime,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gold medal chasing athlete, whose dazzling performance in the 10,000 meter Olympic race, left Ethiopians and people across the world pop-eyed with amazement hopes to receive a warm welcome on arrival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to comment on whether he expects an elaborate festive at the airport Haile said between laughters, &quot;I warn the airport staff to do their level best to make my betrothal day a success.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is expected that there would be a massive gathering of fans choking terminal waiting areas to welcome and congratulate the Ethiopian athletics team including Haile, one of the best athletes the world has produced in age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haile's victory in the 10,000 meter race has fuelled the excitement generated by the performance of Fatuma Roba who outdistanced her compititors to win the 42,195 km women marathon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Haile and Fatuma earned Ethiopian two gold medals while athlete Gete Wami won bronze in the 10,000 meter race. Haile could not compete in the 5000 meter because of a wound in his feet.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa (ENA) - Six members of the clandestine and self styled &quot; Ethiopian National Patriots Front (ENPF)&quot; yesterday appeared before the Second Criminal Bench of the Federal High Court and heard to a 3 page charge filed against them by the Prosecutor General's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the charge, they stand accused of allegedly &quot;establishing an armed underground political organization in which they worked as leader and members with the aim of usurping power from the constitutionally elected government and inciting organized terror and chaos in the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if they had any objection to the charge, the defendants including, the former president of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association and now chairman of the said &quot;terrorist gang&quot; Dr. Taye Wolde Semayet - said that they would consult their lawyers before saying anything about the case. They instead appealed to the court to grant them bail, which the Prosecutor General dismissed outright.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prosecutor General objected to making the grant saying: &quot;Since they are accused of grave offences which will entail severe punishment, it is most unlikely that they will reappear once they are granted bail. Moreover, since their collaborators have not yet been arrested, a bail would mean the continuation of their illegal deeds; since, too, the witnesses testifying for the Prosecutor General are individuals selected with utmost care and deserve strict legal protection, the bailing of the defendants will almost certainly mean the elimination or attempted persuasion by the defendants and their collaborators of the witnesses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court will decide today on whether to grant or refuse bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the hearing began defendant number one, Dr. Taye Wolde Semayat, objected to the presence of a press camera crew which the court rejected. He then took off his coat and concealed his face with it only to put it on again following order by the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other defendants included: Ato Kebede Desta, former president of the Veteran Teachers' Association; Ato Gebretsadik Hailemariam, Lt. Chane Tolla; Ato Talegeta Leul (Dagne), and captain Moges Assefa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Atlanta - The Centennial Olympic Games closed on Sunday night with fireworks, music, tears and appeals to global brotherhood before a capacity crowd of 85,000 at Olympic Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 10:40 pm, the Olympic flame, lit 17 days before, was extinguished minutes after Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell presented the Olympic flag to Frank Sartor, mayor of Sydney, Australia, site of the 2,000 Summer Games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Atlanta Games were the biggest in Olympic history, with 11,000 athletes from 197 countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Well done, Atlanta,&quot; declared Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. &quot;For 100 years the Olympic Games have inspired great dreams. Today, the dream has come true for Atlanta, which will be forever an Olympic city.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Samaranch praised the competition, but at a press conference earlier on Sunday he criticized the commercialisation of the Atlanta Olympics and mentioned &quot;problems&quot; in &quot;transportation and technology.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Billy Payne, president of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, praised Atlanta for rallying in the wake of a July 27 terror bombing at Centennial Olympic Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Musicians like Stevie Wonder, Gloria Estefan, B.B. King, Little Richard, Wynton Marsalis and Tito Puente took part in the musical portion of a three- hour event that concluded with thousands of athletes on the field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The host nation enjoyed two last successes on the athletic front, winning the women's basketball gold medal and a surprise boxing gold. The United States finished atop the medal standings for the first time in a non- boycotted Olympics since 1968, winning 101 medals, 44 gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Germany won 65 medals. Russia, competing without athletes from several breakaway Soviet republics, was second in gold with 26. But the days of overwhelming dominance by a few nations are over. A record 197 nations took part and an unprecented 79 won at least one medal. Fifty-three countries got at least one gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K200 Million Grant for Power Project In Malawi - The German government is to provide a K200 million (US$13.34 million) grant to Malawi for the country's new hydro-electric scheme, Kapichira, in south Malawi. The signing ceremony for this took place on July 18 in Lilongwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance Minister, Aleke Banda, who signed the agreement on behalf of the Malawi government, said the Kapichira project would enable the country to supply adequate electricity to the country's urban, peri-urban and rural areas and will provide an alternative source of energy to ease the burden on fuel wood and charcoal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Acting German Ambassador to Malawi, Dr Wolfgang Klapper, signing on behalf of his government said the extension of Malawi's present electricity supply was essential for the country's future since demand for electricity would exceed current electricity production by the end of the decade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main financier of the project is the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The War Against Polio in Malawi - Malawi, on July 17, launched a countrywide campaign to immunise over 2,000,000 children against polio. It is estimated that the lives of nearly 300,000 children could be saved each year through the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Health Organisation-funded campaign is targeting children aged between one to five years. The Acting WHO representative in Malawi, Chris Forshaw, hopes that polio will be eradicated by raising coverage of routine immunisation and by supplementary immunisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi government has taken the opportunity to simultaneously administer supplementary oral vitamin A, the deficiency of which is said to be ''very common among Malawian children under 5 year of age.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi to Get First 5-Star Hotel - Malawi's first five star hotel is to shoot up in sight of the New State House in Lilongwe, which is slated to be turned into an international conference centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cabinet has approved a K780 million (US$52 million) project to be undertaken at the extravagant - K700 million (US 46.67 million) - State House built by former president Kamuzu Banda, in order to convert the presently under-utilised facility into a commercial entity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Chief Economist in the Economic Planning and Development Ministry, Dr Henry Ng'ombe, said a 200-rooms hotel will be built in the complex yard to supplement the tourist facilities being planned for the premises, adding that the present buildings will be commercialised by offering international conference facilities and other recreation services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several local companies are lined up ready to participate in this colossal venture with foreign companies also bidding for partnership shares. The project is expected to start before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government Must Retrench Or Perish - The World Bank Resident representative in Malawi, Arif Zulfiqar, said July 18 that the government could choose to retrench some civil servants and succeed with the civil service reform programme, or avoid retrenchment and perish by perpetuating inefficiency and unnecessary public spending.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulfiqar said that the World Bank could not make the decisions for the government though the bank was committed to assisting the Malawi government in its reform programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was reacting to the Secretary to the President and cabinet Alfred Upindi's recent statement that government had shelved the retrenchment programme due to financial problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zulfiqar said that if the government decides not to retrench, it should be prepared to face problems like strikes for salary increases, since it is not possible to offer attractive wages to the present oversized civil service. He also said that any improperly planned salary increases now would result in a budget deficit and possibly a rise in inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prisoners Plea for Clemency - Prisoners serving various sentences in Malawi's jails still face problems communicating with the outside world despite claims of transparency and reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several inmates had to secretly smuggle letters out of Zomba Central Prison during a visit there recently by a group of human rights activists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several letters, one of which is believed to have been written by ex-army Colonel James Njoloma and addressed to President Bakili Muluzi asking for clemency, were passed on to the visitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Njoloma is serving a 14-year sentence after a court martial found him guilty of organising a mutiny. He is kept in the section of the prison reserved for prisoners awaiting capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prison authorities said, however, that they were surprised that prisoners had to secretly send letters out of prison. They said the system was open. A member of the prison authorities did, however, confirm that all letters from prisoners are opened by the prison authorities and vetted before they are sent out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi Polytechnic Closes Down - The Malawi Polytechnic, a constituent college of the University of Malawi, was closed indefinitely on July 18 until the authorities concerned address demands by lecturers for salary increments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The closure has resulted in students not being able to take their examinations. The students were advised to vacate the campus on July 19 and wait until the salary issue is resolved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lilongwe - Life in Malawi's prisons is turning out to be hell, report human rights activists who visited the country's biggest central prison in Zomba, south Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although government is making an effort to reform the institution - largely due to the prodding of international organisations like the Red Cross and Amnesty International - Malawi's prisons remain death traps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Executive Director of Malawi Democratic Institute of Economic Affairs, Shyley Kondowe, leading a delegation that visited the maximum security prison in Zomba, said that statistics on the health of inmates and their general welfare are chilling. Kondowe said, referring to the health of inmates, that there is a high prevalence of diseases such as tuberculosis and scabies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that between January and June this year, 26.4% of the inmates at the prison were suffering from TB and in addition, 58.8% of them had TB/HIV related complications with 17.6% of prisoners having full-blown AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is even more pathetic is that medication for the patients is almost non-existent. &quot;There were cases where some prisoners who have TB were being given aspirin because drugs are not available,'' said Kondowe. Apart from the lack of drugs, Kondowe said, the prison's medical system is greatly undermined by lack of personnel and equipment. The incidence of disease is exacerbated by the diet, which Kondowe described as ''extremely low.'' Prisoners are still served only one meal a day which makes it even more difficult for inmates suffering from TB to recuperate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kondowe said his group encountered a case where nsima (the local staple food - a thick porridge), that had been prepared some two days earlier, was still being served to the inmates. &quot;The beans that served with nsima are rotten,&quot; Kondowe said. He said this results in a high rate of deaths, a rate always on the increase inside the prison walls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kondowe said eight people had died during the past two weeks at Zomba Central Prison alone, representing a death rate of one person every two days.  ''We saw a number of sick prisoners sleeping out on the floor, left for dead, and uncared for. They were in a very pathetic situation because nobody was attending to them.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most prisoners have no blankets and there is overcrowding in the cells, some of which house as many as 20 inmates when they are obviously designed for far fewer people. Prisons Public Relations Officer Winston Manyela bemoaned the situation and blamed the lack of facilities like blankets, uniforms and other basic equipment for prisoners on the meagre financial allocations made by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kondowe also commented on the fact that some 800 remandees on homicide cases have not been taken to court. Director of Public Prosecutions, Kamudoni Nyasulu, also blamed this on the inadequate funding by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given enough funds, he said, he would hire lawyers in private practice to deal with the cases adding that unless there is an adequate cash injection into public prosecution, trial of the 800 remandees held in the various prisons would not be completed within the next two years. He said his department currently needs US$500,000 to prosecute the homicide remandees, some of whom have already spent two years in waiting in prison.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some human rights organisations are recommending the establishment of a special tribunal to examine the cases and grant the remandees bail. But, Nyasulu said, the setting up of a tribunal would not solve the problem. For a tribunal to operate, he said, it needs the involvement of legal aid, the judiciary and the prosecution. &quot;If there is money, why not give it to these three sections?&quot; he queried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kondowe also said that torture equipment, such as straight jackets, was still being kept in the prison. He said this was a violation of human rights, adding that some prison authorities might be tempted to use them on the inmates. He recommended that they be taken to a museum.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tunis - President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali reiterated Tunisia's commitment to the Middle East Peace Process and its support of the &quot;land for peace&quot; formula as one of the principles agreed upon in the peace accords.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking Thursday at the closing session of the annual Conference of Ambassadors and Chiefs of Consular Missions, the President said &quot;our major concern is to see that the interests of the Palestinian people prevail, and to confirm their rights and those of all Arab parties, in a framework of respect of international law and of the principles set forth in the Oslo, Madrid, Washington and Cairo agreements, particularly the principle of &quot;land for peace.&quot; He added, &quot;as we note certain recent indications that seem to favor resumption of the peace process, we reiterate our confidence that the two co-sponsors of the peace process, and particularly the United States, will work to stimulate this process, to encourage all parties to respect the agreements reached and to prevent any regression or attempt to create a new fait accompli that might endanger future security and stability in the region.  &quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President emphasized Tunisia's principled stand against extremism and terrorism. He said that the resurgence of this phenomenon &quot;is now endangering security and stability in numerous countries of both North and South.&quot; But he noted &quot;the evolution that has occurred, albeit somewhat late, within the international community in its perception of the seriousness of this phenomenon, and curtailing its effects.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said that the international community &quot;must go beyond simple considerations of security&quot; in trying to find solutions to extremism and terrorism, but rather &quot;give real impetus to cooperation and solidarity in favor of the development and the economic expansion of Third World countries, with the adoption of social policies designed to prevent poverty, marginalization and exclusion within different societies, in such a way as to eliminate the factors that feed this phenomenon and favor its expansion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Ali addressed also in his speech Tunisia's relations with other countries. He said &quot;we will continue our attempts to strengthen relations with our traditional partners in our Arab, European and Mediterranean environment, and to intensify dialogue and concerted effort with the countries of the European Union, in a manner that will serve our mutual interests and develop partnership and cooperation in all fields.&quot; He mentioned his recent to Japan as an example of Tunisia's outreach to other parts of the world as &quot;dictated by the imperatives of economic globalization and by the necessity for opening the broadest possible horizons for our country, which has undertaken to meet the challenge of openness and progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Full text of speech is available on the Tunisia Online website (http://www.  TunisiaOnline.com/news/news.html).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - They're supposed to be in Abuja, the nation's capital, for the brain-racking and energy-sapping process of meeting the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria's guidelines for the registration of parties. But for most politicians, the trip to Abuja is just another opportunity to attempt to kill two birds with a stone. Barely a month to the end of the third quarter of the year, set aside for the state and local government creation exercise, politicians, whose future fortunes will be affected by who gets what state and how, have intensified lobby on behalf of their anticipated future electorate. They are equally concerned, Theweek has learnt, with how government goes about the state and local government creation exercise, in order to enable them map out appropriate strategies for coming elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No doubt, the politicians are already campaigning by another means and will return during electioneering to claim their reward from the ever gullible electorate. But theirs is just a part of last-minute moves by Nigerians desperate to realise their dreams of getting new states and local government areas.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before now, desperation on the part of the agitators has peaked in the last days of the Committee on State and Local Government Creation and Boundary Adjustment. There are allegations that some state agitators had sought to help their case by giving money to some members of the committee. The collection of &quot;mobilisation fee,&quot; as it was called by some state champions claiming to be acting in the interest of their people, reportedly went on till July 1. On that day Arthur Mbanefo, chairman of the committee had dismissed allegations of bribery against committee members and challenged those with evidence to the contrary to publish names of those who collected money from them. Mbanefo threw the challenge shortly after he submitted the report of the committee to Sani Abacha, the head of state. He insisted that the committee received gifts from state governments but not from agitators for states and local governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hundreds of Nigerians from a minority ethnic group who gathered in a hall in Surulere, Lagos, around the time the committee submitted its report, would be the last to take up Mbanefo's challenge, as that would amount to betraying one of their sons. The meeting, held under the auspices of the Lagos chapter of a national social club headquartered in a state the agitators want to split into two, hit a climax when the club president intimated members with a juicy directive from the parent body. He announced that members of the club nationwide were required to make financial contribution towards a N4 million fund. The money, according to the parent body, was to be used to bribe the members of the committee on State Creation. For the avoidance of doubt, members were told that a prominent indigene who, incidentally, was a member of the State Creation Committee, advised on this course of action. A sense of urgency dawned on the meeting and members agreed to act quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the northern parts of the country, the money was also evident. A source simply described it as forced taxation. He disclosed that some prominent persons were even blackmailed into making substantial financial contributions to a fund. In the case of the New Kaduna State Movement, well-to-do Zaria sons were made to pay to a fund as proof that they were not against the creation of the dream state fully supported by Shehu Idris, the Emir of Zaria.  The money, said the collectors, was needed for transportation to Abuja, lodging and secretariat costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek could, however, not confirm if money actually changed hands between state movement organisers and the state creation committee members.  Investigations showed that some smart members of the movements scattered all over the country might have helped themselves to the money collected under the pretext that it would be used to bribe members of the Mbanefo committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, campaigners for new states and local governments are seeking to make maximum use of their contacts in government. The Paul Zakka and Bashir Ikara group which also want a state from Kaduna are said to be looking up to Jerry Useni, minister of the federal capital territory, whom they expect to protect the interests of the Middle Belt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the citizens of Ifelodun local government in Kwara State, their dream for a local government to be known as Ifesowapo is said to be as good as realised. Rahim Oladimeji, a businessman who donated N5 million at the state launch of the Family Support Programme, is said to have concluded the lobby for the creation of the said local government, with his home town Igbaja as the proposed headquarters. Oladipo Diya, the Chief of General Staff, has reportedly assured his Ijebu kith and kin that an Ijebu State would not elude them this time. His only demand is that his town, Odogbolu, be made the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some agitators, money and contacts are not enough. In this category are members of the Itai State Movement in Akwa Ibom State. For some time now they have been holding special prayer sessions in furtherance of their cause.  Shortly before the State Creation Committee concluded its 30-state tour during which it received requests and statistical data from agitators, Itai Movement called on its members to pray to God to touch the heart of Mbanefo and his committee members so that their Itai State would be recommended and subsequently created. Seeking to warm its way into Abacha's heart, the group had earlier bought space in some national dailies to condole the head of state on the death of his son, Ibrahim, in the January 17 fatal plane crash near kano.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simple as its tactics are, Itai State Movement has by its tenacity and publicity made the proposed state to look like a reality, at least in its immediate vicinity. The Akwa Ibom State government is said to be so scared stiff of a possible Itai State that it is trying to frustrate the movements efforts. The state polytechnic at Ikot Osurua, Ikot Ekpene, possible capital of the proposed Itai State, is allegedly being starved of funds by the government. Ikot Ekpene, the second biggest town in Akwa Ibom, after Uyo, is said to have been gratefully excluded from any official investment in the current efforts by the state government to give major towns in the state a face-lift.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same non-investment mentality reigns supreme among the Izon of Rivers State, although self-imposed. The fourth largest ethnic group in the country and presently shared among several states, the Izon are said to be so sure of at least a state that they have heeded calls by some of their leaders not to invest a kobo in Rivers State until the state creation exercise takes place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the other extreme, the New Delta State movement appears to have given up the struggle. But it may not have totally lost out. The Delta State capital, Theweek learnt, may be moved from Asaba to a neutral ground between Isoko and Ukwani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some who are campaigning for new states are acting out of ethnic or patriotic sentiments, others like Mamman Nasir, Transition Implementation Committee chairman, may be doing so for other considerations. On retirement from the Bench in 1992, the former president of the Appeal Court was turbaned the district head of Malumfashi with an eye to the emirship of Katsina.  Sources say he was not the choice of the Emir of Zaria. The dissolved National Republican Convention which was then in charge in the state was said to have set up a machinery to create more emirates to accommodate Nasir, but was stopped by the legislature controlled by the defunct Social Democratic Party. The scrapping of the political structures almost dashed Nasir's hopes.  Still nursing the ambition of becoming Emir, Nasir is said to have thrown his weight behind the campaign for the creation of Kaduna State out of Katsina despite the recommendation against it by a committee set up to look into the potentiality of the envisaged state. Kaduna, if created, would comprise Bakori, Daya, Funtua, Mutaza and other fertile and industrialised areas of southern Katsina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ball is obviously in the court of the committee set up by the federal government to study and review Mbanefo's committee recommendations. The Mbanefo committee is said to have recommended that rather than create new state that would depend on the federation account for survival, existing ones should be restructured to make them economically viable. Hot on the heels of the submission of the committee's report came speculations that some areas like Lagos State might be dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alarmed by this possibility, Lagos State obas, chiefs and senior indigenes met last week and called on the federal government to discard the idea. Lagos State, the committee, known as the Eminent Persons Group, argued remains the most viable state in the federation. The committee was particularly irked by the alleged plans to merge parts of the state with parts of Ogun to create Ijebu State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olagunsoye Oyinlola, the Lagos military administrator, later dismissed the speculations. But to some, that is not reassuring enough. Indeed, until new states and local governments are eventually created, the lobbying is bound to continue on different planes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Disloyal government officials provide the Ghanaian opposition the ammunition with which to fight Jerry Rawlings, incumbent president and front- runner in the December presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Heat is on, as president Jerry Rawlings and his National Democratic Coalition could testify. As the December presidential election approaches, the opposition is making every effort to paint the president in bad light by exposing what it considers his wasteful spending of tax payers' money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Just recently, the opposition hit town with the story that sources at the Ghanaian embassy in Washington, have revealed that President Rawlings, through Ekwow Spio-Garbar, Ghana's ambassador to the USA, spent about half a million dollars in the past nine months to shore up his image in America.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition has it that about 400,00 dollars was paid to Burston- Masteller, a public relations firm, between October last year and now, to help make Rawlings look like an angel in the eyes of American congressmen and officials so that they could support Rawlings in the December polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is also alleged that Ambassador Spio-Garbar signed an agreement with Mickel H. Williams, the PR firm's administrative officer, providing for the firm to be paid 40,000 dollars per month plus out-of-pocket expenses, in return for publicity for President Rawlings. The contract was for an initial three months period, but subject to renewal for the same sum of 40,00 dollars monthly as retainer fees, excluding out-of-pocket expenses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, the payment to Burston-Masteller was made via bank transfer to account Number 890-022954, ABA NO. 021-000-18, Bank of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition claims that money expended on public relations for Ghana and Rawlings is a big waste as Rawlings himself has helped to erase whatever gains that could have come from the PR campaign. By the end of last January, the initial expiratory period for the contract, Rawlings had had problems with Kow Arkaah, his vice-president, which resulted in a physical attack on Arkaah by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government spy called Frank Bennen, who was working at the Ghana UN Mission in Geneva, Switzerland, had also put Rawlings in an embarrassing situation. He was arrested for drug dealing and later revealed &quot;too many things&quot; which were not in the government's favour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To worsen matters for Rawlings, Samuel Okine, a government spy attached to the Ghana High Commission in London, had problems with the police and defected to the USA, where his public utterances caused a lot of damage to Rawlings' image.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although these events were a big blow to Burston-Marsteller's efforts, Ambassador Spio-Garba was undaunted. Apparently with government's support, he has renewed the PR contract with the American firm and has paid at least another 100,000 dollars to Burston-Marsteller. Details of the new contract are yet to be made public.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of last week, the presidency and the ruling NDC were yet to officially deny the allegations by the opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source at the presidency who spoke to Theweek however, dismissed the allegations as one of the ploys by the opposition to discredit President Rawlings. &quot;Look, my friend,&quot; do you take these people seriously?&quot; asked the source. &quot;They are jokers.&quot; Is there any government that does not spend money on public relations? Don't bother about them. They are just being petty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked why so much money was paid to a firm for public relations when the government has its own information and PR unit at the Ghana Mission in the USA, the official explained that the job of publicity is always better handled by an independent, professional firm. &quot;The Mission may be too busy doing other things,&quot; he told Theweek. &quot;What is wrong with giving the job to professionals? Doesn't the Nigerian government do the same?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - For months before his ouster last Thursday by the military, President Sylvester Ntibantunganya of Burundi would not hear of the idea, let alone tolerate the suggestion of foreign military intervention in his war- torn country. Six months ago he fell back on the vague notion of territorial sovereignty to rebuff a United Nation's planned peace keeping force. He would equally not cooperate with an African peace initiative of ex-President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, Ntibantunganya and his fragile coalition government, badly shaken by events that followed the murder of over 304 Tutsi civilians by Hutu rebels, made a sharp U-turn. He echoed more forcefully the call of his prime minister, Antoine Nduwayo, who agreed June 28 to support a plan for an African peace keeping force.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But before any help could come its way, the beleaguered regime was sacked by the Burundian Army, which swiftly installed Pierre Buyoya, the country's former military leader from 1987 to 1993, as the new head of state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During their brief and controversial reign, Nitbantunganya and Nduwayo's hands were filled by bloodshed. A day before the prime minister's turn-around, 1,000 civilian Hutus had been slaughtered at Cibitoke, a refugee camp northwest of Burundi. Rwandan Tutsi soldiers who are said to be allied with their counterparts in neighbouring Burundi, were implicated in the killings.  Three weeks later on July 20, Hutu rebels took a revenge. Wielding knives, machetes and guns, the rebels numbering about 1,000, descended on the central Burundian town of Giteg in the early morning of that Saturday. They attacked the military guards, women and children and then burnt some of the over 304 dead bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the burial ceremony for the deceased last Tuesday, aggrieved Tutsis assaulted their president. They rained stone on him, forcing him to flee to safety in the residence of the American ambassador to Burundi. From his hide- out, Ntibantunganya made a broadcast to his people, appealing for calm and peace. The military which defied strong international warnings not to re-take power, late last week advised him to voluntarily surrender himself to the new regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before it fell, the panic-stricken government had stared expelling about 3, 000 Rwandan Hutus who had been taking refuge in Burundi since the outbreak of violence in their own country in 1994. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees condemned the forced repatriation. Even before the coup, the crisis had taken a toll on politics. Unity for National Progress, the main opposition party, a coalition partner to the government, was badly rattled by the latest bloodletting. As the main opposition in government, UPRONA was represented by Nduwayo, in the government. Following the unending crisis, the opposition party threatened to pull out of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">American, Belgian and French soldiers are considering armed evacuation of their people, 900 of whom are said to be leaving Bujumbura every month. Their home countries had earlier cut off aid to Burundi following the no- intervention order of the former government. With dwindling revenue for the coffee-producing Central African country, pay for the civil service and the army has not been forthcoming. This has affected the morale of the army and made the war against the Hutu rebels a no-win situation. Burundi's problem lies in the ethnic imbalance in power sharing. Made up of 85 per cent Hutus and 15 per cent Tutsis, the country under Ntibantunganya, was ruled by a minority Tutsi government. It came to power following the 1993 Tutsi- organised coup in which Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu and Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated. This stirred massacres in which up to about 200,000 persons died. Today, Tutsi hard-liners run the army, the gendarmerie, the security service and the main Tutsi party, UPRONA. The Tutsis had always feared a change in the status quo which would lead to loss of power and wealth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the organisation of African Unity heads of state meeting in Cameroun, July 8, Salim Ahmed Salim OAU secretary-general, had called on the Burundian leadership to accept the Arusha peace agenda, which calls for power-sharing between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. He indicated that an African peace keeping force would be sent to restore peace in Burundi. Last week's coup, swiftly rejected by the United Nations, could make that a remote possibility.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are the right man for this job here,&quot; the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Wednesday, quoted Mandela as telling Malami.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is Nigeria's first high commissioner to Pretoria since the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries following the 1994 all-race elections that ended apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria is a leading African country that we would like it to take its rightful position,&quot; said Mandela. &quot;We can work together in rebuilding Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to the troubled diplomatic relations between Abuja and Pretoria over the November 1995 execution of nine Nigerian minority rights leaders, the South African leader said he hoped to work closely with Malami in solving some of the &quot;nagging differences&quot; between the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he would never forget the support Nigeria gave to the liberation movements in Africa and to South Africans in particular.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United States (PANA) - Nigeria's Olympic soccer victory is still reverberating in the American media, four days after the country's under-23 team beat Argentina 3-2 to clinch the gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article titled 'A Victory For The World To See,' the New York Times said Wednesday that Nigeria's gold medal, more than a simple victory for one country, had become the occasion for some chest-beating around Africa, &quot;even in neighboring countries that have long considered themselves Nigeria's rivals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now all over Africa, people are wildly celebrating an event that, more than any other, made the summer Olympics a resounding success for an often- beleaguered continent: the gold medal victory of Nigeria,&quot; the paper wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It quoted the president of the African Football Confederation, Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, as saying: &quot;those who are surprised by our progress will continue to be surprised, because those are people who refuse to see the progress Africa is making.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also quoted an Ivorian woman, Marie-Therese Apouteh, as saying that though Africa won a lot of medals (34 medals altogether to record its best games ever), &quot;none shines as brightly as the soccer players' gold. I still get goose bumps at the thought of it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The write-up is spiced with a photograph of four Nigerian players, their shirts pulled off, revelling after the victory in the match.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The article is a continuation of the unparalleled coverage given to Nigeria's &quot;Dream Team&quot; in Athens Daily News in a front-page story titled &quot; Cinderella Strikes Gold: Underdog Nigerians Turn Back Argentina. The Nigerian Eagles have landed -- On the Olympic Gold Medal Stand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The paper said &quot;Capping off a brilliant tournament performance in which they often came from behind to win, the Nigerian men's soccer team beat Argentina 3-2, scoring a goal moments before the end of regulation play.&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least six different photographs of the team, including a full-color front page photograph of skipper Nwankwo Kanu carried shoulder-high by two of his teammates on a victory lap, were splashed on the newspaper's pages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other photographs include that of a Nigerian soccer fan, clad in green 'Danshiki' (national dress) with white embroidery, doing a 'bata' dance -- a favorite of the American fans who thronged the stadium to support the so- called &quot;Cinderellas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In general, the soccer gold won by Nigeria may have helped to enhance the country's image, particularly in the U.S., but a scene at the Hartsfield airport in Atlanta on Monday was perhaps the most pleasurably stimulating since the victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On one of the busiest days at the airport, with thousands of people converging there on their way out of the Olympic city, an American boy wearing a white T-shirt emblazoned with the Nigerian flag and the words 'Atlanta' and 'Nigeria' was an indication of how much things have changed since the victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I got it at the soccer finals in Athens, where I supported the Nigerian team,&quot; the 10-year-old white American boy proudly told a PANA Correspondent at one end of the airport's concourse D, before continuing his long walk to the other end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The picture is a sharp departure from the situation some days earlier, when the Nigerian contingent was &quot;blacked out&quot; of the opening ceremonies by NBC TV, and Nigerian taxi drivers in Atlanta would rather introduce themselves as &quot; Africans&quot; rather than as Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A barrage of negative articles about Nigeria in the American media, as a result of its political situation and the involvement of a few Nigerians in various vices, had dented the country's image tremendously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under that situation, a T-shirt with the Nigerian colors on it may not go beyond the seller's shop.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, thanks to the exploits of the team referred to as &quot;Cinderella,&quot; the situation may have changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the day of the match, several fans -- Nigerians, Africans and Americans - - wore T-shirts with such inscriptions as &quot;the dream team goes for gold&quot; and &quot; I support Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And even on the day after the match, several people in Athens were still flying the Nigerian flag on their cars while some decked their shops with it.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government-owned Times of Zambia newspaper reported Wednesday that the three were arrested Sunday night after a tip-off.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The suspects are said to have led security officers to various houses within the town and retrieved blankets and clothing. They are reported to have confessed to the police that they mainly targeted corpses buried in coffins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The syndicate used to send one emissary to patrol cemeteries everyday for &quot; body-viewing&quot; along with genuine mourners to determine possible targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police were also reported to have recovered more than 26 pairs of underwear allegedly stolen from the coffins which the suspects said were for their personal use, because nobody would be interested to buy used underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A young lady, identified as the wife of one of the suspects, was reported to have openly wept at the police station after learning, for the first time, of her husband's &quot;weird career.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She complained bitterly that the scandal now explained her mysterious dreams about ghosts and sharing a bed with a corpse every night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is difficult to believe this, but I now understand why I have had these strange dreams. At times I dream that I am sleeping with a dead person.&quot; she wailed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The consumption of tropical fruits and vegetables could go a long way to reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases including cancer and heart diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This view is contained in a document entitled &quot;Nutritional Benefits of Tropical Fruits&quot; circulated at an international consultation on tropical fruits, which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from July 15 to 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was called to promote, among other things, more transparent import procedures for tropical fruits, particularly tariffication and harmonization of sanitary and phytosanitary measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Studies in various parts of the world show that people who consume diets with plenty of plant foods - including tropical fruits - have lower risk of developing heart disease, in particular arteriosclerosis, cancer and other chronic diseases,&quot; says the document.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ample consumption of tropical fruits can also be an integral part of effective weight control programmes, it says. The nutritious fruits listed were avocado, durian, guava, lime, lychee, mango, mangosteen, papaya, passion fruit, pineapple, starfruit, apple and orange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These also provide useful amounts of dietary fibre which help to lower the levels of certain fats (or lipids) in the blood, adds the FAO document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consumption of some fruits, including tropical fruits and certain vegetables also decreases susceptibility to cancers, in particular those of the digestive and respiratory tracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dark green and orange fruits and vegetables, mangoes and papayas are particularly mentioned as good sources of vitamin A, known as carotenoid, whose low intake raises the risk of some cancers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vitamin A is also necessary for normal growth and skeletal development, the health of the skin, eyes and fighting infections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many tropical fruits are also good sources of potassium, whose daily intake may reduce the risk of hypertension and stroke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Stroke, a hemorrhage of important blood vessels in the brain, is a major cause of death among older adults world-wide. In industrial countries, stroke is usually third among causes of death behind heart diseases and cancer,&quot; FAO says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, tropical fruits are also important sources of vitamin C, which is known to prevent scurvy and also serves as an antioxidant both within the gut where it can enhance the absorption of dietary iron,&quot; and within the body's tissues where it may have a protective effect against a number of degenerative processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAO said that fruit and vegetable consumption was picking up in developed countries after declining in the 1950s. Their intake has particularly picked up in the United States thanks to a government-funded campaign to encourage consumers to eat at least five services of fruit or vegetables a day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the tropical countries, where a wide variety of fruit are available, consumption is based &quot;on taste and cultural dietary practices, coupled with availability and affordability of the fruit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One common problem in these countries however is that most of the fruits are seasonal. Due to their abundance during certain months of the year and lack of canning capacity, up to half the fruits available are normally left to waste.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for this reason that the international consultation in Kuala Lumpur discussed measures of easing procedures for the export and import of tropical fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to tough phytosanitary regulations imposed on canned fruits under the World Trade Organization (WTO), only Kenya and South Africa were listed as major exporters of canned pineapple between 1990 and 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the core documents presented at the consultation in Malaysia encouraged exporting countries, including those in Africa, &quot;to adapt to these changes and introduce appropriate mechanisms, including investment in new treatment plants.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If this is done, the thousands of tons of fruits which are wasted each year on the continent could enter the tropical fruit market, whose volume is expected to rise to 1.6 million tons by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa is playing an active role in a multi-million-dollar project aimed at reducing the incidence of malaria on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Republic's Medical Research Council (MRC) is co-ordinating the project, which is attempting to plot the geographic occurrence of malaria throughout the African continent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The co-ordinator of the project dubbed 'Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa (MARA)', Dr. Dave le Sueur, says documenting the geographical occurrence of the disease and its severity will make it easier to implement appropriate and cost-effective intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MARA will also concentrate on such issues as drug resistance, mosquito species and climate, he added. A team of five investigators would integrate the data into a geographical information system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MRC will maintain the project database, and ensure that the information is regularly updated and relevant. Maps will be made available on the Internet, and on a Worldwide Web site now being constructed. This means that people planning to travel anywhere in Africa will be able to access the Web site for information on necessary precautions to take when planning to visit malaria-infected areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Le Sueur says more than 300 million people are at risk in terms of contracting malaria, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. &quot;Last year was the worst in South Africa since the 1930s,&quot; he said, &quot;with over 20,000 cases and 124 deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe had more than 1.4 million cases by May this year, and more than 2, 000 deaths, despite active control efforts,&quot; Le Sueur added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (PANA) - In one corner, a trained medical doctor exchanges diagnostic notes with a black-robed traditional healer, clutching a cow-horn tobacco pouch stuffed with brown snuff, which he regularly sniffs up his sooty nostrils.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The next moment the healer takes off his crown of feathers head gear, sits down on a reed mat legs crossed, and goes into a trance, casting bones like dice on the bare floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an adjacent room, a faith healer recites a prayer, invoking the Holy Spirit to drive out demons. Outside, a long queue of desperate patients await their turn in the hope that their health problems will finally be solved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The above-scenario is replicated daily at a local clinic in Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, where a 15-year old experiment that combines traditional, medical and faith healing is underway, despite criticism and prejudice from the world of science and modern medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When we started out, we were not given a chance. Everybody thought we were a joke, cheats out to take advantage of people's desperation. But prejudice has since turned into confidence,&quot; says Barbara Sibanda, cofounder of the clinic, located right in the city center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The traditional medical clinic, which has since opened a maternity wing manned by both traditional and medical midwives and a rural outpost, recently celebrated its 15th anniversary as a model for Southern African countries in an era of complicated diseases that have even defied modern scientific research.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research shows that despite the advent of modern medicine a century ago, up to 80 percent of the people in Africa believe in the efficacy of traditional herbal treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The success of the clinic does not lie in the hundreds of patients seeking alternative treatment methods every month but also in the success rate that has been achieved so far,&quot; says Dr Theo-Ewart Harvey, a medical doctor who works closely with traditional healer, Dumezweni Sidambe, midwife Elita Mlilo and faith healer, Harriet Ndlovu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Records show that the number of patients at the Bulawayo clinic has risen from a mere 500 in 1981 to over 25,000 in 1995, some of them from surrounding rural areas, and neighboring Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sibanda says patients visit the clinic either out of faith in traditional medicine or as a last resort after the failure of modern practice. She adds that patients are given a choice between the three methods. In the event of one of them failing, the patient is given an option to try the next alternative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The doctor or traditional healer may also recommend the option most likely to succeed, which the patient is free to accept or reject.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This has given our patients a wider choice. Some kind of revolution in the health delivery system,&quot; says Sibanda, who adds that the bias over the years is increasingly tilting toward traditional herbal remedies for ailments like infertility, mental illness, epilepsy, asthma and sexually transmitted diseases resistant to anti-biotics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This clinic is particularly proud of the traditional remedies to infertility which has helped hundreds of women conceive after years of trying medical methods. Most of them prefer to give birth at our maternity wing which we opened for that purpose,&quot; says Sibanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Recognition for the clinic which previously experienced &quot;terrible prejudice&quot; was evident during the anniversary when Zimbabwe's health minister, Timothy Stamps, and representatives of traditional healers organizations from Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi and host country, Zimbabwe attended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At that anniversary, the secretary general of the international organisation of traditional and medical practitioners, Rodwell Zongo of Zambia, traced the history of traditional medicine and criticized scientific prejudice to a system that has been around since the beginning of time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditional medicine has proved beyond doubt that it is as good, if not better in some cases, than Western medicine. African governments should now seriously consider funding further research in African medicine for complicated diseases like AIDS,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president of the 40,000-strong Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association (ZINATHA), Gordon Chavunduka, says because of ignorance, modern medicine continues to deny that traditional practitioners have concluded a lot of basic research and that many of the herbs used are correct even when judged by scientists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says in the last 15 years, ZINATHA collected 125 samples of traditional medicines for sampling by the drug control laboratory in Harare, 119 of which proved safe and useful while the rest were useless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Modern scientists from universities and other research centers will not discover anything new in the field of traditional medicine,&quot; he says. What is required, he adds, is collaboration, not condemnation of efforts to improve the country's health delivery system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stamps, who has been severely criticized for his indifferent attitude to traditional medicine, had the last say when he called for more cooperation between the two sides. Observers see this call as an acknowledgment that traditional medicine is here to stay.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal (PANA) - The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday expressed concern at the sanctions imposed on Burundi by neighboring states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement to PANA in Dakar from its Rome headquarters, WFP said the sanctions were blocking emergency food supplies to the needy in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless key neighboring countries allow emergency supplies to enter, then the situation is likely to worsen,&quot; spokesman Trevor Rowe said. &quot;This will force WFP to find other, more costly alternatives to delivering food.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organization estimated there was currently a stockpile of one month's emergency food supplies in the country for some 300,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A key problem is that once transport operations are shut down, it requires a long time to restart them. Trucks and drivers must be found again and contracts renegotiated,&quot; the WFP said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seven neighboring states, at a summit last week in Arusha, Tanzania, imposed sanctions against Burundi to protest a military coup on July 25 by former leader Maj. Pierre Buyoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya says he would assuage the ethnic rivalry between his minority Tutsi and the majority Hutu ethnic groups which have claimed some 200,000 lives since 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the neighboring states rejected his argument saying it does not bode well for sustainable peace in the central African country. Uganda and neighboring Rwanda, which has the same ethnic profile as Burundi, have said they would not join the embargo against Bujumbura.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, WFP on Tuesday also protested the Kenyan government's banning of its King Air passenger flights from Kenya to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The move is expected to make it more difficult for WFP personnel and cargo to transit in and out of Burundi,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - A government probe panel exonerated Ibrahim Dasuki of alleged financial sins, paving the way for secret negotiations between the Abacha regime and the family of the deposed Sultan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the family of Ibrahim Dasuki, deposed Sultan of Sokoto, the decision to take the Sani Abacha government to court over Dasuki's continued detention was not a simple one. Conservative elements within the family had argued that the move would further anger the government. The argument was, however, roundly defeated by other family members who cited the various hostile acts of government against the family.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Family sources revealed that contrary to claims by Yakubu Muazu, the Sokoto State military administrator, Dasuki's accounts were indeed frozen following his deposition. The family was also said to be irked that Dasuki's family members, lawyers and personal physician, had been denied access to him after he was deposed on April 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to family sources, what finally proved a decisive factor was the revelation by a mutual friend of the Dasukis and the Abachas, that the head of state had &quot;feigned ignorance&quot; when he was requested to allow Dasuki family access to the ex-Sultan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the circumstance, the family reasoned that by going to court, it would help the government tidy up the mess in which it has found itself over the Dasuki affair. Once the decision was taken, Chimezie Ikeazor, a senior advocate, was contacted to file a suit on behalf of Dasuki, asking for N500 million for illegal detention. An early sign of victory came when Tajudeen Odunowo, justice of the Federal High Court Lagos, granted Dasuki leave to enforce his fundamental rights to the dignity of his person, personal liberty and freedom of movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the substantive application Dasuki asked the court to declare as illegal, null and void his continued detention in Zing or any other place by the Sokoto or Taraba State government or security agents acting for, and on behalf of the said governments for periods of over two and a half months without trial or be informed of the offense for which he is being detained.  He also asked for an order releasing him from detention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are strong indications that the governments wants the matter amicably resolved. Sources confirmed to Theweek that shortly after the application was filed by Ikeazor, government started to mount tremendous pressure on Dasuki's family to withdraw the suit. The government, according to sources, has reportedly argued that Dasuki - if he got to know of his family's line of action - would not support it, but that as a good Muslim, he would accept his predicament as the will of Allah. The family reportedly described the government's new point an insulting, resulting in the hardening, rather than the weakening of its resolve. The family, in effect, adopted the attitude that &quot;he who is down, has no fear of a fall.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The confidence of the family might have been informed by some favourable developments in the last few weeks. In a landmark decision, Mukiliu Ope-Agbe, chairman of Lagos zone of the Failed Banks Tribunal, had declared that it was illegal for the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation to have joined directors of debtor companies as parties in suits against debtor firms. The judge ruled that actions filed by NDIC could only indirectly affect the directors during the execution of the tribunal's judgment. Going by Ope Agbe's judgment, joining the directors of debtor companies as parties is contrary to section 290 of the Companies and Allied Matters Decree of 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The judgment removed a major plank on which Muazu, the Sokoto military administrator, had based the removal of Dasuki. Worse for the government, the Garba Gummie panel set up to audit the account of the Sokoto Emirate Council from 1988 to 1990, had exonerated Dasuki of any wrong doing while in office as Sultan. According to the report of the panel, the deposed Sultan had banked N2 million, part of foreign grants for the propagation of Islam, with the Bank of the North, Sokoto branch. The investigators found the record of expenditure of the foreign grants convincing enough. They also found that the deposed Sultan was using his personal resources to run the Emirate council, which is said to be bankrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The panel also discovered that as a result of Dasuki's foresight, the Emirate Council has acquired property in Abuja worth millions of naira and that the decision to acquire the property was approved by the Sokoto State government. Dasuki was also found to have divided his salary amongst Islamic teachers and Hajia Amina, wife of Ahmadu Bello, the late premier of the defunct Northern Region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vindication of Dasuki might have informed government's change of attitude towards him. Last week, top government officials surprised the family, when they presented them with passes to Zing. The family members were expected to visit Dasuki last Friday. It would be the first contact between Dasuki and members of his family since April when he was unceremoniously removed from office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek gathered that the government's gesture was aimed at cajoling the Dasuki family to withdraw the suit it filed against the government.  Government reportedly gave indications that if the suit was withdrawn, Dasuki would be released. By last Wednesday, the family appeared to have backpedalled from its position that government should first release Dasuki unconditionally, before the suit instituted June 11, could be withdrawn. On that day Ikeazor, counsel to Dasuki, informed Odunowo of his willingness to withdraw the suit following a change of heart by government, which, he revealed, recently allowed him access to his client. The move was not challenged by the defendants, paving the way for Odunowo to accordingly strike out the suit as requested by Ikeazor. Secret negotiations are continuing between both parties. If every thing goes well, Dasuki may end up being exiled to Yola, as he has requested.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The National Women's Lobby Group campaign fund project has only raised K500,000, an amount which falls far short of the needs of women candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Treasurer of the campaign fund project Ms. Honorine Muyoyeta announced that the money that has been raised so far is not enough to support most the women candidates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was speaking during a live debate on the challenges of women candidates in the presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms Muyoyeta whose project embarked on the fundraising campaign last month made a fresh appeal to the general public to donate for the women's cause.  She, however, did not mention the amount needed to support the women candidates who would be approved by the various political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at the function MMD representative Professor Nkandu Luo urged women candidates to identfy campaign issues in order to win support from the electorate. She said women should market themselves and show what they can offer from the grassroot levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof Luo also said women are the custodians of traditional values and hence have an advantage over the male candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She further urged women who are fighting to be part of the electoral process to be committed to their parties and show that they can work side by side with men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNIP representative, Mrs Mary Fulano said women should be given a chance to compete favourably with men because they are equals.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - An invitation of former president Kenneth Kaunda by the University of Zambia Political and Administrative Students' Association (UNZAPSA) to address students last evening was cancelled by the university administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But students did not take kindly to the cancellation and accused the government of trying to silence intellectual reasoning and debate at the University of Zambia (UNZA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel disappointed and betrayed by the move to abort the meeting because all we wanted was to have first hand information about the current political and economic situation from the voice of wisdom,&quot; final year law school student Robinson Malipenga said in an interview last night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And at UNZA's Great Road campus last night, UNIP and UNZAPASA officials pleaded with angry students not to resort to violence, as hundreds of them, chanting anti-MMD slogans marched to Kalundu where Kaunda addressed them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Kalundu, former president Kaunda told the students he was very &quot;hurt and disappointed that this has happened&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope it is not the beginning of autocracy at UNZA,&quot; former president Kaunda carped. &quot;Students at the highest institution of learning must be free to meet and discuss with anyone they want.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government's plans to hike the fuel levy are not justified as the current levels of revenue collected for the roads maintenance programme was sufficient to sustain the exercise, said Chartered Institute of Transport (CIT) national chairman, Henry Chipewo in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The K15 billion collected for the roads maintenance programme is quite sufficient but because of over pricing by the road contractors the funds seem to be little to sustain the exercise,&quot; Chipewo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipewo, however, called on the government and the National Roads Board to work towards standardising the pricing of road works and avoid overcharging by unscrupulous contractors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just how does one arrive at K200 million per kilometre, when he uses very little money for crushed stones and whatever he needs to rehabilitate the roads?&quot; Chipewo asked. &quot;The government should not just jump onto the innocent tax payers and impose huge levies on them after failing to control bad contractors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Works and supply deputy minister, Celestino Chibamba, recently said government was planning to hike the fuel levy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The increment will have ill effects on the people, buses and other fuel users will also increase their fares,&quot; Chipewo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Chipewo advised the government to halt the &quot;raiding&quot; of funds collected for the roads rehabilitation exercise if the programmes was to succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the director of budget at the finance ministry, Elesani Njobvu, denied that government has been sourcing revenue from the roads fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fuel levy is collected as part of excise duty and we only know the percentage of fuel levy after returns are submitted every after 10 days. So it is wrong to say that we are sourcing government revenue from the fuel levy, &quot;Njobvu said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Njovu, however, confirmed that about K400 million of fuel levy had not yet been paid to the Roads Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Roads Board chairman, Raymond Jhala, earlier accused Chipewo of &quot; playing to the gallery&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chipewo as chairman of CIT sits on the Roads Board and knows the facts fully. No money is being diverted,&quot;Jhala said. &quot;The levy is just not enough to cover the reconstruction work that needs to be done on the roads.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG (PANA) - President Nelson Mandela of South Africa has announced tough new measures to crack down on the disturbing crime rate in the country, giving the assurance that the public will see the impact of the new initiative within a matter of days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An average of 50 people are killed in violence and crime-related incidents in the country each day, making it one of the most dangerous places to live in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General crime levels in South Africa -- underlined this past week by the &quot; war&quot; between drug gangs and vigilante groups in Cape Town -- are causing increasing public and business concern.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, the South African Chamber of Business said that its monthly business confidence index had dropped to its lowest level in almost a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a media conference at his Cape Town official residence Thursday, Mandela said: &quot;The question of violence is one we are dealing with. I am in contact with the minister of safety and security as well as the minister of defense on the matter, and we are taking the necessary precautions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In a couple of days,&quot; he added, &quot;every body will see that the government is taking very strong measures to crack down on all forms of crime in the country, especially in the Western Cape and Johannesburg&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Referring to drug-trafficking in South Africa, Mandela said it was clear that the country was dealing with some very powerful syndicates which had links beyond its borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's a matter of common knowledge,&quot; he added, &quot;and that is why we have established a regional organization which includes all the members of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), who are dealing with questions of security generally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Johannesburg daily, 'The Citizen', reported Friday that the South African police force, backed by units of the national defense force, are poised for what could be the single most visible anti-crime offensive undertaken in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows urgent meetings earlier this week between safety and security minister, Sydney Mufamadi, and justice minister Dullah Omar, with defense minister Joe Modise promising full military backing for the planned exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Pretoria Thursday, former cabinet minister Pik Botha called on Mandela and other South African leaders to hold a national convention on crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa, he said, needed to prove to the world that it had the will to eradicate crime and make the country truly free and a justified target for foreign investment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">has developed a new sugarcane variety which matures faster than the existing types.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company's agronomist, Simon Kibet, said the new variety dubbed H35-198, is currently undergoing final tests and will soon be submitted to the Kobos sugar research station for authentication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After being tested at the Kibos sugar research station, the new sugarcane will be subjected to tests by all sugar factories in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking to journalists at the start of the 1996 Kisumu agricultural show, in western Kenya, Kibet said H35-198 is expected to mature in 17 months instead of 20.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agronomist said the crop, developed from sugar seed imported from Hawaii, will be self-stripping, adding that research has shown it was suitable and could do well in the Nyanza sugar belt's soil in western Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new variety will be submitted to the national co-ordination of varieties board for trials by other shareholders in the sugar industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kibet said at Mohoroni Sugar Company, H35-198 had been tried against the conventional breeds for germination, stock count and juice analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its juice quality compared favorably against conventional types such as Co 421 and Co617, which are currently widely planted in our estates in Mohoroni,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe (PANA) - No beds or matresses for the prospective students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Worse still, no desks or chairs and no laboratory facilities for the under- graduates. Just a few academics waiting to dispense higher education to the first crop of aspiring science education teachers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such was the gloomy scenario when Zimbabwe's latest institution of higher learning, Bindura University College of Science Education (BUCSE), in the provincial capital of Mashonaland central, opened doors of its empty buildings to the first intake of students in April 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The birth of the college follows the government's decision in 1995 to relocate the Zimbabwe-Cuba science teacher education programme to Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the United States economic blockade imposed on Cuba biting hard, living conditions for Zimbabwean students studying in the Carribean island had worsened due to reduced stipends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Fidel Castro government, as a show of solidarity with this southern African nation dating back to Zimbabwe's armed liberation struggle, had sponsored the programme since independence in 1980. But Cuba later indicated it could no longer sustain it because of the debilitating economic embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, some 600 students are still studying in Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Originally a government public service training centre offering courses in craftwork, domestic science and secretarial work, the Bindura college, 80 km north-east of Harare, has now been transformed into a university with an initial intake of 125 students, 10 of them female.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if logistical problems were not enough, the embryonic university has been granted a paltry one million U.S. dollars by the government, a far cry from the three million dollars actually needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;During the first week, students had to make do without furniture as most of the furniture and equipment had not yet been delivered,&quot; says James Chitauro, pro-vice chancellor of the college, which is affiliated to the University of Zimbabwe in Harare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the college has been promised three million dollars for recurrent expenditure but needs in excess of two million dollars to start constructing laboratories and other essential facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at the college study for a four-year bachelor of science with education degree, majoring in general science, biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Education, curriculum development, pedagogics and teaching practice are also taught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also envision expansion in other areas of science, including computer science, soil sciences and mining sciences,&quot; Chitauro says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All these projections of course depend on demand, resource base and capacity of the college to deliver the programme to prescribed standards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The college has capacity for an intake of 1,000 students when fully operational in about five years with the first graduation in the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The college has 15 staff members recruited locally and five Cuban nationals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitauro says staff recruitment was largely successful although there were a few hitches with some offers not being taken up. &quot;The last seven months had been devoted to recruitment of staff. We recruited five.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The college official is anxious that more experienced professors, associate professors, senior lecturers and lecturers teaching at the University of Zimbabwe should assist in the successful implementation of the Bindura programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One believes that given all the necessary support, growing pains will not be that much for the nascent university.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government is considering integrating the five per cent charged under the Import Declaration Form (IDF) into the customs tariff structure, reports Business Line, the ZACCI newsletter, of August 6.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IDF is a form required to be filled out and 5 per cent of the cost of whatever import declared must be paid to the state before the form is handed over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government plans to do this in 1997 when the customs tariff structure is modified to a two rate tariff structure only,&quot; read the business newsletter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government promised to eliminate the IDF by the end of last year but nothing has been done about the levy up to now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking in an interview in Lusaka yesterday, finance minister Ronald Penza said government will be raising revenue fairly by installing uniform rates of tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The IDF is a good way of raising revenue for the government. But we are just trying to make it easier and fair for everybody with the new tariffs,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZACCI reported that the government intends to integrate the IDF into one of the two tariff rates of 10 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 10 per cent band will cater for both raw materials and intermediate goods while the 25 per cent will be for finished goods only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The danger in the move is that imports of finished goods from the COMESA region, which currently attract duty at six to eight per cent, will have a debilitating effect on Zambian industry because they will be much cheaper than locally produced goods which have been manufactured using raw materials imported at 10 per cent duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZACCI has on numerous occasions raised concern at government's mode of policy restructuring, asking that government consult the private sector before jumping into decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of Stanbic Bank and member of ZACCI, David Phiri, on Tuesday urged Penza to the clarify government's policy to the people so as to avoid misunderstandings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If people knew what was going on and policies were made clearer then the business sector might have more confidence in the market,&quot; Phiri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the minister said the perceptions of politicians and the private sector were different. It was enough indication to the private sector that politicians were fully behind the structural economic reforms, Penza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZACCI suggests a five per cent levy on raw materials, 15 per cent for intermediate goods and 25 per cent for finished goods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mansa - The Zambia-Zaire border at Chembe-Mwenda crossing was temporarily closed on Thursday by Zairean soldiers following an alleged refusal by a Zambian driver to give money which they demanded on flimsy grounds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The temporary closure meant that most of the transporters from the Copperbelt could not be allowed through for many hours until around 17.00 hours when some transporters made donations towards the demands of the soldiers that was when the border was re-opened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the passengers who suffered the inconvenience was Mr. Peter Kasompe, a vice chairman of Mwaiseni branch of the MMD in Mansa Central Constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the driver who works for Katebe Katoto company was uncompromising with the solders who man the border gates, and argued with them volubly using one of the Zairean languages. This infuriated the soldiers as they thought he was an ex-Zairean soldier or simply a turn-coat out to destroy their lucrative source of easy income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mansa central constituency MMD acting chairman Paul Kalwa has appealed to the government to intervene in such sensitive issues and deal firmly with trouble markers,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a meeting of constituency and brach officials in Mikomfwa Hall yesterday, Defence Minister Benjamin Mwila, said that the two monitoring groups of Forum for Democratic Process (FODEP) and the Zambia Independent Monitoring Team (ZIMT) could not be relied upon because they were biased and partisan to the opposition parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwila said that the two groups in the country had lost direction and tended to side with the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He charged that FODEP and ZIMT were political parties masquarading as non governmental organisations when in fact they had different agendas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwila said that even the leaders of the two groups were 'fake Zambians' who had not interest at heart of this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that some opposition parties had continued to cry foul over the contracting of Nikuv to update the voters registers because they had registered in more polling stations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said they thought they would cheat the computers but they were fished out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwila, who is also member of parliament for Luanshya constituency said that they were crying over the shoulders of the international community when the MMD fought it out inside the country without anybody's help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the MMD only invited the international community at a later stage when it was asked to explain its policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mwila also said that the 'black mambas' have been firmly dealth with and the elections will go on peacefully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that despite Dr Kaunda's rantings that he would release some of the suspected leaders of the group, this could not be done because 'it was mere cheap propaganda.'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndola - Two prominent Zambian farmers today announced the formation of a political party whose platform will entirely rest on the agricultural plank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Agricultural Minister and Mpika Member of Parliament, Dr Guy Scott, joined President of the Zambia National Union of Farmers (ZNUF) Ben Kapita to announce formation of the new party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consequently Dr Scott has resigned from Movement for Multi-Party Democracy to form the National Lima Party (NPL) and Mr Kapita is equally expected to resign from the farmers union.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new party, dubbed the great one by its founders, is not interested in the presidency but wil contest this year's elections and seek representation of farmers in parliament. The party was registered with the Registrar of Societies on August 9 but names of other founding committee members were not given during the brief chaired by both Dr Scott and Mr Kapita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement by the two helmsmen of the new party who will be co-chairmen until a convention is held said NLP wanted duly elected farmers representatives to be in the house to provide balance and oblige the executive to take interest of the rural sector more seriously than they have done in the past. The statement read by Dr Scott said whatever the differences of approach by the former UNIP government and MMD, a single striking miner is of more political significance than 1000 desperate village farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is basically this bias away from the villages that has resulted in our former federal partners Zimbabwe and Malawi outstripping us in agricultural production many times over,&quot; the statement added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NLP aims to correct the state of affairs in parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the NLP may also decide to support candidates who belong to other parties but have independent thoughts and a bias towards farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said the new party wanted to usher in the concept of political representation based on economic interest groups rather than idealogy, tribe or narrow individual interest in the Zambian democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier Mr Kapita who said he would relinquish his post in the farmers union observed that Zambia was one of the few countries with surplus arable land but every year asked for food aid from nations which are even smaller in size because it has not utilized its potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For 32 years we have talked about agricultural potential but we have not created wealth from this,&quot; he said. He noted that out of 60 million hectares of arable land in Zambia, only nine million is being utilized and the problem was that the representatives in parliament did not understand agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should be serious about putting agriculture in its right place.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Bwalya was reacting to a submission by principal state advocate Abdul Aziz Kinariwara in the case where the Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) is challenging the constitutionality of the recent Constitution of Zambia amendments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinariwara was trying to justify that the preamble in the declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation offered checks and balances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The preamble was not put in the body of the Constitution because it was aimed at demonstrating the policy of the law,&quot; Kinariwara said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kinariwara argued that the Constitution had retained more than 80 per cent of what was contained in the 1991 constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those parts that have been repealed in the 1991 constitution have been recovered in Article 79 which gives Parliamenabsolute powers to repeal.  therefore Parliament acted within its powers in making the amendments. I would like to say the Parliament has powers to change the basic structure of the Constitution,&quot; Kinariwara argued. &quot;It is wrong to say that a new Constitution has been made as a result of the 1996 amendment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC lawyers contended that the preamble had changed the basic structure of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZDC lawyer Robert Simeza in reply said the amendment that was made was ultravires because the Parliament has no legislative competence in the manner that they did.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want the court to declare the Constitution ultravires of article 79.  While we admit that the Parliament has powers to make alterations to the Constitution, they cannot be made at any time and there are limitations,&quot; Simeza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on the citizenship clause in reply Simeza said the restriction that demand that a presidential candidate must have both his parents as citizens of Zambia by birth or descent was an alteration or contravention of the law that says no law shall make any law that is discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The clause discriminates against certain individuals when the constitution says that should not happen,&quot; Simeza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another ZDC lawyer John Sangwa also said Parliament has powers to amend and alter but the powers are not absolute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The powers are not absolute and they are limited. As long as it does not touch on the basic structure of the constitution,&quot; Sangwa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bwalya set judgment for August 28.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - National Party leader FW de Klerk is credited with being something of a magician among politicians, capable of producing a rabbit from a hat. The analogy was particularly apt at the opening of his party's federal congress in Cape Town at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wreathed in artificial smoke woven with multi-coloured beams of light, he mounted a gleaming white podium to stand, flanked by gigantic video screens which projected his image into the far corners of the city's cavernous Good Hope Centre, and unveil his anti-poverty programme, the NP's alternative to the Reconstruction and Development Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk's carefully timed entry, led by blue- and red-skirted drum majorettes in a welter of shapely legs, spinning maces and twirling South African and party flags, was accompanied by thundering music of epic proportions -- the high point of a programme that had seen a troupe of Coons strutting with guitars and trumpets, an all-black choir sing Shosholoza and a rendition of When the Saints Come Marching In by a 15-piece band.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrival of De Klerk, hand in hand with his wife, Marike (who the day before had been re-elected, unopposed, as head of the NP's Women's Action), brought the crowd of several thousand to its feet. Many had travelled to the centre from their Cape Flats homes in the buses parked outside the building: their numbers must have been reassuring to the leader of a party trying to shed its segregationist past and present itself as a non-racial &quot;Opposition with a Mission&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;FW de Klerk we love you,&quot; chanted a group of middle-aged women. The show surpassed anything they could have seen on TV that night, and they were dazzled by it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Party is our party,&quot; they shouted in agreement when De Klerk accused the African National Congress of losing its grip, of failing to create jobs and act against crime, of not being able to rein in its allies the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the South African Communist Party and of pushing the RDP on to the backburner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact is that the RDP is floundering,&quot; he said. &quot;The ANC lured millions of voters into voting for them on the basis of the RDP. And now that they are in power, they are failing to manage it as a comprehensive and cohesive anti- poverty action plan.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Surprise, surprise! The NP had decided to address the issue with a new initiative -- &quot;an alternative, comprehensive, meaningful and workable anti- poverty strategy&quot;. Experts would help draw up a basic framework. There would be an extended process of consultation at grassroots level within the party -- and simultaneously, &quot;intensive consultations within other forums and community-based organisations and non-governmental organisations&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was no hint of irony as De Klerk spelled out a plan to engage and encourage the kind of grassroots mobilisation and organisation his party, as the government, had spent so much energy trying to destroy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He offered little by way of substance: this would come when the NP convened, within about nine months, a National Anti-Poverty Conference to plan the way forward and properly design the vehicle to achieve the party's vision of &quot;a new and mighty political movement based on shared, Christian values and beliefs which would shatter old ethnic and racial patterns and &quot;redefine the political map of South Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Spurned by political parties in his bid to rally a coalition of opposition forces, De Klerk and NP pundits will be focusing on more receptive, middle- level leadership and through it, people on the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a growing urgency at the grass-roots level of all political parties about the need for politicians to rise above old divides and to co- operate in a strategy to stop the rot in our beautiful country,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To the strains of We are riding the rainbow, De Klerk stood flanked by his party executive and officials. As he left the hall amid a welter of drum- majorettes and flags, the crowd made a rush for the aisles to get close: &quot;Ons vader (our father),&quot; screamed one woman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the slick opening razzmatazz, reality set in over the subsequent two days as delegates pondered discussion documents and broke up into groups to consider such burning issues as whether or not the party should change its name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was in these forums that it became clear the party has its work cut out for it -- for how will it bind disillusioned ANC and floating voters into a new non-racial dream if it is still blighted by the nightmare of racism?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Inside the party there are some racists -- there are people who think they are better than others,&quot; said a Western Cape delegate. His comment was couched as an observation about the party's lack of organisers at grassroots level in the townships -- but its thrust was the racism still felt by new party members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We haven't got proper people to organise. If we say we are going to start an anti-poverty campaign all the different groups and different languages should be used.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changing the party's name got an overwhelming thumbs down. &quot;It's not necessary for the NP to change its name -- we should change our attitudes to one another,&quot; said another delegate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of capacity at grassroots level to effect mass mobilisation, the need to organise &quot;our own structures to operate behind enemy lines&quot; (this from a former ANC branch chairperson), lack of reportbacks to ordinary members and the invisibility of NP leaders in the communities the party wants to win over were the dominant concerns expressed from the floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was also some resentment that sacrifices by party members who risked limb and property organising for the NP were not properly appreciated, that there was insufficient support for those experiencing intimidation. For them, a name change would translate as an admission of defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk was swift to address these issues in his closing speech, paying special tribute to the &quot;guts and courage&quot; of those for whom being an NP leader meant real physical danger. Nor would the party change its name as a mere &quot;PR exercise&quot;. However, when the day dawned that NP numbers were augmented &quot;by a wave of new support moving away from the ANC and some other parties ... (a name change) will be on the agenda and then we'll decide ...  with proper consultation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, he urged the party faithful to &quot;market and sell the NP, increase its outlets&quot;. They should &quot;reach out, interact ... sit down and convince the customer and close the political deal&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was inspirational. De Klerk sounded less like a politician than a motivational speaker at a Dale Carnegie crash course, setting the 2004 general elections as the target for take-over and 1999 as the bridgehead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country could do with a powerful, credible opposition. But it will take more than smoke and laser shows to develop one.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the pressure mounts for political change in Swaziland, King Mswati III has announced a 29-person constitutional committee to draw up a new constitution for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting of the nation on July 26 (a public event which anyone may attend) held at the Ludzidzini Cattle Byre, Swaziland's traditional capital, the king also announced the appointment of Sibusiso Dlamini as prime minister.  Dlamini is a former finance minister and executive director of the International Monetary Fund.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointments come three months after the king promised concrete democratic changes at a previous meeting of the nation on May 8, at which he fired former prime minister Prince Mbilini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delay between the May 8 announcement and the appointments drew criticism from the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU), the opposition People's United Democratic Movement (Pudemo) and the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The constitutional committee will travel the country, soliciting views on what the constitution should include. It will then draw up the final document which will be adopted at another meeting of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With a budget of almost R2-million, the committee has not yet been given a time limit, and although it was appointed two weeks ago, has not yet met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee's members have been drawn from a diverse spectrum. While conservative members, including four chiefs, have been appointed, it also has significant liberal representation. The SFTU's Themba Msibi, Mario Masuko, a member of Pudemo and Dr Jerry Gule of the Institute for Democracy and Leadership (Ideal), are some of the more liberal appointees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SFTU, Pudemo and Ideal earlier this year formed a coalition, the Swaziland Democratic Alliance, to try to force change in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since their members' appointment, these groups have held a string of meetings to decide whether or not they should co-operate with the committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They have been stalling because a 1973 decree, which bans political activity, has not been lifted, and because it is not yet clear whether their members have been appointed as individuals or representatives of their organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weekend, the SFTU called a mass meeting where it resolved that the appointees would take part in the process, provided that 18 demands were met.  These demands included the immediate repeal of the 1973 decree, a guarantee that chiefs do not harass their followers for holding dissenting political views and access to all media (Swaziland's radio, television service and Swazi Observer newspaper are state-owned).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been fewer reservations from those who are wary of the constitutional committee about Dlamini, who has had considerable international experience during his time in the IMF -- even the Democratic Alliance is pleased with the appointment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mohammed Farah Aideed, the Somali warlord who humiliated the United States in 1993, died last week in clan fighting. Mark Huband witnessed his bloody career first-hand</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HE was usually grinning, broadly enough to expose a sparkling gold tooth at the back of his mouth. It sparkled almost as brightly as the massive diamond perched on the gold ring he wore on his finger. With his finger, he tapped the carved silver head of his elaborate wooden cane. The cane helped him to walk, because he limped slightly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He lived in a wilderness, although his collection of high-quality, tasteful shirts always remained neatly ironed with sharp creases along the sleeves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The nomads would trot past along the soft sand of the track through Bardera, where I first met Mohammed Farah Aideed in August 1992. Bardera was naturally desolate, because it had never known much fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was here Aideed, a man with a hunger for total power, plotted and prayed and plotted some more, in the wilderness, a long way from the house where he died from bullet wounds last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had retreated to Bardera, in Somalia's southern region, in 1992. At that meeting he was polite, unrepentant and as cold as steel. He lived by the gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A year later, as the United States dragged the rest of the world across what has become known as the &quot;Mogadishu Line&quot; -- beyond which peace-keeping becomes war, faction leaders become &quot;criminals,&quot; and civilian homes become &quot; command and control centres&quot; -- Aideed was still grinning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His country had been laid to waste, but he had grown rich. His supporters had stolen from the relief agencies through extortion, charges, rents, armed robbery and bribery. That was Aideed: the master thief. He smiled. He was stooped like an elder statesman. Then the bombing started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are going to smack them as they need to be smacked,&quot; an American official said, as Aideed went into hiding and Mogadishu became the most dangerous place in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After Aideed's men killed and mutilated 23 Pakistani United Nations troops on June 5 1993, Washington decided to kill the man who had got in the way of its blueprint for Somalia's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The drone of an aircraft engine rumbled through the city's warm night air.  Precision bombing left a hole in the table where Aideed had sat hours before.  But he had vanished into hiding, leaving behind his toothpaste, after-shave and deodorant in the house where I last saw him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For weeks, Cobra helicopters buzzed like mosquitoes over the Mogadishu rooftops, searching for the renegade. Then, on an evening bathed in orange light, the muezzin called the faithful to prayer and the noise was somehow different.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By October 3 1993, Aideed had been on the run for several weeks, sleeping in three different places every night, never being seen in public, not risking interviews, barely travelling during the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On October 4, a woman grabbed my hand and led me through shacks to where the wreckage of a Cobra had become a playground for scores of children who swung from its rotor blades. The million-dollar &quot;bird&quot; had been brought down by a modified rocket-propelled grenade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The woman led me back on to the street. It was early morning, and it was hot. Thousands of people yelled, screamed, chanted and spat out their hatred of the outside world. A boy dragged a bloodied, dismembered corpse along the sandy street to a crossroads. A man towed a piece of corrugated iron on the end of a piece of rope. He displayed it in front of me, loosened a knot. The folded iron sprang open. The large, white body of a man wearing only his khaki military underpants, rolled within the twisted iron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;American! American!&quot; The screech was deafening. Here was the enemy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighteen Americans and 300 Somalis had been killed when US Rangers were sent to a hotel where one of the UN's notoriously unreliable and highly paid informers had said Aideed was holding court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All American military decisions were made at the US supreme command in Washington. Somewhere, a world away, behind a desk in a government building where, nearby, workers were waiting for the Metro, picking up their morning newspapers or sipping the first coffee of the day, a decision was made to &quot; snatch&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Aideed was not there. The bird had flown as the elite Rangers, who returned my waves from the rooftop as they sat in their helicopters, legs dangling from open doors, buzzed across the Mogadishu night to death in the sand. It was territory that Aideed's gunmen would die for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Photographs of the American bodies went around the world. One photographer won a Pulitzer. Aideed had won. That night he was free. The search was called off. The UN's Wild West-style &quot;wanted&quot; posters with his image disappeared from the walls. The streets throbbed with victory, fear, revenge, violence and blood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chief architect of the disastrous operation to kill Aideed with the most hi-tech weapons in the American military's armoury, Admiral Jonathan Howe, looked paler and more pathetic than ever. Despite being the United Nations' special representative in Somalia, he led the Americans in a condemnation of the world body for blunders that were entirely US mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now Aideed is dead. His bloody victory that October of 1993 was Africa's defeat. When Rwanda lurched into genocide six months later, the world closed its eyes, covered its ears and shut its mouth. Rwanda's rivers ran with blood, but the world fled. The Mogadishu line was not about to be crossed again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aideed's son Hussein (35), a former US marine, was elected on Sunday to succeed him. Hussein Aideed said after his election that he would follow his father's policies in the clan wars ravaging Somalia, and that he would &quot; eliminate all internal and external enemies.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - One Free State, one Lekota?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'One Free State!&quot; yells Councillor Bazooka Ma-baso, working the crowd for Comrade Terror.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One Lekota!&quot; the overflowing classroomful of Mangaung residents yells back, on cue. The chant, first heard in Welkom a week or so ago, is moving like tumbleweed across the Free State's plains as the leadership battle grows between Terror Lekota and the &quot;big five&quot; -- the African National Congress's senior officials in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One premier!&quot; &quot;One Lekota!&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There's something moving in the fervour, one could even say anger, with which it is uttered -- and something a little alarming in the cultishness.  The event, meant to be a support rally for the premier masquerading as the launch of a new ANC branch, actually has the feeling of a revival meeting, an outpouring of emotion that says more about those doing the praising than the person being praised. It is as if these people -- workers, drunks, housewives; comrades festooned, almost nostalgically, with paraphernalia collected during the glorious days of April 1994; at least two imitations of Winnie's inauguration hat; children outside with noses pressed against the windows; Sunday bests and old woollen jerseys side by side -- need to reclaim not just their hero but their dreams (which he carries) from the defilements of these past few weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And there, behind the bunting, a face unfolds, out of beleaguered anxiety, into its legendary smile. The front tooth might have been fixed, there might be the extra weight of power around the jowls, but there's still something unquestionably folksy about this face; the open countenance of the liberation movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terror takes the mike and he's home. For 40 minutes he keeps the crowd with him, as he skilfully weaves, into a standard stump about the neccessity of structures, an impassioned call for them to become involved in the movement so that they can know for themselves the truth and not be deceived. He will not forsake them, he says, in his rasping, compelling seSotho, and they cheer.  This is the Terror of the 1980s: they don't come with more charisma.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in the Mercedes. Back to reality. The cellphone rings. He is late for a meeting. The face folds in upon itself again; the nose wrinkles, the brow creases. He is under immense stress: distracted, impulsive, exhausted, inexplicably intense one moment and switched off the next. Terror Lekota will deny it to his last breath but, only months after the devastation of his eldest daughter's suspected suicide, he is fighting for his political life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We zoom up to Free State House, his grand residence on the hill. Back in &quot; the big room&quot;, as his family calls it -- still filled with the Boere-kitsch of yore (antelope heads; copper engravings; a poor copy, in beige and baby blue, of the ho'kultuur one would find at ex-Groote Schuur and Libertas) -- loyalists from the &quot;allied structures&quot; await him. The unions, the civics, the women's movements: together they will strategise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations against him are that he reshuffled his Cabinet without the requisite consultation; that he is using a corruption charge to dispose of a political foe; that he has ignored an agreement made with both the national ANC structures and the provincial general council of the party to turn the corruption allegations over to an independent inquiry. These allegations, which concern malpractice in the provincial Department of Economic Affairs and Tourism, have resulted in the demotion of Lekota's arch-rival, Ace Magashule, from the Cabinet portfolio of Economic Affairs and Tourism to that of Public Transport, and in the demotion of Tate Makgoe from Finance to Environment and Tourism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result of the row is that ANC leaders in the region, which failed to elect Lekota as provincial chair in 1994, have now dropped him from their highest organ in the province, the Provincial Working Committee. They seem determined to get rid of him. Lekota disputes the allegations against him strenuously. He has handed over the evidence of corruption to the attorney general and auditor general, he says: what is that if not an independent inquiry?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paging through his diary, he demonstrates the fact that he did indeed &quot; consult&quot; extensively before exercising his prerogative to reshuffle. He had done this, he claims, because he believed Magashule was &quot;better suited&quot; to the on-the-ground work of Public Transport, and because &quot;I had begun to hear rumours about misconduct, and I felt that if people were querying a certain individual, it's better to move that person, to calm things down&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the evidence of misconduct grew, &quot;it began to take shape in my mind that the whole thing has nothing to do with the fact that I do or don't consult.  It has to do with the fact that, with the changes in Cabinet I effected, these things (the imputed corruption) were going to be picked up.&quot; The attack on him, he believes, is thus &quot;a smokescreen, a cover-up thing&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under Steve Tshwete, the ANC's National Working Committee has been called in to mediate, but has not clearly backed Lekota. &quot;The problem,&quot; says one senior ANC official who was a colleague of Lekota's in the United Democratic Front, &quot;is that Terror has confused the Constitution with convention.  According to the Constitution, he has acted correctly. But according to convention, he's off. He didn't bring the important players along with him.&quot; For this reason, some of Lekota's greatest allies are finding it difficult to support him against his foes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magashule agrees &quot;the Constitution specifies that the premier has the power to appoint his Cabinet. But we're putting it in the context of ANC culture and tradition, and we're saying there's no individual above an organisation.  You don't want to build a cult of one individual. It is the ANC who rules this province, as a collective. Not one man.&quot; It is, of course, impossible to govern by collective -- and so this dispute puts the Free State's troubles at the heart of one of the ANC's central dilemmas now that it is in government: accountability versus efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota's record in the province has been good. With the limited resources available to a provincial leader, he has governed well: it is hard to find a count against him as an administrator. No one --perhaps not even Nelson Mandela himself -- bears more responsibility, in this country, for popularising non-racialism: after his switch to the ANC in jail in the late 1970s -- a switch which led many of his generation of black consciousness leaders to follow -- Lekota made it his mission, upon release in 1982, to advocate non-racialism. This is a legacy he has maintained by effecting, brilliantly, a reconciliatory process within the Free State. He has utterly disarmed the right wing in that province with his bluff, gravelly charm -- even as he has torn down their statue of Verwoerd from outside the provincial headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he clearly has not managed to bring his own party leadership along with him, even if he does have popular support. The problem goes back to his appointment, as candidate for premier, before the 1994 elections. Magashule had been expecting the premiership and had come first on both northern and southern Free State ballots: Lekota, in fact, only came 35th. But the ANC decided that Magashule wasn't senior enough, and that the Free State needed some buttressing: rather than selecting Lekota for the national Cabinet, an arena many feel he would have excelled in, the movement deployed him to govern his home province -- a region he had not really lived in since his childhood, and in which he had no substantial political base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rather than trying to smooth this difficult situation into a workable compromise, Lekota fell right into already existing tensions between the northern Goldfields (from which Magashule and his supporters come) and the south, around Bloemfontein. &quot;Terror is the straightest man I know,&quot; says someone who worked with him in the UDF, &quot;he's not sly. He's not an operator.  He has a list of things to get through and he does it. The niceties of politics were always left to others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was brilliant, for example, as Popo Molefe's deputy on the ANC election commission in 1994 -- but he put many people's backs up in the process: &quot;He has a tendency to be dictatorial,&quot; one insider says. &quot;So, too, does Mandela.  But Mandela gets away with it.&quot; Perhaps this explains why, as Free State premier, he has been a good administrator even as he has had a difficult time politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his long-standing partnership with Molefe, he has always been the aggressive mass-mobiliser to Molefe's quieter intellectualism. He thinks on his feet and says what he thinks. Using precisely those skills, he is now mobilising the province to his side. He never attacks his opponents directly in his speeches, but before he talks, a Bazooka Mabaso will shout: &quot;Phantsi, iOpportunisti, Phantsi!&quot; And everyone will know exactly who he means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Terror Lekota is en route, from Bloemfontein, to address a mass meeting in the north. On the way, he makes an unscheduled stop at the farm on which he was born, in the Senekal district. We visit the one-roomed farm school both he and his mother attended. It is built of solid sandstone blocks; 1919 is inscribed on the lintel. Inside, it is dank, derelict and littered, but still in use. &quot;Barnes and Dugard!&quot; he cries, picking up the very grammar textbook he probably read out of in the early 1950s. He is distressed that the floor has collapsed: next week, when he comes here on his birthday to sleep over and to address the school, he will bring concrete with him and lay a new floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then on to the grave of his grandfather -- a peasant who lived for 56 uninterrupted years on the farm and who raised Lekota. The old man died last year; Lekota built him a fancy tombstone, and buried him on the ancestral plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now he notices that there is cowdung all over the graves, and that cattle have been scratching against the tombstones. Local farmworkers tell him the man who rents the property, a right-winger, moved the beasts from a neighbouring farm on to the plot specifically to trample the Lekota grave. He screws his face up, but makes no mention of the desecration until I ask about it in the car.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My grandfather,&quot; he replies, &quot;once told me that you must learn to refuse to complain, because one day, if you make a habit of it, you may walk past the house of your neighbour, and if his dog barks at you, you may go down on all fours and bark back. When people come out to investigate the din, they'll not be able to tell the difference between dog and human being ... The only way to deal with this is to build a proper fence so that it can't happen again, and to go on with life as if nothing happened.&quot; He pauses. &quot;And to buy the farm so my ancestors can live in peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the timeless silence of a deadened winter highveld, a convoy of cars, led by a Mercedes carrying the most important man in this land, bumps by on a rutted road. For the first time in 36 hours, I sense a calmness in Terror Lekota, despite -- or perhaps because of -- what he has just seen. In the midst of his crisis, it has been difficult for him to talk; perhaps this visit to his roots has been his way of telling me about himself without having to. The past -- golden, crisp and dry in the afternoon light -- animates and excites him; perhaps even recharges him for the battles that await him once we're back on the cellphone network. This is where he comes from. This is why he fights.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Casino king Sol Kerzner is no stranger to controversy -- but it is no foregone conclusion he will face charges over the R2-million &quot;lobola&quot; he admitted to have had a hand in paying to secure exclusive gambling rights in the homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Kerzner denies he ever &quot;expected or accepted favours&quot; as a result of &quot; contributions to social, charitable and political groups&quot;, allegations that he has often done just that have followed closely in the wake of the success story that saw him build a multi-billion rand empire from scratch in two decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only last month the prestigious United States Wall Street Journal suggested in a front-page article the head of the National Indian Gaming Commission had unduly approved Kerzner's R1,2-billion Mohegan Sun casino resort venture with Mohegan tribe members in Connecticut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon after, Britain's Sunday Business published an &quot;exclusive&quot; which claimed Kerzner had offered about R40-million to John Major's Tory party for their election war chest -- which would have been the biggest donation ever to the party -- in exchange for British citizenship. Both Kerzner and the Conservative Party hotly denied the story.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mauritius, where Kerzner has extensive hotel interests, bribery allegations have led to the resignation of a cabinet minister, while similar claims have been made in connection with his mega-resort development in the Bahamas, started in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the biggest albatross around Kerzner's neck remains the Transkei bribery scandal, now a decade old. It has been suggested as one reason Kerzner decided to make his permanent home abroad and, until it is resolved, is likely to brand him wherever he seeks new business opportunities. Recent British and South African experience has also shown that Kerzner has remained an embarrassment to real or imputed political friends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transkei Attorney General Christo Nel, who at times has waged a virtually single-handed campaign to have the allegations of the bribe to then Transkei prime minister George Matanzima tested in court, told the Mail &amp; Guardian he still believed there was a prima facie case against Kerzner, but said his work-load would allow him to revisit the case probably only by the end of September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said South African authorities refused to extradite Kerzner before the reunification of the homeland, and that the loss of his previous investigators and the non-availability of witnesses -- one important witness has since died -- may complicate matters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nel said he approached Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi early last year for a South African detective to re-open the investigation. That April, Captain Andre Heunis of the Port Elizabeth police Commercial Crime Unit was made available to him. Heunis completed the new docket a fortnight ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heunis this week said it was not a cut-and-dried case as Kerzner, who had been &quot;co-operative&quot;, argued the payment to Matanzima, through Cape attorney David Bloomberg, had been an extortion he had to go along with to protect his legitimate business interests, rather than a bribe to secure new rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Sun International Transkei affiliate Transun had been involved in final negotiations in 1986 to buy Transgames, represented by Bloomberg, for what it believed would give it exclusive gaming rights to the entire Transkei.  &quot;Then Matanzima came at the beginning of December and made certain demands, wanting to buy a farm and wanting R2-million. He threatened to take the gaming rights they thought they had away and give them to a family member.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In early 1988 Kerzner told the Alexander inquiry in Transkei he was aware of rumours Matanzima had wanted R2-million for the gambling rights, but denied he had paid it &quot;because it is not my style of negotiating&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a year later he admitted to the Harms Commission in South Africa the money had been paid, saying: &quot;The circumstances under which the payment was exacted by Chief George amounted to at least commercial extortion on the part of the then corrupt regime in the Transkei.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, questions remain about Kerzner's extensive casino developments in Bophuthatswana, which include Sun City and the Lost City. Sun International Bophuthatswana also had exclusive casino rights in that former homeland. Huge tax breaks -- R1,2-billion has been mentioned as the figure for the Lost City -- and management contracts with one or more foreign- registered Kerzner companies appear to have paved the way for Kerzner to amass his sizeable fortune abroad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Should political parties make public details of who gives them money, and how much? Does the public have a right to know who's paying what and to whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These vexed questions have sprung to the fore with Bantu Holomisa's allegations that hotel magnate Sol Kerzner bought favours by contributing to African National Congress election coffers and assisting party luminaries such as Thabo Mbeki and Steve Tshwete.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While lawyers acting for Mbeki and Tshwete have issued Holomisa with a warning to stop making such allegations, saying they are untrue, the fact remains that without public disclosure doubts will remain in the minds of citizens -- alongside the prevailing perception that those who govern are likely to be corrupt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue is likely to be hotly debated when MPs and senators consider the new code of conduct for MPs which is to be tabled in Parliament next week.  The code requires individual MPs and senators to declare outside interests.  But opposition politicians this week pointed out that there is little point in forcing individual disclosure when political parties -- particularly the ruling party -- could receive huge donations in secret, which could result in public policy being influenced.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the code was being drawn up by parties represented on the ethics committee chaired by Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, the Democratic Party pushed strongly for disclosure of party funding to form part of it. &quot;In a highly authoritarian caucus system, it is highly relevant who is funding a party,&quot; said DP MP James Selfe. &quot;It boils down to trade-offs, what one does in return -- and whether it causes you, in the last resort, to do something you might not ordinarily have done.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All the parties agreed that the ethics committee would look at the issue of making public party contributions once the code for individual members had been dealt with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian asked the seven parties represented in Parliament whether they support public disclosure of party funding and, if so, whether they would provide us with details of contributions for the 1994 general election campaign:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African National Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has not come out clearly on whether or not it supports public disclosure of party funding and will not make public details of contributions. &quot;We draw your attention to the long-standing practice of the ANC not to make public its financial records, nor details of funders who have made contributions to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The financial records of the ANC are regularly audited, and subjected to the procedures and checks required by the ANC constitution. The ANC sees no reason to deviate from that practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any discussion on whether to legally compel political parties to make public their financial records and details of donors would need to take place among the country's public representatives in Parliament -- and should be premised on a desire to safeguard the integrity and transparency of public institutions,&quot; a statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is not prepared at this stage to state whether or not it supports public disclosure -- and will not divulge details of money it has received from companies, individuals and other donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is premature to debate the issue before clarity is reached with regard to state funding of political parties -- as is the case in many other democracies. This debate will start soon, as already agreed between the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The National Party regards the relationship between a donor and a party as an honorary arrangement and therefore we do not comment on matters of this nature. If, however, a donor wants to publicise such donations it is the donor's privilege,&quot; said the NP's managing director, Kobus de Plessis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inkatha Freedom Party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Totally opposed to public disclosure of party funding and not prepared to make any information available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When people make donations to the party it's a private arrangement,&quot; said IFP MP Walter Felgate. &quot;The IFP has no such history of favours being bought and won't be drawn into disclosure because a Holomisa hoo-hah is going on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is in favour of disclosure of all foreign funding and will disclose this -- but will not disclose local funding until such time as legislation is in place requiring all parties to disclose. Would support such legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;About 80% of our 1994 campaign funding was from the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), which is a matter of public record. The remaining 20% was from private and corporate donors and was given on a confidential basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not prepared to disclose who those donors were but can give an absolute undertaking that not one had strings attached. It is self-evident the DP is unable to quash prosecutions in return for donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People who donate to us believe in us and think we've a useful role to fulfill --they don't think we're in a position to get them contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The DP is in favour of all foreign funding being disclosed by all parties and we'd like to see legislation in this regard. The issue of local funding is more ticklish. In South Africa one has a new government with one party with an overwhelming majority. We don't want to be put in a situation where people are reluctant to donate to the DP for fear of disclosure and incurring the displeasure of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On the other hand, if there was new legislation requiring open disclosure of all future funding then the DP would support it,&quot; said the DP's national chairperson of finance, MP Douglas Gibson</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African Christian Democratic Party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Believes it is in the public interest that all political parties make full disclosure concerning individuals, organisations, companies and other concerns that have contributed to their campaigns -- and is prepared to give details of its own funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is important to have not only a Code of Conduct for MPs, but also to have one for political parties, in order to ensure that the general principles which underpin public life are respected and maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is very difficult to stamp out corruption, if a strict Code of Conduct is applied only to persons holding public positions, while the funding of political parties remain undeclared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Has had two funders since its launch: it received R3-million from the IEC to run its 1994 election campaign and many small donations from born-again Christians in particular. &quot;We received no international funding nor any corporate funding, because the big companies were only interested in the major political players,&quot; said deputy president Louis Green MP. After the 1994 elections, the ACDP received R365 049.39 from the Dutch government through the Nederlandse Sticktung voor Nieuwe Zuid-Afrika to assist with the local government elections campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have sent a copy of your fax to John Schroeder, our national treasurer, in Pietermaritzburg, to fax to you a list of persons who made small contributions to the party (in most cases no more than R1 000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freedom Front</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In favour of public disclosure and prepared to give details of its own funding, but wanted to clear this with individual donors first.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are a new party which only came into being in 1994 and as such has no financial history. We began with nothing,&quot; said financial manager Dr Willie Botha</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Like all the other parties standing in the election we received money from the IEC -- about R5,7-million. We got R250 000 from one company and donations from supporters, candidates and party workers. No-one from the corporate sector helped us except one company which we think gave money to all the parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also got money from the Dutch foundation, like the other parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pan Africanist Congress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strongly supports public disclosure and would give details of money it received for the 1994 election campaign if it had a financial report for that period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Looking at party political funding is the second part of the ethics committee's mandate,&quot; said PAC MP Patricia de Lille. &quot;The PAC has always believed in openness and transparency. All funding, foreign and local, should be disclosed or else you lose the value of disclosure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We know the DP gets funds from big business inside the country -- hence it is prepared to compromise on openness. Parties should have to declare so there's no conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got money from the IEC which helped us. We do have problems though -- there is no financial statement for the period February 1994 to February 1995.  A commission established at our recent congress is still working on it. It is right that these things are debated vigorously. We must deal with the public perception that we are all on a gravy train and paid a lot to do nothing. We must show that we stand by the concepts of accountability, transparency and democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Paul Ekon, the businessman who hosted Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's 50th birthday party -- and who Bantu Holomisa claims was merely a go- between for casino magnate Sol Kerzner -- has a chequered past and a list of friends reading like a who's who of Johannesburg's glitterati.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axed deputy minister Holomisa dumped the ANC in what could be one of its most damaging corruption crises last week when he claimed Kerzner -- seeking help in quashing his pending Transkei corruption trial -- had bankrolled the ANC's 1994 election campaign to the tune of R2-million, had given free hotel accommodation to Sports Minister Steve Tshwete, and had paid for Mbeki's 1992 birthday bash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC immediately denied all charges, saying a &quot;private businessman&quot; had paid for Mbeki's party and that Tshwete's 1994 stay to attend a boxing bout at Sun City had been funded by boxing promoter Rodney Berman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Berman soon denied he had paid, while there were strong indications from government this week that the R2-million funding could well be admitted to.  Holomisa this week maintained he had &quot;privileged information&quot; that Mbeki's party, which was held at Ekon's home in Johannesburg's stately Houghton suburb, was contributed to by Kerzner and that Ekon had been a &quot;middleman&quot; for Kerzner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon, a 36-year-old former beau of Anneline Kriel and entrepreneur who is alleged to have left the country in haste last year because he had been implicated in a criminal investigation by the police Gold and Diamond Branch, told the M&amp;G this week Kerzner attended the party, but claimed he did not fund it. &quot;Sol, Holomisa and Thabo are all good buddies of mine ... But it had nothing to do with Sol whatsoever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon claimed the costs had been shared by himself, clothing industrialist Charles Priebatsch and tailor-entrepreneur Yusuf Surtee -- contributing R1 000 or R2 000 each. Drinks had been &quot;sponsored&quot;, he said, but did not name a source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, an acquaintance this week said Ekon had personally told him in 1993 that he had made his house available at Kerzner's request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Priebatsch and Surtee are friends of President Nelson Mandela. Surtee, who has also had contact with Kerzner, has long been known as the &quot;ANC tailor&quot; , supplying leaders of the organisation including Mandela with top of the range clothing from his Sandton boutique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priebatsch, who hosted Mandela when Michael Jackson visited him on his birthday last month, this week said: &quot;Yusuf Surtee has been a friend of Mandela for many years. That is how I became a friend of the Mandela family.  I am close friends with his (Mandela's) daughters, and with Madiba.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priebatsch also said he, Ekon and Surtee had sponsored the Mbeki bash. &quot;It was round about R1 000 a person. All I remember was that the office (the ANC's Department of International Affairs, which Mbeki headed at the time) asked us to give the surprise party for him. That was all there was. There was really no Sol in it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was &quot;not a major party&quot; and claimed there were &quot;a lot less&quot; than the reported 200 revellers. A newspaper report at the time claimed party- goers were treated to a &quot;lavish buffet for 200 guests&quot; including ANC leaders Cyril Ramaphosa, Joe Slovo, Ronnie Kasrils, Gertrude Shope and Aziz Pahad, political luminaries Helen Suzman and Wimpie de Klerk, and &quot;top businessmen&quot; including Kerzner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priebatsch said he had a letter of thanks from the ANC for giving the party, but that he would release it only if Mbeki wanted it, and not to the media. &quot; I don't want to attract that kind of publicity. I also don't think it is ethical.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg-reared Ekon, who is of Greek extraction, first joined the fast set of the city when he inherited a large amount, said to be about R3-million, from his mother about 10 years ago. Friends say he lost much on betting and high-living. In the early 1990s he met Anneline Kriel, Kerzner's former wife, through born-again Christian meetings he held at his house, and they dated until she left him for husband-to-be Philip Tucker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He ran a restaurant, the Hot Tin Roof, in the rich Johannesburg suburb of Rosebank at the time, and marketed Kriel's perfume range through his cosmetics outlet, Accent, in nearby Hyde Park. Both businesses folded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those he liked to count among his friends and acquaintances included (later convicted fraudster) Greg Blank, Kerzner, Dali Tambo, at least one of the Mandela daughters, Surtee, Priebatsch, Clive Beck (son of millionaire Graham Beck) and members of the horse-racing fraternity. Among his political contacts he counted Mbeki, Holomisa, Winnie Mandela and Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad. Said one of his acquaintances: &quot;He's a very sweet guy, quite flamboyant and very wealthy ... He was a rich kid who didn't really understand politics. He was very well-meaning, and then he discovered the ANC.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ekon's other business interests appear from company records to have included investments, trading, horses, furniture, and gemstones. The latter field, an acquaintance said, brought him in contact with intelligence agent Eugene Reilly -- who died under mysterious circumstances after he allegedly warned of Chris Hani's impending assassination -- and at odds with former Civil Co-operation Bureau operative Ferdi Barnard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, acquaintances say, he &quot;suddenly&quot; left South Africa for Britain amid speculation he was the subject of a police investigation into forex irregularities involving precious metals or gems. Ekon denied the forex allegations were the reason he left, saying a business opportunity had attracted him. He said he returned last October and was given assurances by a police Gold and Diamond Branch colonel he was not under investigation. The Mail &amp; Guardian has reason to believe this is not true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerzner, meanwhile, toned down his original statement on the Holomisa claims. He was reported on Sunday to have said: &quot;I find Holomisa's allegations so outrageously false that they are not worthy of comment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a day later, while denying the Mbeki or Tshwete sponsorships, he left open the possibility he had funded the ANC when he said in a statement: &quot;All contributions I make to social, charitable and political groups are for causes in which I believe and I have never expected or accepted favours as a result.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ravan was bought by the South African subsidiary of British-based Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1994 when dwindling foreign aid put it in jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But poor sales over the past six months prompted the decision by Hodder to absorb some staff and close Ravan's offices. Ravan general manager Monica Seeber said the holding company was committed to honouring contracts to publish future works.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Rwandan government is monitoring two war criminals who are living in South Africa, and it believes there could be more lurking among the many Rwandan refugees in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the absence of an extradition treaty between South Africa and Rwanda could allow the suspected killers to remain in this country indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rwandan ambassador to South Africa Eliphaz Karenzi said this week the two men were responsible for &quot;scores of deaths&quot; while they abused their positions in the former military regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan government is waiting for the South African government to enact an extradition treaty with Rwanda so the war criminals can be shipped to Kigali. Karenzi said the South Africans had initially suggested a treaty and Rwanda had eagerly agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, a foreign affairs representative told the Mail &amp; Guardian the government had no plans for a new treaty. An extension of a 1911 treaty with Belgium still exists, but has doubtful legal status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karenzi said his government had gathered evidence of the war criminals' deeds from the families of the murdered victims. He declined to divulge details of the two men, but said his government knew where they were living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are living a normal life. At an opportune moment we will call on the South African government to ensure these people are brought to justice.&quot; He added that the South African Police had so far co-operated with his government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karenzi said Zambia was the first African country to arrest Rwandans responsible for the slaughter in the central African state. Four men collared there were sent before Judge Richard Goldstone at the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the war criminals are living in Zaire and Kenya, which cut off diplomatic relations with Kigali a month ago in the wake of Rwanda's insistence that the criminals be returned. Many of the leading killers are now based in Nairobi, where they are &quot;enjoying themselves&quot;, Karenzi said. &quot;It is only a matter of time ... The United Nations tribunal is likely to put pressure on Kenya to (hand over) ... these criminals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A lawyer specialising in international affairs said if the tribunal decided to investigate these men, South Africa could be obliged to co-operate in terms of international law. However, if the Rwandan government wants them, an extradition treaty will be essential. The tribunal is generally handling the &quot; big fish&quot; and the Rwandan government is tracking the rest, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Back in Rwanda, Karenzi added, the prisons are overflowing with the many thousands of war criminals picked up so far. Apart from its efforts to bring back refugees from Burundi and Zaire, the government is concentrating on preparing to rebuild Rwanda with the help of $2-billion in pledged aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karenzi said a number of South African companies have expressed interest in helping with the country's reconstruction. One South African construction company is already involved in rebuilding the country's roads, while a consortium of health care companies hastaken over management of a major hospital.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The attorney general's office in Pretoria is seeking the extradition from the United Kingdom of a Briton charged with murdering two black men at a neo-Nazi training camp near Heidelberg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tyrone Chadwick, who jumped bail last year and is believed to be living in the UK, was expected to stand trial later this month. The case will be postponed until extradition has been completed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been alleged that Chadwick ran a training camp for the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), training members of Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party to carry out raids on African National Congress supporters.  Evidence of paramilitary training facilities were discovered on the property.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chadwick (37), from Lichfield, in the English county of Staffordshire, was granted bail of R25 000 in March last year after the decomposed bodies of two black men were found in a shallow grave on a farm near Heidelberg, south of Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although his British passport was handed to police as part of the bail conditions, police believe Chadwick managed to skip the country by posing as a tourist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johanni Barnardt, an advocate in the attorney general's office, said steps were being taken with the co-operation of the British police to locate and arrest him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alleged AWB member Marthinus Venter, jointly charged with the same murders, was also granted bail of R5 000. Both men have denied the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chadwick, who describes himself as a &quot;commercial soldier&quot;, is understood to have claimed that he is a member of the &quot;third force&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The unidentified black men, shot at point-blank range, were members of the IFP. Police say Chadwick claimed to have trained IFP members as hit-squad assassins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the bodies was said to have been that of a teenager who had been killed for firing too few rounds during a raid. Inkatha has denied any involvement in training at the farm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the training camp was closed in December 1993, Chadwick claimed that he provided black volunteers and white mercenaries camouflaged in black make- up for attacks arranged by a fanatical right-wing associate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chadwick is said to have sent his Inkatha charges out on raiding parties to &quot;ANC settlements&quot; with instructions to come back with a prisoner.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Free State premier Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota has exposed abuse of almost R6-million of public money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Mail &amp; Guardian investigation has found that some of the money was allegedly spent by senior members of the provincial administration on unauthorised overseas trips, staff loans, a loan to the liquor board, pub lunches and compact discs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Lekota's supporters -- furious at the failure of the African National Congress to come out in support of the premier in the face of recent speculation that he was about to be fired -- claim the party's national leadership is attempting to cover up the corruption scandal to protect the party from embarrassment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The allegations are contained in a report drafted by the director general of the Free State government Dr DB Setai which was handed to the attorney general's office, claiming former MEC for economics and tourism Ace Magashule illegally established two section 21 companies -- and deposited government funds totalling R5 784 000 in their accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The companies were called the Free State Promotion Agency and the Free State Tourism Company.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report says: &quot;The executive committee was informed about the existence of the agency on July 3 and July 9 1996. Banking accounts had been opened and funds had been withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no need for section 21 companies. It seems the only reason for establishment of the companies was to bypass cumbersome financial, procurement and personnel provisions of the public administration and to avoid control measures. The registrations of the companies were therefore terminated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A cabinet committee of the Free State was approached by the Department of Economic Affairs and Tourism on April 29 to obtain approval for the establishment of a section 21 company. The proposal was vetoed as the committee felt such work fell within the ambit of their department. The treasury board was also approached and turned down the request.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, accounts in the name of the Free State Promotion Agency were opened on March 22 with a deposit of R5-million. R784 000 was deposited in a separate account for the Free State Tourism Company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Setai's report claims funds were used to purchase furniture, pay consultants and for overseas trips. People were employed and due to start work on July 1 and August 1. The Free State government was advised by lawyers it was not obliged to keep these people in employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His investigation into the two companies runs into hundreds of pages, detailing alleged infringements of treasury regulations, tender procedures and staffing contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accounts had been opened at banks that did not tender for government business, expensive equipment was purchased from companies that neither tendered for the contracts nor had existing contracts with the Free State government. And neither Section 21 company had boards of directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Free State Promotion Agency was launched to &quot;promote increased direct foreign investment in the province, set up joint ventures, offer advisory services to business which relocated and establish a database for monitoring and assessing exports in the Free State&quot;, according to founding documents discovered by Setai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was to have employed a staff of 15. An undated inter-office memorandum attached to Setai's report was sent from Magashule to his director complaining about the manner in which staff recruitment was conducted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You are directed to re-advertise in the Sowetan and Sunday Times and give 10 days for people to apply,&quot; Magashule wrote. &quot;An impression has been created that persons have been earmarked for these positions. I find this totally unacceptable.&quot; A massive R225 810 was spent on advertising the posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staffers in the department went on three overseas trips to Amsterdam, Germany and China financed from the funds in the account. There was no approval for the trips from the director general's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The apparent justification for setting up the Section 21 companies is contained in the report. The Free State Tourism Company was established supposedly to correct the Free State's apartheid legacy. &quot;There is no marketing sinegy (sic), no database, borders have changed in the province, shebeens, taverns and taxis are not included in tourism marketing and Bophuthatswana and QwaQwa have since been incorporated into the province,&quot; its founding documents read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">R784 000 was deposited in an account for the company and when the account was frozen on July 6, there was R184 711 remaining. Money spent included several allocations for staff loans, pub lunches, CDs purchased by staffers and a loan made to the Free State Liquor Board.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report has now been sent from the attorney general of the Free State to the regional commissioner of the SAPS and the commercial branch has been instructed to investigate the charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile supporters of Lekota rallied to protect him from the ANC national structure's &quot;meddling&quot; in provincial affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources in the Free State government say the political row in the province has been engineered to shift the focus away from a police investigation into fraud allegedly committed by Magashule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In June, Lekota dismissed Magashule from his position as MEC for economic affairs and tourism. At the time, he cited &quot;insubordination&quot; as his reason, but sources in the Free State said Lekota had already begun to suspect Magashule was allegedly involved in corruption. Lekota declined to comment on this issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lekota's supporters say although he did not make Setai's investigation public, they had no doubt that his dismissal of Magashule from the provincial government was in the interests of &quot;good governance&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say he did inform ANC national executive committee members Steve Tshwete and Joe Nhlanhla of the alleged corruption when they were sent to the Free State last month to investigate the row.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC wanted to handle it internally, to keep it quiet. But the government of the Free State has to follow the rules and leave the matter in the hands of the attorney general and SAPS. At every step of the way, formal and proper procedures were followed,&quot; said a member of the provincial legislature who did not want to be named.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Magashule seems to have some political clout with ANC head office, though.  Terror has been forced to reinstate him and Magashule managed to get a hearing with the ANC leadership outside of Tshwete's formal visit to the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the meetings Tshwete had with the provincial executive committee everything was sorted out. Terror was told he could exercise his prerogative to arrange the ministries as he saw fit, with the proviso that he appoint an advisory committee to assist him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But two weeks ago, everything fell apart again when we heard Magashule and some of his supporters had met (ANC deputy general secretary) Cheryl Carolus and Tshwete without Terror being informed,&quot; the source said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the organisation was satisfied that the Free State's &quot;political problems&quot; were in the process of being settled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He denied that Carolus had met Magashule to plot Lekota's removal and said ANC headquarters was committed to solving the Free State's problems with a view to building unity in the province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ANC's national leadership acted responsibly with regard to that problem,&quot; Mamoepa said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the ANC's leadership was informed of the allegations of corruption, Mamoepa said the organisation would not countenance corruption from any quarter and that the &quot;due process of the law&quot; should take its course with any member found to be involved in corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Magashule's office was repeatedly approached for comment this week, but no reaction was available by the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The poor state of the rand is a reminder of the strength of incoming competition. Foreign competition's marketing budgets are more powerful as they are backed by a much stronger dollar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marketing budgets for global brands targeting the South African market have arguably increased by about 25% in recent months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strength of incoming competition is demonstrated by multimillion rand marketing investments from P&amp;G and Samsung over the past few years. It is therefore difficult to out-spend competitors with dollars and yen in their pockets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The smart alternative is to out-think them. And the best rand-hedge is innovation and creative thinking, which makes the burning question of South African marketing all the more crucial: Where have all the visionaries gone?  Without them we will never be able to outsmart our competitors whose pockets are bulging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Skip back a generation and the movers and shakers of South African business were far-sighted marketers -- like Anton Rupert and Albert Wessels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But today's marketing drives are not innovative, except for a few. The local companies which still appear to be market-driven and have a brand vision are Nandos and BMW. Nashua has a &quot;what if&quot; philosophy that keeps it permanently innovative and Standards Bank's Accolades programme shows a refreshing willingness to break new ground in a normally conservative market segment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But these exceptions do not detract from the local industry's long-standing norms of &quot;borrowing ideas&quot; from abroad. South Africa's period of national introspection lasted 30 years and you can't remain an inward-looking loner for three decades without becoming disoriented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During this period of isolation, many companies looked overseas only to borrow ideas. The lack of real competition at home meant concepts could be cloned without adaption to the South African market (sometimes down to the brand name -- for example, Toys R Us).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Priorities were short term and nailed to the bottomline. After all, if the future was grim to non-existent, why bother?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this environment, marketing degenerated into brand accounting. It was a short-term function -- primarily selling! Indifference to long-term brand health was encouraged by worrying job mobility in marketing departments nationwide. On-the-job experience entrenched bad habits. Job-hoppers changed places with business as usual functionaries who often had one eye on the current quarter and the other on their retirement date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's education system produced marketing entrants who had been conditioned during 12 years of schooling and three years of university to accept the status quo and not ask irritating questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Problems intensified in the Eighties as many of those who still asked questions got tired of waiting for answers and emigrated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those left behind found themselves holding the line -- watching posts and avoiding risks. Marketing departments in some companies became almost a backwater. The best and brightest were doing financial sums or working on corporate downsizing to reduce costs or installing new computer systems to increase efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A risk-averse corporate culture seeped into the marketing function and has yet to seep out. Early adoption of affirmative action might have introduced new blood and new ideas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, progress has been tardy. A catastrophe is in the making, especially for companies which hold market leadership by default because real competition is lacking. The Americans are coming, the Europeans and the tigers from the Pacific Rim. As South Africa re-enters a global economy, local companies will find themselves facing aggressive marketers who invest heavily in their brands and refuse to play by yesterday's rules.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are closer to new media and technology trends. They are not hobbled by past misconceptions and smug assumptions. If they have direct knowledge of a market, they invest in research, and in the local people who have the knowledge and skills to give them an edge. Strangely, similar investments are avoided by those holding the local marketing turf. Leaders by default are vulnerable. And not only from foreign competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local rivals sitting at numbers two, three and four in a market segment are just as worried by foreign competition as it means even leaner pickings, and opportunists, entrepreneurs and risk-takers may well decide on a pre-emptive strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, there is hope for marketers determined to compete and hold local leadership. Those who wish to kick the habits of the past can do so, even major corporations. It usually requires a culture shift and a team approach. &quot; Intrapreneurship&quot; needs to be fostered by encouraging internal executives to think more like entrepreneurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brand executives need to be freed from obsession with daily brand management and encouraged to dream of future directions. In the process, in a small way, they become brand visionaries. Given a little success and a lot of corporate encouragement, they become true brand visionaries -- capable of seeing the big picture and dominating it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alliances are advisable with partners who possess the skills necessary to formulate the innovative plans and surprise tactics needed in pursuit of the overall vision. Courage is needed to because innovators will be challenging the inertia and accepted wisdom of a whole generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If you imitate, you stay an also-ran. Visionaries prefer to lead the way.  Some have started already. The likes of Edgars, Standard Bank, BMW, Nandos and Nashua have shown that marketing drive keeps you ahead of the competition, not under it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimate test, however, is to develop a world brand. Already South African Airways, Outspan, Harveytile and a few others operate in a global marketplace. The challenge for a generation of visionaries is how to join them. Nandos and Conservation Corporation Africa have recently made the break into world markets and that's promising since it shows that we still have local movers and shakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Or does that exception prove the rule that in general we're inward looking and myopic -- visionaries who after 30 years are overdue for an eye-test?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Felicia Mabuza-Suttle show, regarded by black audiences as the &quot;African version of Oprah Winfrey&quot;, has failed to attract advertising despite its popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although one of the most successful SABC local television talk shows, the programme has not received much advertising support because media planners from large advertising agencies dislike Mabuza-Suttle and are unimpressed with her show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As one media planner put it: &quot;My client feels that Felicia is far too much of a racist and on principle, they won't let me put ads on her show&quot;, while another said: &quot;Listen, the Felicia show would be my last ditch.&quot; A third has this to say: &quot;Most of the time you get the feeling she is not really listening, she is too busy promoting Felicia.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research conducted for the South African Broadcasting Corporation by an independent researcher, Insight Market Research Consultants, has shown that South Africa's leading advertising agencies are reluctant to sell advertising around Mabuza-Suttle as they regard the show as &quot;high risk&quot; despite its good ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The objective of the research, which was conducted among media planners, was to evaluate whether personal viewing habits influenced the choice of media purchasing. Although media planners vehemently deny that their personal feelings are involved, it seems their attitudes toward Mabuza-Suttle and her show play a significant role in the lack of advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It really depends on how you feel about her as to whether you will support her show,&quot; said one ad agent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report stipulates that respondents who disliked Felicia and/or her show became &quot;almost self-righteous, punitive or even vicious in their attitude towards and descriptions of both Felicia and her show&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research not only assessed the reaction of media planners to Mabuza- Suttle on a personal level, but also monitored any racial bias that influenced their reactions to the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The research was conducted among top South African advertising agencies including Lindsay Smithers FCB, Lintas, Hunt Lascaris TBWA, McCann Erickson and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Rightford, Searle-Tripp &amp; Makin, among others. The advertisers were told that the research was in a bid to obtain guidelines on how best to market certain programmes and to gauge the advertising sector's attitude towards the show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the spontaneous responses to the Mabuza-Suttle show from advertising agents included: &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;rude&quot;, &quot;talk, talk, talk&quot;, &quot; aggressive&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, &quot;self-indulgent&quot;, &quot;arrogant&quot;, &quot;super-ego&quot;, &quot;acts too white&quot;, &quot;too American&quot; and &quot;unsubtle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Positive responses included: &quot;New South Africa&quot;, &quot;lively&quot;, &quot;good interviewer&quot;, and &quot;dynamic and controversial&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SABC television analyst Don Seokane says ratings for the show are fairly high, fluctuating between seven Audience Ratings (about 700 000 viewers) and nine ARs (about one million viewers). SABC has a total audience of about five million viewers, Seokane says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talk shows and current affairs programmes are regarded as &quot;topical&quot; shows, often avoided by potential clients interested in purchasing advertising time, the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Audiences of controversial shows often fluctuate depending on the issue being debated and/or discussed, argued media planners. They said there was a hesitancy displayed by clients to buy advertising time around these shows as viewership is erratic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I know clients feel more comfortable buying something that is more predictable,&quot; one media planner said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A comment expressed by a media planner was that one could &quot;see by her (Mabuza-Suttle) body language that she is not really even listening to her audience&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Criticism of Mabuza-Suttle did not stop at her alleged insincerity, but extended to her dress, with media planners complaining that her &quot;glittering clothes&quot; accompanied with a &quot;know-it-all&quot; attitude did not bode well for her or the show and did not encourage them to sell advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report found that advertisers deemed the show &quot;too political&quot; and sometimes &quot;very pro-black&quot; and &quot;even anti-white&quot;, with panel and audience mix limited to &quot;token whites&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only white faces you see in the audience are those she invited,&quot; said another media planner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The general feeling among advertisers was that Mabuza-Suttle allowed her own personal beliefs to dominate the show and that she often led the debate in favour of her opinion in an &quot;abrasive and rude&quot; presenting style. &quot;She cuts people off and is self-indulgent. If the discussion doesn't go the way she wants it to go, she</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">will change it,&quot; one planner said. &quot;She is always right, absolutely!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The performance of the show in terms of its AR ratings was not impressive enough for advertisers who felt it was &quot;not a good buy&quot;. Advertisers say the show is not an option because it is overpriced and no one is quite sure who the target market is. The audience profile, however, is considered to be the &quot; more educated black elite'', but advertisers say this &quot;limited market&quot; can be reached via programmes that have some crossover and a broader white and black audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Overall reaction to the Mabuza-Suttle show, outside of advertisers, are mixed, with only a few viewers regarding it as a good show. The majority of white people believed the show is &quot;not acceptable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Black, coloured and Indian viewers enjoy the show with a large majority of black viewers regarding her as a role model. Some black respondents, however, felt Mabuza-Suttle should be &quot;more black&quot;, with some advocating an earlier time slot and subtitles or dubbed broadcasts. While black audiences are quite happy with the Mabuza-Suttle package, white audiences want a lighter, more entertaining show, such as the Oprah Winfrey programme where the presenter does not take herself so seriously and always attempts to find the lighter side to serious issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabuza-Suttle suffered harsh criticism at the hands of viewers who had some of the same gripes as advertisers. Viewers said while the show was supposed to be &quot;for the people, Felicia made sure that the entire show was on her&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Viewers, black and white, also said Mabuza-Suttle &quot;talked too much during the show&quot; and &quot;bombarded&quot; viewers with her opinions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The stage is set for powerful foreign interests to play an increasingly dominant role in the domestic air travel industry -- first came South African Airways' (SAA) link-up with Lufthansa, then the Comair-British Airways (BA) franchise deal, and now it is the Virgin Airlines and Sun Air talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin Airlines' South African representative Caroline Ravenall confirmed that talks between British entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Airways and Sun Air are under way to hammer out a deal with the domestic carrier ahead of Virgin's maiden flight from London to Johannesburg on October 2.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">An equity deal between the two has not been ruled out &quot;at this stage&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Bert van der Linden, commercial director of Comair, the 50-year- old local private airline, announced a multi-million rand upgrading programme to launch a business-class service next month. This face-lift will tie up with the launch of Comair's franchise agreement with the global giant BA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We shall be repainting our aircraft and signage as well as changing our crew's uniforms and aircraft livery to those of BA.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the Comair/BA franchise agreement, Comair will be able to use BA's worldwide booking and sales facilities, including the BA Executive Club -- highly rated as one of the best frequent-flyer incentive systems in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thebe Investments' joint venture with SAA -- SA Express together with Inter-Air, the independently owned carrier, are two of the other notable regional airlines on the domestic market. Both have also recently reported bold expansion plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA representative Leon Els described the forays of foreign players in the local market as part of an ongoing global trend similar to the &quot;strong alliance&quot; agreement SAA entered into with the German Airline Lufthansa last September.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - All electricity users will ultimately pay for the more than R1,3-billion apartheid rent boycott power bills at some point, says Kevin Morgan, legal adviser to the electricity regulator, following the agreements reached by Eskom and debt-ridden local authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Eskom, being a state-owned enterprise, can only write off the debts against income from what all other electricity users are paying,&quot; says Morgan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Non-payment would retard the electrification programme, he says, since less money would become available to extend electricity to those who do not have it. In addition, prices are 2% higher than necessary to compensate for the non-payment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Morgan commended Eskom for having devised a method that can ensure prompt payment. At the time of going to press, Springs City Council was expected to pass a resolution accepting Eskom's plan to normalise payment.  This follows a deal between the electricity body and the North East Rand Metropolitan Council (NERMC), which could see the utility write off more than R800-million in unpaid power bills if other local authorities follow suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope the agreement will help other local authorities that are also seeking a way out of a very tricky situation,&quot; said Thom Peters, acting chief executive of the NERMC, which includes Kempton Park and Tembisa, after the deal was signed with Eskom senior general manager for sales and customer services Joe Matsau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been talking to local authorities about ways to resolve the non- payment issue since before 1990, so it is particularly pleasing to see such a protracted discussion reach a productive end,&quot; said Matsau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">East Rand sales and customer services manager Laetitia van Staden added that the accumulated debts will be written off after 70 months unless any of the local authorities that signed the latest rounds of debt repayment agreements with Eskom default for any reason.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If at the end of 70 months the local authority in question has performed satisfactorily, then the balance of the debt can be overlooked,' said van Staden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom is owed more than R1,3-billion by several local authorities and individual consumers. The largest debtors are in Gauteng. The NERMC (which includes Kempton Park) owes about R290-million, largely related to Tembisa township. Springs City Council owes R150-million, mainly related to Kwa-Thema township.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main elements of the terms of the NERMC/Eskom deal are:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Full monthly payments for the next 70 months; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* NERMC to repay about R55-million of its accumulated debt in instalments with interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In return, Eskom has agreed to &quot;write-back&quot; the balance of their debt of R247-million to the end of the 70-month repayment period. Eskom will also withdraw the court action order to seize some of the assets of Kempton Park in return for the debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eskom has since taken over the ownership of the electricity infrastructure of several other townships which owe it over R500-million. These include, among others, Soweto, Katlehong and Lekoa townships. In areas such as Vosloorus, Eskom has agreed to hold the debt in a suspense account while leasing the assets to supply the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When asked if Eskom would be seen as having different policies for the same problem, Van Staden said in the long run the solution will finally be the same for all areas after the restructuring of the electricity supply industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The sharp reversal in the business confidence index for July came as no surprise, says Dr Ben van Rensburg, chief economist of the South African Chamber of Business (Sacob), which compiles the monthly measure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Inflation, interest rates and the exchange rate climate were all wrong -- and we see little chance of improvement in the short term,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, according to Dr Ernie van der Merwe, economics chief at the Reserve Bank, the dent to confidence will not necessarily affect the growth outlook for this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is normal at this stage in the economic cycle for business indicators to show some diversity. We are reaching the top of the cycle and the indices reflect that,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At 116,6, the index stands at its lowest since September last year -- although this is still higher than a year ago -- and marks a reversal of 2,3 percentage points on June's recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reasons given for the setback in July include the weaker rand, increased industrial action, uncertainty over interest rates and the medium- term economic outlook, as well as concerns over the effect of increased volatility in world financial markets on the global economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while the signs pointed to continued upheaval in the short term, the longer-term outlook is positive, says Van Rensburg. The key to realising this potential is the successful implementation of the government's growth strategy. &quot;We have to prove the sceptics wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Reserve Bank's growth projections for this year are still on target, says Van der Merwe, although &quot;we are more inclined towards 3% than the original expectation of a 3,5% increase in gross domestic product (GDP).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Agriculture and non-gold mining are doing very well, and we are optimistic this trend will continue for the rest of the year. Next year may be a different matter -- two good agricultural seasons in a row may be unrealistic.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its macro-economic strategy, unveiled two months ago, the government's model was based on GDP growth of 3,5% this year and 2,9% next, to reach 6% by the year 2000. And while most economists have pencilled in a more realistic 2 to 2,5% for next year, a dip in the growth rate will not derail the government's plan, says Van der Merwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The likelihood of lower growth in 1997 was taken into consideration, but there is still a very good chance that we'll get to 6% by 2000. We're not entering a recession -- this is merely a cyclical blip. We are no longer experiencing the boom-and-bust scenarios of previous cycles, so it is only normal that the economy should grow at a slower pace in some years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacob's Van Rensburg agrees: &quot;The world economy is enjoying good growth, which will stand us in good stead. It looks now as if the growth baton is being passed from the United States and Japan to Europe, so there is no threat of a sudden downturn.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instability on the world's financial markets is a concern, however. In an ideal world, we could have used an easier monetary policy to underpin the growth rate, says Van Rensburg, as the option of fiscal expansion is closed to us because of our Budget deficit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indeed, if not for the latest crisis, the Reserve Bank may have considered lowering interest rates. But the rand is continuing to dictate monetary policy, and its roller-coaster performance seems likely to continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With the rest of the world suffering similar upheavals, South Africa cannot hope to remain immune,&quot; says Van Rensburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The rand is being tested by speculators. Exchange rate movements are not just the product of investor sentiment; with the extent of speculation on world markets and international capital flows, we accidentally get in the way and get bruised. The Reserve Bank must now concentrate on minimising the potential for financial instability,&quot; says Van Rensburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The last thing we need in the middle of implementing the macro-economic strategy is for volatility in the financial markets to jeopardise the whole operation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The threat of another rise in interest rates is also damaging confidence. &quot; We must try to avoid an increase at all costs,&quot; says Van Rensburg. &quot;The last hikes did a great deal of damage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the immediate crisis had passed, with the rand pulling back from the brink after reassurances from Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals that he had no intention of resigning, backed by President Nelson Mandela, the markets were still unsettled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sacob was due to meet the Reserve Bank chiefs this week and was expected to emphasise the danger of another hike in interest rates. &quot;It should only be contemplated as a last resort,&quot; says Van Rensburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, the government should push ahead with its macro-economic strategy: &quot;The sooner South Africa can create a credible track record for the implementation of the economic strategy, the better its chances of strengthening investor and business confidence.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The white, male edifice of the South African judiciary sustained another blow this week with the announcement of three new women judges. The three, attorney Kathy Satchwell, Geraldine Borchers, SC, and Vivian Niles-Duner, will bring to seven the number of women on the Bench.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will join the small club which includes Constitutional Court judges Yvonne Mokgoro and Kate O'Regan, Judge Lucy Mailula and Judge HN Traverso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are 173 judges in South Africa. The new appointments by the Judicial Service Commission still have to be confirmed by President Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The call by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to have apartheid judges testify at the truth commission could throw some fascinating decisions into the public spotlight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, there is the judge, presently a member of the Transvaal Provincial Division, who made a name for himself by slapping a fine on a farmer who beat a labourer to death. The same judge also pronounced that a series of savage beatings by state-supported tribal authorities in Namibia in 1974, which left victims with life-threatening wounds, were proper. He declined to allow an interdict against further beatings -- which involved stripping victims in public and flogging them with rods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chief Justice Rumpff, however, felt differently and upheld the appeal against this judgment with costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Ben Johnson is a lonely man. Always with him are the harsh judgments and sustained mockery of those who condemn him for testing positive for steroids after he won the 100m dash in a record shattering 9.79 seconds at the 1988 Olympics. He did not sink into hopelessness after Seoul, but he remains wounded.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The emotional scars run deep and Johnson's relationships with others are filled with mistrust. He rarely goes out. He has hardly any friends -- &quot;all gone after Seoul&quot; -- and spends a lot of his free time jogging and lifting weights at York University to keep in shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He left his girlfriend over a year ago, and has since continued building a wall around himself and his family. &quot;Everybody wants something from me,&quot; he said. &quot;Like thieves, they rob and leave. That's enough. I'm not a circus freak.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He doesn't hold anything against Charlie Francis, his former trainer, who admitted to the Dublin Commission, a panel that studied the use of drugs in Canada by Olympic athletes, that Johnson had been using steroids since 1981. &quot; Why should I hold it against him?&quot; Johnson asks now. &quot;He told the truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson has rarely spoken to the media since Seoul, where he was implicated in the greatest scandal in the history of the Games. Everyone remembers: on September 26 1988, after an anti-doping control test found stanozolol, an anabolic steroid, in his system, Johnson became the embodiment of disgrace.  His medal was taken away and he was sent home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson does not look at Seoul as the most humiliating experience of his life, but rather as the moment he established himself as the fastest sprinter in the world. 'No one ever ran the 100m dash in 9.79. No one. And it's going to take years before it can happen again. I am the fastest man in history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson has no remorse. He is convinced others in the 100m dash were steroid users as well. &quot;They know it. I know it. That's all that counts. Yes, I was taking steroids,&quot; he said, &quot;but so were others on the starting line that day,&quot; an accusation that has been vehemently denied. &quot;Good for them if I was the only one disqualified, but the fact remains: I was the fastest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bitterness he felt when he left South Korea under the evil eye of the public hurt him more than the loss of his medal. &quot;If people are naive enough to believe that athletes don't take drugs, that is their problem, not mine,&quot; he said. &quot;A cheater goes around the rules to win. That is not what I did. I followed the same rules as the others. Those who treated me as an outcast are hypocrites.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As they approached the bend in the 200m final, the leaders were even making their differences seem mere matters of style. Frankie Fredericks, the Namibian who finished second in the 100m five days earlier, ran so tall and long that Michael Johnson, with his lower knees and shorter gait, looked like a trotter at full stretch trying to stay with a thoroughbred.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But then, passing 100m in 10.12seconds, the trotter really began to sprint, and showed a marvelling world that he really is the reincarnation of Jesse Owens. The hero of the 1936 Olympics said he ran as if the track was the top of a hot stove. Johnson, burning through the second 100m in an unbelievable 9.  20, perfectly embodied Owens's technique.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Johnson was a single stride from the finish, the clock on the infield to his left had still not reached 19 seconds. It was only when he crossed the finish line that Johnson allowed himself to look back at it. When he saw 19.  32 and realised he had taken 0.34seconds off the record he had set on the same track in the United States Olympic trials in June, a combination of elation, disbelief and relief spread across the American's face as he cracked the kind of grin that has made Eddie Murphy a fortune in Hollywood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one has ever lowered the 200m record by such a margin. The performance has already been compared to Bob Beamon's phenomenal long jump at the 1968 Mexico Olympics. That stood for 23 years. &quot;This record could outlive everyone who saw it,&quot; said John Smith, coach to Marie-Jose Perec, the French woman who, a few minutes before Johnson achieved the feat, became only the second woman to win both 200m and 400m at the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Forget about the stereotype of the typical boastful Texan; Johnson has always known he can rewrite the record books.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the Games started, he admitted: &quot;The worst pressures are the pressures I put on myself. Real pressure is when you don't know what is going to happen. When I am in 100% shape, I put the pressure on myself to do a very good job, and that means setting world records.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson's voice is a resonant baritone, the perfect vehicle for his matter- of-fact statements about his outstanding achievements. His studious image befits the son of a truck driver and elementary school teacher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six years ago Johnson, called a nerd at high school in Dallas and not long out of university, became the first man to be ranked No 1 in the world at 200m and 400m. He began hearing that he had a chance to brand himself on our collective imagination. Last Friday, when asked if his double made history or satisfied personal goals, he said: &quot;Well, I happen to make it my goal to do something no one else has done, and that turned out to make history.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - To stutter and then triumph, as Michael Johnson did, surely defines the resilience and the brilliance of the human spirit. The question being asked as the cleaners moved in on emptied stadiums in Atlanta, however, was whether the Olympic movement can afford any more false starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sydney in four years' time will come under intense scrutiny. The Olympic movement, sooner or later, will have to make hard choices about the direction in which this caravan is rolling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Representatives from Australia at this blighted tournament have gone home with a book full of problems -- or challenges, as the Americans call them -- to contemplate. There are legitimate concerns, security uppermost among them, along with the very scale of the Greatest Show On Earth. Containing commercialism within the parameters of an amateur ethic that died decades ago is another challenge -- the challenge being to keep a straight face while bowing towards the TV moguls and corporate heavyweights.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We shall all walk away with widely divergent views. The general consensus is that Atlanta, like a gambler down to his last few chips, just about got away with it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some will remember Atlanta more fondly than others. The magnificent human train that is Johnson, who tripped a little then flew to a world record in the 200m, moves on in his golden slippers; Carl Lewis too, growing old disgracefully quick. After tragedy and the inevitable controversies, the friendly, bungling hosts of Georgia's capital count the cost, in reputation and dollars, while dissident voices within the International Olympic Committee ponder a challenge to their aged president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the man whose approval sealed Atlanta's successful bid. There are unconvincing whispers of a coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More important than any grand issues, though, and ineluctably linked with them, was the death of an innocent woman, Alice Hawthorne.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whatever clinical objectivity it takes to compartmentalise the anonymous killing of a 44-year-old mother in the supposed safety of the Centennial Olympic Park is not immediately apparent from this quarter, nor to her injured daughter. If the response to these outrages is measured in the scale of the killing, how many deaths would it take to cancel the Games? You can be sure such a calculation did not delay the organisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Were the founder of the modern Games, Baron de Coubertin, to appear among us now, he might have suggested a substantial pause, perhaps a cessation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, if proof were needed that the Olympic Games have outgrown their fanciful brief, it came in the practical, unavoidable decision to apportion a brief period of time to mourning, to instigate an investigation and to kick- start the juggernaut of Atlanta '96, as unstoppable in tragedy as in the television ratings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bomb went off at 1.35am. As daylight spread on the blood in Centennial Park, Monica Seles was preparing to beat Gabriela Sabatini on the tennis court and Donovan Bailey had geared himself up to demolish the 100m field at the Olympic Stadium a few miles south. The boxers boxed and the veteran American diver Mary Ellen Clark paused on the platform as 10 946 paying customers fell silent for Mrs Hawthorne before Clark carried on to bronze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday was also the day that Jonathan Edwards would believe in his legs and in God. The best in the world at the triple jump, he would falter, for silver only. Edwards's seemingly ambivalent response bears closer examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Immediately after, Edwards queried how anyone could complain about relative failure on the very day that someone had died in such circumstances.  Beforehand he had said: &quot;We've come to jump in the Olympic Games, and nothing's going to put us off that. Once we are on the track, we are thinking about one thing: trying to compete to the best of our ability.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not so odd. At this level athletes are the product of their own intensity. For most, the journey is four years long. The prospect of wasting that investment, knowing the moment passes so quickly, is sufficient reminder of how fragile their finely-tuned skills can be to lift them to sometimes phenomenal heights. One distraction is regarded the same as another and is ignored with the same strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Later, however, the more measured view will prevail among those athletes best equipped to handle success and failure. Edwards is such an athlete. It is impossible, for instance, to imagine him reacting in the same churlish manner as Linford Christie after his disqualification from the 100m final. Or like a wearisome parade of beaten American boxers, whose capacity for complaining about decisions was unlimited and unedifying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amateur boxing has slipped quite a way since the days of Dick McTaggart.  Snooker and darts are in the waiting room; boxing is not far from the wastepaper basket. Perhaps that is Great Britain's hope, after another abysmal medal count: Stephen Hendry mounting the podium, followed by Jocky Wilson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nor should the weight of expectation weigh future Olympians down the way it always seems to do: sport should not be refined torture, although it ought to remain a test of character. Often it is the losers who are winners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Atlanta some handled defeat, or celebrated superiority, with the finesse of a club bouncer. Others were positively uplifting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Devotees of freestyle wrestling were treated to the spectacle of the brothers Zhabrailov, Lucman (34) and Elmadi, four years younger, competing against each other for different countries -- and walking away from the mat smiling. Nobody is quite sure how the loser, Lucman, came to be representing Moldova, and his brother Kazakhstan, but everyone warmed to the presence of Lucman in Elmadi's corner in his failed bid for gold. It was the sort of cameo that typified the old spirit of the Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What more often represents the new face of this huge undertaking, though, is the experience of the defending super-heavyweight judo champion, David Khakhaleichvili of Georgia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Without even a koka to his name, he was thrown out for going to the wrong place for his weigh-in. These Games started off in distressingly punitive mode.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, for those who imagine the litany of complaints from Atlanta about the appalling transport arrangements were the mere whinging of journalists, seek out Canadian fencer James Ransom for an opinion. He was taken to so many wrong venues before arriving at the World Congress Centre that he took the platform for his epee with only minutes to spare -- and lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Olympic movement is to go forward with any confidence from Atlanta, there are those who say it must be without the man who has done much to transform it from a financial liability into a vehicle for generating enormous wealth, His Excellency Juan Antonio Samaranch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He turned 76 last month, but age has only enhanced his imperiousness and there is little sign that he will step aside quietly next year. If there is to be a challenge, it will come from one of two men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first is Primo Nebiolo, a rival with impeccable lobbying skills. An IOC member and president of the International Athletic Federation, he is three years younger than Samaranch and might have more ambition left than his Spanish colleague. He was portrayed in Sports Illustrated last week sitting alongside Fidel Castro and under the headline: &quot;The dictator who runs track and field&quot;. Therein are catalogued the dictator's weaknesses, chief among them a lust for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It might be an easy transition. Last year Nebiolo, supported by Brazil's Fifa president, Joao Havelange, and the Mexican media and sports magnate, Mario Vasquez Rana, had the IOC put the retiring age for the president up from 75 to 80. This would allow Samaranch to continue next year -- as well as letting Nebiolo go for the job in 2001, when he will be 78.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other contender is an altogether different player. Dick Pound, elected as an IOC vice-president last month by two votes ahead of a septuagenarian from India who has survived several heart bypass operations, was in the news for all the wrong reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walking across a street in downtown Atlanta against the lights late on Wednesday night, Pound and his wife Julie were reprimanded by a traffic policewoman. A slight altercation ensued. Mrs Pound, who was said to have been drinking, is alleged to have kneed the officer in the groin -- and on Friday she was in court, charged with public order offences. While it is not the crime of the century, Pound's political opponents within the IOC could seize on the incident if he chose to launch a campaign for Samaranch's job next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That would be unfortunate. Pound, an IOC baby at 54, is a Montreal lawyer and former Olympian who talks sense and is widely respected among the silent army of IOC members who rarely speak out against Samaranch or Nebiolo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pound has served on many IOC sub-committees and has helped negotiate television rights since 1983. He has a supporter in the similarly youthful Australian IOC member, Kevan Gosper, although he too was only voted aboard last month by a couple of votes and does not have an established power base.  An insider said Pound is unlikely to move as 'he doesn't have the numbers -- the network of Samaranch and Nebiolo is too strong to break'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Nebiolo arrived here he was upset to find that Samaranch had commandeered the top floor of the designated IOC hotel, the Marriott. Nebiolo kept his relatively meagre accommodation there -- and also booked a penthouse suite at the Hyatt. A man whose ego cannot be housed in a single hotel suite is a man to be watched.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - According to the feedback from the Atlanta Games, Britain is a cash-strapped uncompetitive backwater which has lost the knack of producing sporting heroes. All the odder then, that an English football club has just set a new world transfer record for an English player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alan Shearer is nothing if not a hero. A comfortable inheritor of the great English centre-forward tradition which encompasses Roy of the Rovers as well as Lawton and Lofthouse, the clean-cut England striker is that most unfashionable and uncomplicated of footballing anachronisms, an ideal role model. Neither this nor his undisputed scoring ability necessarily makes him worth u15-million, but most of the shock-horror headlines of the past week related to the fact that an English club had signed the record cheque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is almost as if we would have preferred Milan or Barcelona to come along with the silly money and whisk Shearer from our shores. We would not then have considered the fee so excessive, we would have taken a quiet pride in making Italian or Spanish eyes water as a fair price for obtaining the very best of English talent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Newcastle throwing their money around makes us nervous. The game has gone mad. The roof will fall in. Yet Newcastle, the club who picked up u7-million for Andy Cole, would probably have accepted at that point in the 1994-95 season that z15-million for Shearer in 1996 was not excessive or illogical, but simply the going rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is anyone really worth that much? Possibly not. Put the question another way. Is Shearer twice as good as Cole, or three times the player Chris Sutton is? Thought so. Looked at in a purely footballing context, Newcastle have hardly gone out on a limb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet there are several intriguing aspects to the deal. The Bosman ruling was supposed to drive prices down, not up. In time Shearer's move could come to be seen as fin de siecle old-style transfer market, a last spending splurge before freedom of contract obliges clubs to act more cautiously, but somehow one doubts it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Major transfers always tend to have an immediate inflationary effect.  Blackburn now have u15-million to spend, for a start, and Manchester United will be wanting to match Newcastle in both the goalscoring and attention- grabbing departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the way Shearer managed to leave Ewood, very much against his employers' wishes while still notionally under contract, was more typical of the new style of player-club relationship than the old. The casual observer may be wondering what is the point of a contract at all if a single escape clause effectively undermines the whole agreement, and all but the very biggest football clubs will increasingly find themselves pondering the same thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bosman effect is one of polarisation, and at the top end of the scale, among the elite of clubs who can afford to pay wages of u30 000 a week, the huge transfer fee is unlikely to go out of fashion.  As in the latest deal, rich clubs will find themselves trading with each other, particularly if players are allowed to write clauses into their contracts which amount to guarantees that a club will not only attain but maintain a certain level of success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What level of success Newcastle can expect with Shearer in their side will be the talking point of the new season. Kevin Keegan described his capture as a signing for the people of Newcastle, which may have been a clever way of admitting that the club wanted Shearer more than they actually needed him.  For in business terms Shearer is almost a luxury. Newcastle are already trading at capacity and will be unable to shift any more season tickets on the back of their new buy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prior to last week they had a waiting list of 12 000 for seats at the 36 000-capacity St James' Park, so the market was not exactly in need of stimulation. Newcastle have plans for a 75 000-seater stadium, which few doubt they could fill, but it may be several years down the line and could involve leaving town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">St James' Park can be expanded by only around 8 000 seats, but that would cost more than Shearer and the end result would still not be on the scale Sir John Hall has in mind. So Newcastle are going to have to sell a lot of shirts to recoup their outlay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merchandising is big business these days, but not that big, and Newcastle shirts have always sold well in any case. If there is a business motive behind the transfer, it is more likely to be connected to the club's impending flotation on the stock market, when Hall could quickly see a return on his investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Keegan's point of view, the benefits of having Shearer in the side are obvious, even if it will ultimately squeeze out Ferdinand, Asprilla, Beardsley or Ginola, all players the manager has gone out of his way to vigorously defend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That little local difficulty aside, Keegan still has to face the fact that it was defensive shortcomings which cost Newcastle the title last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While an extra 20 or 30 goals may well obviate the problem in a positive way, the addition of Shearer to the Newcastle roster does not quite invoke the chill which would have descended on all the other Premiership starters had the same player ended up at Manchester United.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Alex Ferguson's double-winning team struggled only for goals last season, relying a shade too heavily on Eric Cantona's penchant for scoring, and the replacement of Cole by Shearer would have given Old Trafford an enviable cutting edge at home and quite possibly in Europe. For preventing the Premiership turning into a one-horse race, and preserving the possibility of at least two or three runners contesting the finish, we are apparently indebted to someone at Blackburn, who according to Manchester United's version of events would not countenance Shearer moving to Old Trafford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This sounds a little like face-saving, and overlooks the possibility that Shearer might have preferred a move to the North East, but somewhere on a Lancashire golf course Kenny Dalglish probably allowed himself a wry smile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dalglish was the manager who brought Shearer to Blackburn four years ago, amid widespread fears that he had paid over the odds at u3,3-million, and Dalglish was in charge when Rovers won the Premiership title.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a matter for conjecture now whether Blackburn's success could have been sustained had Dalglish remained manager, or whether even Dalglish's pulling power could have kept Shearer at Ewood after his exploits in Euro 96.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been talk of Dalglish returning, but if that was on the cards surely it would have been Dalglish and not Walker trying to persuade Shearer to stay. With any luck, the reasons for Dalglish taking a back seat will be illuminated in his forthcoming autobiography, but that will be of little help to Walker, who can only look enviously at the Newcastle operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hall and Keegan have basically pinched his idea, as well as his striker, though they are pitching to a much more receptive audience and refusing to define their ambition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walker always insisted there was a limit -- he intended to take Blackburn to a certain point then leave them. So much for Lancastrian common sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blackburn are arguably further from where Walker wants them to be than they have ever been. Only time will tell if the balance sheet adds up, but the brash Geordies have established a clear lead in the confidence stakes with a much simpler maxim: Keep on Spending.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In just over two hours and 12 minutes on Sunday a simple and largely unheralded young man from the Eastern Transvaal changed the face of athletics in South Africa forever.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Josia Thugwane's marathon victory in the Centennial Olympic Games vindicated everything that has ever been said about the Mathews Temanes, Mathews Motshwarateus, Zithulele Sinques and all the other great South African runners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These athletes never had the chance to show the world what they were capable of, but on Sunday Thugwane proved that we too can do what the Kenyans have done. Indeed, as Kenyan athletics coach John Velzian said last year, South African athletics was just waiting for a spark which would light the fuse and lead to an explosion.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Velzian speculated that in Atlanta Hezekial Sepeng might just provide that spark. Sepeng kept his part of the bargain last week but nobody expected there to be such a short fuse before the big bang came.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether or not Sepeng's superb performance played any part in firing up Thugwane and the other South African marathon runners, they certainly looked like men inspired on Sunday. Always in the lead bunch, it was a sight to behold when Lawrence Peu, Gert Thys and Thugwane broke away at the front of the field just after the halfway mark.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although they didn't stay there long, that image of three supremely confident Olympians in the green and gold was beamed around the globe. The message was clear: the learning curve is over, South Africa has arrived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while Thugwane's victory has the potential to change South African athletics, there can be no doubt that it has changed his life irrevocably.  The 25-year-old cleaner at Koornfontein Coal Mine will never have to hold another broom in his life and, with the right guidance, should be a millionaire by the year's end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But therein lies the biggest dilemma. Thugwane has achieved what he has in an environement with which he is comfortable. He is young enough to do it again. Change that environment too much, as the vultures now hovering around him are likely to do, and he could become the next Lucketz Swartbooi -- Namibia's 1993 world silver medallist who was exploited and over-raced until he gave up running.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not that Thugwane whouldn't be allowed to enjoy his hard-earned success and the riches that go with it, but he should be the one who makes the decisions concerning his future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That Thugwane had the potential for greater things was apparent from the day he won the South African marathon title in 1993 after taking up the sport a few years earlier. American-based athlete's agent Tony Longhurst, who managed Thugwane from 1993 until he was suspended without a hearing by Athletics South Africa at the end of last year, was not surprised by Thugwane's victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I always said that one day Josia was going to pull off the big one. When he won the South African title in 1993 you could see the guy had talent, but there was no structure,&quot; recalls Longhurst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That was when Longhurst brought in Bobby McGee, widely regarded as one of South Africa's foremost distance coaches. &quot;It was more a case of taking what works for the westernised athlete, looking at Josia's environment and changing the parameters a little to take his culture into consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You saw the results on Sunday. He was so professional. Everything he need to do he did and he got it right to a T. You would think he'd been on the international marathon circuit for 10 years the way he ran,&quot; says McGee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But McGee is taking none of the kudos for Thugwan's victory. &quot;Josia is actually uncoachable and everything he has done is an absolute credit to himself. Josia is very much a feel runner (like many of Africa's best runners) and he takes what works for him and basically designs his own training programme,&quot; says McGee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this statement is typical of McGee's humility, his influence on Thugwan's career is very much understated for he has been coaching Joseph Skosana for more than three years. Thugwane live in Skosana's shadow at Koornfontein for a long time and still trains with him so that the know-how Skosana has picked up from McGee has been transferred directly to thugwane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What was clearly apparent on Sunday, however, was the technical skills -- what McGee refers to as his professionalism -- that Thugwane displayed during the race. Little things like making sure he gets his drink during the race have come from McGee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even when he and Korea's Bong-Ju Lee and Kenya's Eric Wainaina had broken clear and were racing for the medals he wasn't afraid to drop off the pace a little to ensure he got his drinks and could sponge down his tired legs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also took in more fluid than any of the leading runners -- he often had an ordinary water bottle in his hand during the race besides his specially prepared drinks -- which may have been decisive in the extreme humidity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those are the small details that come from experience and can play a crucial role in marathon running. When Thugwane put in his final surge approaching Capital Avenue Bridge with the stadium in sight he was a man in control who had got it right on the day and in the right place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This medal is for my country and for my president,&quot; said Thugwane, but perhaps more than enaything it offers a new beginning for his troubled sport.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Blacks don't buy books.At least, that is the apparent sentiment of many Zimbabwean bookshops. And yet the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) attracted thousands of mostly black visitors, including hordes of children who packed the reading tents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare's big booksellers display a daunting range of coffee-table books, hard-covered and full-colour, on topics such as cake-decoration and herbaceous borders. They are presumably aimed at white commercial farmers' wives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somewhere round the back, there may be a few local authors, if you can find them. Chenjerai Hove's novel Bones, which won the 1989 Noma Award and has been translated into 10 languages worldwide, is, in the land of his birth sometimes to be found in the medical textbook section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angus Shaw, author of the brilliant Kandaya, says that while the country's leading bookshop chain, Kingston's, had a display of a glossy Princess Di biography, he was told that there was no room for his book as &quot;we can only carry so many titles&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevanji Madanhiri, winner of this year's ZIBF Literary Award for Goatsmell, says his book has never been seen on the bookshop shelves in his home town, Gweru.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With very few exceptions (like once a year at the book fair), a wide range of books relevant to the African experience are hard to find. And yet the demand is there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Brickhill, owner of Grassroots Books, one of the few outlets where African books are prominently available, was responsible for setting up the Book Marketing Trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From 1993 to 1995,&quot; he says, &quot;we did literature outreach, going to rural centres with a writer and a boot full of books for sale at discounted prices.  Over the two years there were about 70 of these, sometimes attended by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 000 people. The writers -- people such as Charles Mungoshi and Chenjeral Hove -- did readings of their works. It was a true celebration of literature, but we couldn't keep up the supply of books. They sold out every time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brickhill is speaking of poor communities. He believes that the &quot;black people don't buy books&quot; myth is exploded when the two factors of accessibility and affordability are addressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're too British in our insistence on high quality. We should perhaps rather follow the Indian example,&quot; he says of the price problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the book fair's workshop on national book policy, Arvind Kumar of the Indian National Book Trust explained how India's massive book market was achieved by fitting the product to the price. He claims that a novel can be retailed at 10 rupees (around R1).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Southern African publishers say the African market is different, that the book-buying public doesn't want second-best. Annari van der Merwe of Cape Town's Kwela Books, said: &quot;Our people equate second-class education with inferior books. They're tired of that whole system and want decent books printed on good paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former member of the Curriculum Development Unit in the early days of Zimbabwe's independence agrees. &quot;We developed a series of low-cost textbooks printed on newsprint and the teachers hated using them. Their dislike rubbed off on the children and they were a failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">George Varghese, chairman of the Zimbabwe Book Publishers Association, said: &quot;Indians are entirely refreshing in their insubordination to Western values.  If you are a low-income Indian you buy cheap books and as long as you can read the printed word, that's good enough.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brickhill said he was about to embark on a new outreach book programme in Zimbabwe -- a &quot;book bus&quot;.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Zimbabwean novelists, even the most successful, have a hard time surviving. In a workshop at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) last week, only two were able to say they earned their living from writing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One then confessed to being a journalist too, and the other, a playwright, admitted his main income comes from performance, not royalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unless a work of fiction is prescribed for schools, print runs of more than 2 000 to 3 000 are rare. Shimmer Chinodya, whose Harvest of Thorns was a setwork which sold 80 000 copies, is a university teacher, and Charles Mungoshi, renowned for Coming of the Dry Season, has turned to film scriptwriting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chenjerai Hove was at the fair to sign copies of his new book, Guardians of the Soil. Produced in collaboration with photographer Ilija Trojanow, it is a journey through Zimbabwe, taking the form of a series of interviews with community elders. Hove described it as &quot;a tapestry of voices&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the idea was to listen to &quot;those who talk about life's essence every day ... We searched for the substance, the root, the beginning which spells the shape of the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - Despite the international press attention focused on the anti- homosexual bigotry for which the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) has become a flashpoint, the fair itself was a commercial success. South African libraries, for instance, did several million rands' worth of book deals at the ZIBF last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Publishers' Association of South African (Pasa) declined to attend because of last year's banning of participation by Gay and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (Galz), it also stated it would not discourage its members from attending. Nevertheless, the South African branches of Heinemann and Cambridge University Press, among others, did not exhibit this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the 220 exhibitors expressed the hope that Pasa was taking this stance on the basis of Moral High Ground and not Low Financial Motives. The fear underlying such comments is that South Africa, already the regional giant in economic terms, would steal the fair away from Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The loss, say participants, would not just be that of money for Zimbabwe, but of an annual event that has established itself as Africa's leading book fair, and one with a unique flavour. Of those exhibiting at the fair -- publishers, booksellers and traders -- some 45% are Zimbabwean, 35% are from the rest of Africa, and around 20% are non-African in origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from the exhibitors' stalls, there is a wealth of workshops and indabas, drawing some 200 writers from all over the world, though Africans predominate. Exhibitors are able to use the fair to tackle the problems that beset publishing in Africa, making valuable contacts, exchanging ideas and extending their commercial enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Publishers such as Cape Town's Kwela Books, for instance, aim to produce popular, affordable and entertaining books for people who have been disadvantaged in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I came to Zimbabwe this year to meet people from the region with specific business deals in mind and I succeeded,&quot; said Kwela's Annari van der Merwe. &quot; But perhaps more important to us South Africans, coming to the ZIBF helps us begin to understand how the rest of Africa works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Literacy organisation the New Readers Project of Durban found the ZIBF &quot; invaluable&quot; in making contacts and selling its titles to the libraries of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In First World publishing, rare are the people committed to African literature,&quot; said Jan Kees van de Werk, a Dutch publisher of African literature. &quot;I feel like a tree calling for other trees to come and form a forest! Once a year we come here, meet with like-minded people and are reminded why we are doing it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is the only meeting place for so many varied levels of book-related activities,&quot; said Peter Ripken of the Society for the Promotion of African, Asian and Latin American Literature in Frankfurt. &quot;We're here to see what's happening in the region and promote it in Europe. We have a small scheme sponsoring a few people to come to the Frankfurt Book Fair so they can see what's happening in Europe and perhaps sell rights to their publications -- but it can never be in the same atmosphere as here.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the ambience of the ZIBF, housed in cutely thatched stalls located in the open air of the Harare Gardens in the centre of the city, is a large part of its appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Large European commercial book fairs are entirely intimidating and demoralising,&quot; said Irene Staunton of Zimbabwe's Baobab and Academic Books. &quot; Here people come to see us on our own terms, because they're genuinely interested and positive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The representative of a Swiss collective of 22 publishers said that &quot;the ZIBF is very professional and international -- but unlike Frankfurt, where appointments are set up at 15-minute intervals, here you have time to talk.  There's a warm atmosphere --- no stress. You meet publishers and writers from places like Jamaica and India, but above all, Africa. It's a network of people devoted to African issues. And it works.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Brickhill, ZIBF trustee, bookseller and publisher, says: &quot;This is where it's real. There are 1 000 people all in the business, talking about books. If you're not here you don't know what's happening in African books.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - PASSIVE RESISTANCE 1946: A SELECTION OF DOCUMENTS, compiled by ES Reddy and Fatima Meer (Madiba Publishers/Institute for Black Research, R75)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the government of Field-Marshal Jan Smuts first announced a new Bill -- what was later passed into law as the Asiatic Land Tenure and Indian Representation Bill in June 1946 -- little did it expect the resistance the Bill would generate. Nor did it imagine that its actions would lead to the Congress Alliance of the 1950s and the formation eventually of a non-racial African National Congress (ANC) that would 50 years later be the government of South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Drawing on newspaper reports, copies of talks and speeches, and political cartoons, Passive Resistance 1946 tries to recreate a sense of the passive resistance campaign in all its complexity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In January 1946 the Smuts government proposed legislation that would prohibit Indians from buying land from non-Indians, allow Indians (male, 21 and over, with educational and property qualifications, of course) to elect three white reprsentatives to the House of Assembly, two whites to the Senate, and three members to the Natal Provincial Council on a communal franchise.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Natal Indian Congress (NIC) and later the South African Indian Congress (SAIC) conference rejected these proposals, seeing them as utterly reactionary. Very quickly they gained the support of an India in transition to self-rule and led by Pandit Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi, who lent their personal as well as governmental support to the protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Events escalated. Soon the Smuts government found itself facing Indian protest and civil disobedience in South Africa and condemnation -- led by India -- at the newly founded United Nations Organisation. Within days of the Bill's passing, the Indian community observed a hartal (protest action) and held mass meetings. Protesters occupied municipal land in Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the weeks that followed, similar protest actions followed elsewhere; the protest was joined by a handful of sympathetic whites, most notably the Reverend Michael Scott, a radical</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Anglican priest, and by a number of ANC members and supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although this was primarily an Indian protest, the ANC supported it and in turn the SAIC saw it as a struggle that was linked to the struggle for justice of all South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the police presence, white thugs attacked the resisters savagely.  On June 30 1946, the first casualty of the protests,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Krishensamy Pillay, died of injuries sustained in one of these attacks. But the protests continued. People were arrested, charged and imprisoned -- but still the protests continued throughout 1946, 1947 and into 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the UN, Smuts took a pounding from the Indian delegation led by Vijayalakshmi Pandit. In a personal meeting with her, recounted by ES Reddy in the introduction, he told her that though she had won the arguments, it was a hollow victory. It would put him out of power at the next elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the campaign was the cause for his defeat or not is open to debate; certainly he was voted out of office in 1948.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reddy and Fatima Meer's compilation tell this story in exciting detail. The documents give a sense of the immediacy of an unfolding drama that is perhaps less well-known than it should be; for, in this campaign one sees the growing together of sectors of resistance to white supremacy in South Africa, in short the slow beginnings of the Congress Alliance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition they document the divisions and tensions within the Indian community over resistance, best expressed in the formation of the conservative South African Indian Organisation (SAIO), which mistrusted the campaign's motives and tactics. The SAIO displayed a familiar South African establishment paranoia, seeing all resistance as communist-inspired.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A notable feature of this compilation is its use of many cartoons by Yusuf Kat, whose work has (unfairly) been overlooked. Simple, almost crude, they articulate the anger and irony of the time through the eyes of one who was most clearly a supporter of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passive Resistance 1946 is not an easy read. It is, however, a valuable collection of documents for historians and all who seek to go beyond the often-bland narrative accounts of the struggle for democracy in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The king of highlife is dead. Emmanuel Tetch (ET) Mensah, trumpeter, saxophonist, bandleader, composer (and, in periods of musical layoff, a practising pharmacist), has died in his birthplace of Accra, Ghana, at the age of 77.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlife music is the archetypal anglophone West African sound. It's still one of the most popular musics of the region. Heard everywhere, from beerhall and marketplace to State House, highlife, like its cousin marabi here, shaped Western dance-band sounds, brass orchestrations and guitar licks to African tastes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And, just as marabi music made its greatest strides when &quot;Zuluboy&quot; Cele perfected the combination of African voicing and Western instrumentation, so highlife -- established in the 1920s -- made the same creative leap in the early 1950s. And the architect was ET.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What happened,&quot; said the man himself, &quot;was that we urgently wanted an indigenous rhythm to replace the fading foreign music of waltz, rhumba, etc.  We evolved a music type relying on basic African rhythms: a criss-cross African cultural sound. No one can really lay claim to its creation. It had always been there entrenched in West African culture. What I did was to give highlife world acceptance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even this mild claim was uncharacteristic for a man whom colleagues recall as modest and self-effacing when not behind his horn. Unlike more Westernised ensembles, his band, the Tempos, featured an augmented rhythm section and lyrics in Ghanaian indigenous languages like Twi, Fanta and Ga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the mid-Fifties, as the only professional band on the then-Gold Coast, they were touring the region and ET had made his first trip to England. In 1956, ET shared a Ghanaian stage with Louis Armstrong, who paid fulsome tribute to his skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Always an innovator, ET returned from semi-retirement in the late Sixties with a new Tempos band incorporating rhumba and reggae influences to appeal to younger audiences. But by the late Eighties his health had begun to fail and two years ago he was confined to a wheelchair by a stroke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Popular Accra paper Public Agenda this week described ET's legacy as &quot;a national treasure&quot;. For fans, there will be a sadness, in the words of his most famous song, &quot;All for you, ET.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ET Mensah's recordings have been reissued on, among others, the Sterns Africa label. Check specialist African record stores like Yeoville's Cadence Tropicale to hear the original highlife sound of Mensah and contemporaries like Guy Warren</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African Koto Bolofo has been picking up awards on the international festival circuit, so why have we never heard of him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Some 30 years ago, a history teacher was accused of communist infiltration: a quotation from Karl Marx had been found in one of his text books. This was criminal under the Bantu education system set up by the apartheid government.  So he fled away &quot;After Mandela was elected to presidency he returned in 1994 to find his people, his rights and what was remaining of his past. His family house had been destroyed, his father's land confiscated, only to discover his abandoned car -- and wandering around the car, the history teacher starts to remember.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So reads the hand-written synopsis of The Land is White, The Seed is Black, in a little booklet scattered among the stalls of the seventh Sunny Side of the Doc International Documentary Market held annually in Marseille in the south of France. Along with two others, I found myself there setting up the South African stand. After two months of frenzied activity we had collected about 20 films and projects in progress from independent producers willing to test how they would fare in an international arena.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catapulted into early summer, Pernod and the heady atmosphere of an international event, we were surprised to find a South African contender in the International Documentary Film Festival held alongside the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rushing to the screening, we were greeted with 16mm black and white low- angle shots of an old man circling a wreck of a car to the strains of Danny Boy. Any resemblance to the standard &quot;returning exile&quot; scenario ended there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Koto Bolofo, setting foot in South Africa for the first time since his childhood, decided to film his father's return after 24 years as an expatriate in Britain. The poignant story of his departure into exile is offset by a set of quirky sequences depicting village life, complete with overtly stylised &quot;village gossip&quot; voice-overs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moving images are intercut with stills. The presence of the camera is repeatedly acknowledged, belying the neutrality of the documentary form.  Children running through a field suddenly face the camera, hold up a clapperboard, and then repeat the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Excited by this unusual depiction of an all-too-familiar story, we invited Bolofo to our stand. And accompanied by his wife, he arrived, overflowing with humour and enthusiasm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spirit of Bolofo's father upon his return, &quot;so cool, so laid back&quot;, without bitterness or anger, is what inspired the making of the film. &quot;The film, for me, was like a contribution -- telling people simply, elegantly and in a dignified, poetic way what the past of a simple man like my father was about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I've seen so many films on Southern Africa in Europe, done by Europeans, that say: 'We blame the whites, they did this to us.' They're very graphic, very black and white. They're easy to understand. My film was just to say that a certain injustice has been done, but there's a way to tell somebody so that we can communicate with one another,&quot; explained Koto.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Molotof Film Cocktail, the French co-producers, had jumped at the mention of South Africa, but Bolofo warned them they were not going to get the usual thing: &quot;The films we tend to see, living in the West, show demonstrations, people being shot. They're all very 'one plus one equals two'. They never have films where people have to think with their hearts. With The Land is White, The Seed is Black, I wanted to find a way to tell a simple story more from the heart than the mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Bolofo's search for this &quot;new approach to tell a story&quot;, the most important thing was an &quot;elegance of how to tell of an injustice that was done in the past&quot;. In the film the emotional reactions of pity or blame are undercut by the irreverent tone. The slightly uncomfortable spectator wonders if this is grotesque caricature, irony or just simple story-telling -- calling into question the certainty with which filmmakers traditionally represent South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sadly, South Africa falls into the trap of an industry way of making films, a cliche. They tend to say: 'That is how the big films are in the West, we must mimic them.' I find there are very few films that express their own truth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being educated in Europe and then returning home was &quot;terrifying&quot;.  Subjected to critical scrutiny and hostile silences as he travelled with his wife, who is white, he felt not much had changed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Could he ever live here? Bolofo says: &quot;When I go there, the country starts to hurt me. It starts to go inside me. So I have to take a step back to make a film like this. I need a neutral country to see from ... It's a very fine line, what I'm trying to project towards South Africa. I've seen many films about South Africa, documentaries, big movies, and the fine line is not there.  I'm not convinced by what I see.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paradoxically, through distancing himself, Bolofo reaches into the heart of the matter. At the end of the festival in Marseille, his film was awarded the Images of Culture prize.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - While worldwide attention is focused on the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, Amnesty International is concerned that one of Ethiopia's few Olympic gold medals winners remains in prison, having been detained for the past four years without charge or trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mammo Wolde won a gold medal in the marathon in the 1968 Mexico Olympic Games, and silver and bronze in the 1968 and 1972 Olympics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now aged 64, Mammo Wolde's health is poor, and has deteriorated during his imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mammo Wolde's case is only one of many. Some 1,700 other former officials also remain without formal charge and have yet to be brought before a court. Although horrendous human rights violations were committed, they have had no chance to defend themselves or challenge their virtually indefinite detention. Mammo Wolde stands accused of involvement in crimes against humanity in 1978 under the government of Lieutenant-Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam - accusations which he strenuously denies. If eventually tried he is likely to face the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a new report Ethiopia: Human rights trials and delayed justice - the case of Olympic gold Medallist Mammo Wolde and hundreds of other uncharged detainees, Amnesty International argues that the detention without charge of all these prisoners is unreasonably prolonged. All detainees have the right to a fair trial within a reasonable period. Amnesty International also opposes the use of death penalty and the likelihood of executions arising from the trials.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the trail of the former Derg government slowly continues, Amnesty International is renewing its appeal to the authorities to accelerate the process of charging and trying all the detainees, which it fears could otherwise stretch on to 2000 or beyond.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In 1995, the Ethiopian youth population (i.e. persons aged 15 - 24 years) are estimated to be 12 million. By the year 2020, young people will number 31 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The difficulties faced by the general population is exacerbated for the young by the lack of adequate opportunities for education and training, unemployment, juvenile delinquency, poor health facilities and services, etc.  This situation is doubly detrimental in that young people constitute the major human resource for development; they are, in many sectors, the key agents for social change and technological innovations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trapped in a vice of poverty, young people are deprived of access to opportunities which could contribute not only to their own development but also to that of societies in which they live. Young people are frequently the last to benefit directly from general progress. Living without basic resources curtails the participation of youth in the lives of their communities and nations. In Ethiopia, faced with too many demands and too few resources, the needs of the youth go unanswered to the long term detriment of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Young people need support if they are to play a central role in society. As a recent United Nations paper recommended &quot;...reviewing and assessing the situation of youth; evaluating and improving existing policies for youth; developing new policies and programs where necessary; mobilizing resources for the implementation of these policies and programs&quot; is necessary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Effective as of August 3, 1996 for new goods and September 30, 1996 for used (or second-hand) merchandise, imports into Ethiopia on a franco valuta basis will be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The term &quot;franco valuta&quot; is not one that can easily be found in a dictionary. If it is found at all, the two component words appear separately: &quot;Franco&quot; means &quot;free of charge&quot; and &quot;valuta&quot; may be broadly defined as &quot; foreign exchange&quot;. So, literally, &quot;franco valuta&quot; would mean &quot;free of charge in foreign exchange&quot;. Practically, franco valuta imports in Ethiopia are those goods which enter the country without the use of foreign exchange held within the domestic banking system, which comprises the National Bank of Ethiopia and other banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are three ways in which imports enter the country and these are: by using the country's own foreign exchange resources; through gifts and grants and through foreign loans. Imports which are purchased by using official foreign exchange (i.e. foreign exchange in the banking system) and foreign exchange recourses of the private sector. But at this point the question of where the private sector obtains its foreign exchange may arise, considering the fact that the holding of foreign exchange by the private sector with the exception of the recently introduced foreign currency accounts for exporters is illegal. Principally, the private sector gets its foreign exchange through the following major avenues all of which, of course, are illegal under present legislation:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Foreign exchange remittances from abroad converted into domestic currency on the black market or through special arrangements;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Foreign exchange conversions from foreign tourists and other travelers in Ethiopia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Receipts from contraband trade in exports;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Underinvoicing of exports and overinvoicing of imports;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Foreign exchange earned by rendering certain services to foreigners;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is therefore with the foreign exchange obtained from these sources that the private sector finances its franco valuta imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the banning of franco valuta imports, the supply of foreign exchange to the black market and the latter's demand for foreign exchange are expected to decrease. This is likely to lead to a decline in the black-market birr/dollar rate, bringing it closer to what may be called the official rate on the foreign exchange auction market. A good part of the foreign exchange demand on the black market may shift to the auction market, raising the birr/dollar rate here. The remaining portion of the foreign exchange demand on the black market could find an outlet in an increase in contraband imports.  In other words, what used to finance legal franco valuta imports would now in part finance illegal, tax-evading goods smuggled into the country. So, the banning of legal franco valuta imports may well encourage contraband imports.  One reason why this may be expected is that importing through the official foreign exchange auction market involves several eligibility conditions including the possession of a valid import trade license and an expiry date for the utilization of foreign exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, will the previous supply of foreign exchange to the black market now shift to the official foreign exchange market? The answer would be, yes. But not all of it would switch to official channels. Part of it would remain on the black market, financing, as indicated, an increase in smuggled goods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, the final upshot may be (a) a shift in the foreign exchange supply from the black market to official channels; (b) an increase in contraband (tax-evading) imports because of the banning of legal franco valuta imports; (c) a rise in the foreign exchange auction market birr/dollar rate because of the expected higher rise in demand than in supply; and (d) a decline in the black-market birr/dollar rate because of the anticipated higher decrease in demand associated with the banning of franco valuta imports than the possible rise in demand for contraband imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From the on-going process of foreign exchange liberalization, is the forthcoming banning of franco valuta imports by the private sector a step forward or backward? Franco valuta imports are legal. The government gets quite a substantial amount of revenue from customs duties levied on these imports. In fact, one other effect of the prohibition imposed on these imports is likely to be a decline in government revenue as the shift in imports from a franco valuta basis to the auction (or Letter of Credit) basis is not expected to compensate for the loss in revenue. On the other hand, some of the financing methods used for franco valuta imports are quite illegal, namely contraband exports destined for financing tax-evading, contraband imports and under-and over-invoicing of exports and imports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By contrast, the conversion of foreign exchange from foreign tourists and other travelers by private foreign exchange dealers is in keeping with the basic objective of eventually creating a free market for foreign exchange.  The same observation applies to foreign remittances being converted into domestic currency by the private sector. Hasn't the government promised that over the next three years exports, public or private, will be allowed to retain one hundred percent of their foreign exchange earnings to do with them as they please, with the possible exception of depositing them abroad? Is it not the wish of the IMF and World Bank, the government's economic and financial mentors, to see the flourishing of private foreign exchange bureaus? Why then discourage some of the foreign exchange dealings on the so- called black-market which are sooner or later destined to be officially recognized and be made legal?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The irony is that the banning of franco valuta imports is likely to lead to a rise in an activity that is truly illegal: that of importing goods without paying taxes due to the government. On the other hand, thousands of Ethiopians receive bona fide gifts in the form of second-hand cars, new TV sets, second-hand or new capital goods and many other items every year from relatives and friends abroad on a franco valuta basis. Why should this free flow of resources be stopped? How are goods brought in by Ethiopians after a relatively short stay abroad going to be treated?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Will they be banned or will they be allowed in, duty-free into the bargain, as promised by the Ministry of Finance without mentioning whether a minimum period of stay abroad is required?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All in all, the rationale behind the forthcoming banning of franco valuta imports does not seem to be convincingly clear. There appears to be no good reason to take a measure with such far-reaching consequences on the simple pretext of controlling the foreign exchange black-market when most of the activities of this market are in fact poised to be legalized in the on going foreign exchange liberalization reforms. Tax-busting contraband imports could be controlled only through reducing customs taxation or through tightening border patrol. The same goes for contraband exports destined for financing contraband imports. On the other hand, some of the foreign exchange dealings on the black-market are ones that could be tolerated in view of the fact that the government's foreign exchange liberalization measures themselves are heading that way. At any rate, some of the major anticipated effects of the ban on franco valuta imports may be summarized as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A loss of a free flow of resources in the form of bona fide gifts and grants from abroad;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The concentration of imports in the hands of a relatively few traders, limiting free competition and possibly raising prices;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A shift in demand for foreign exchange from the black-market to the auction market, pushing upwards the birr/dollar rate on the latter market and downwards on the former;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A net loss of government revenue from customs taxation as the shift from franco valuta to regular (LC) imports is not expected to compensate for the total loss on customs revenue on franco valuta imports;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A rise in contraband imports, especially used clothes which cannot now be imported on both franco valuta and LC bases, contraband imports may increase as a result of possible, attractive import price rises which may be brought about by restricted availability in the wake of the ban on franco valuta imports and red-tape in the alternative LC channel;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, it is argued that it would be difficult for LC importers to present fake invoices, which are deliberately low-priced for taxation purposes, as has been the case with franco valuta importers, the reason being that if an importer produces a low-price invoice to evade full taxation, he would have to lower the amount of foreign exchange he bids for on the auction market, which may not cover the full cost of the goods to be imported. In other words, a low-price invoice to evade full taxation would automatically translate into a low foreign exchange entitlement on the auction market, which may not cover the full cost of the goods to be imported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But what if the LC importer buys part of the foreign exchange on the auction market and part on the black market. Assume the true price of a second-hand car to be imported from some west European country is 3000 US dollars. Suppose an LC importer manages to produce a 1500-USD invoice and buys this amount of foreign exchange from the auction market and the remainder from the black market. Is he not going to be taxed on the basis of the 1500-USD invoice rather than on the basis of the true price of the car which is 3000-USD?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, it seems the effects of the ban on franco valuta imports do not look like they are going to be positive on balance. What we may get in return for the benefit of a proper registration and licensing of importers may be a lot more of the usual government red-tape, import price inflation and a rise in contraband imports besides a number of other negative effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let us just hope that our predictions prove wrong! By the way, we are not talking here about something insignificant. Private sector franco valuta (FV) imports in 1994/95 amounted to well over 900 million birr. As would be expected, the major FV import goods are vehicles, vehicle spare parts, textiles including used clothes (which are difficult to so identify), electronic goods and machinery and equipment. Let us wait and see whether the LC system alone can deliver as much and as effectively without the parallel FV mechanism!</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were appearing in court for the first time after they were committed to the higher court by a magistrate on July 15. Trial is expected to start this Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight, all members of the United National Independence Party (UNIP) of former president Kenneth Kaunda, have been in detention since June 4, charged with two counts of treason and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include UNIP vice-president Inyambo Yeta, UNIP central committee member Rabison Chongo, Kaunda's press assistant, Muhabi Lungu and Kaunda's head of security, Moyce Kalung'ombe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four have also been charged with conspiring to procure, by force, the alteration of the new constitution of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others are retired army Generals Joseph Chintomfwa and Nicholas Zulu, Capt.  Selemani Mpangulu and UNIP central committee member, Patrick Goma, who have also been charged with murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four are alleged to have murdered Gordon Banda who died in a bomb blast at Lusaka international airport in May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eight have also been charged with writing offensive graffiti carrying messages against members of parliament and government leaders, in an effort to force government to withdraw the new constitution of Zambia.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Growing concern about South Africa's faltering economic situation has sparked off intensified pressure on the government to implement key elements of its new macro-economic strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authoritative Johannesburg Business Times reported Sunday that failure by the South African government to implement its macro-economic strategy has prompted economists to call on finance minister, Trevor Manuel, to end policy stagnation and boost investor sentiment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier last week, the department of Trade and Industry did announce a tax holiday package for investors. The report says however, that economists still insist that only a firm announcement on a timetable for lifting exchange controls, or for privatization, can stem recent large outflows of capital from South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Market nervousness reached a peak on Thursday, with the South African Rand dropping to 4.53 to the U.S. dollar and 7.01 against the British pound.  Currently the country's foreign reserves have dropped to 2.5 billion dollars, and it is running a current account deficit of close to 2.7 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will take time, said Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, to give foreign investors the confidence they need. &quot;We are committed to phasing out the controls and must perhaps give further confirmation,&quot; he said. &quot;We must certainly implement the economic strategy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the country's economists painted a bleaker picture, according to Business Times. Stals has his back against the wall, said one economist. &quot;The Bank is trying to keep the currency at a certain level and there is no ammunition to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since South Africa's economic strategy was announced, there has been a noticeable absence of measures to implement it, says Sunday's report. Apart from relaxing exchange controls, investors are also looking for moves on the privatization front. But there is little evidence to suggest that sectoral task groups are anywhere near finalizing restructuring plans for parastatals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another cornerstone of the macro-economic plan -- fiscal stringency -- is proving difficult to implement. Central Statistical Service figures last week showed that employment by the South African government increased from 572,000 in December 1995 to 587,000 in March 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KAMPALA, Uganda - At least 327 people, including government soldiers and rebels, have been killed in two-and-a-half weeks of fighting in the northern Ugandan district of Gulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The number includes 255 civilians, 40 Ugandan soldiers and 32 rebels, including two top commanders, according to casualty figures published in the local press between July 25 and August 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commanders are Lt. Col. Beba Beba Alias Oola and Chief Signal Officer, Capt. Ojok of Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). About 37 people, including 23 students at a local college, were abducted over the same period.  Some later escaped from captivity.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The killings were probably aimed at enforcing rebels demands that people move at least eight kilometers (5 miles) away from all major roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They repeated the warning in two letters posted at Layibi Onang, eight kilometers south west of Gulu a week ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rebels also gave civilians four days to join them and vacate Gulu town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the latest incident, 14 people were killed and 30 injured in two separate rebel ambushes on Friday. Two of the dead were killed when the rebels showered bullets on a Kampala bound bus at Bobi, 24 kilometers (15 miles) from the Gulu highway. On the same day, 12 people were killed when a vehicle they were travelling in hit a land mine at &quot;For-God&quot; village, west of Gulu town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At Ongako trading center, along the Gulu-Pakwach road, LRA rebels also Friday killed six people and burnt scores of huts. The next day, they raided the villages of Labwoch and Payaya in Koro sub-county. They herded several civilians together before murdering 11 people, abducting five youths and burning 56 huts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the most horrendous killings occurred on July 22 when the rebels massacred 60 people in Parabongo, Pabo, and Palwong villages. They accused the civilians of reporting their presence to the state and selling their land mines to the Ugandan army. The government pays some 200 U.S. dollars to any civilian who hands in a land mine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses say some of the victims were chopped to death with hoes, a method increasingly preferred by the rebels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the rebels vowed to capture and kill all journalists, local and foreign, who report on the battles going on in the north. The rebels accused the journalists of telling lies about their operations and calling them killers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Some 20 Burundian women's associations and international humanitarian organizations on Sunday in Bujumbura, called for the immediate lifting of sanctions against Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions were decided on by the Arusha (northern Tanzania) summit of neighboring states on July 13, in an effort to return the country to legal rule following the July 25 coup led by former military leader, Maj. Pierre Buyoya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A statement issued by the associations described the sanctions as &quot;a disturbing step taken against a country whose only wrong is to strive and try to solve its own problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copies of the statement were sent to leaders of the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The embargo will only worsen a situation which is already precarious by starving the poor and war-affected people to death,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo against Burundi was decided on by a summit of Ethiopia, Zaire, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania. Implementation was initiated by Tanzania on August 1. Other countries have followed suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo includes the cancelling of air and land traffic and freight with neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Ethiopia says it successfully carried out &quot;a limited counter-offensive&quot; late last week against a &quot;multi-national terrorist group&quot; along its south-eastern border with Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A government statement released in Addis Ababa on Saturday, said the group, whose name it did not state, had been engaged in terrorist activity for some time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foreign affairs ministry Friday said a contingent of Ethiopian defence forces was engaged in hot pursuit of the terrorist group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said the objective of the operation &quot;was essentially aimed at destroying the base and sanctuaries&quot; of the multi-national terrorist group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement said the operation was concluded after achieving its objectives and that Ethiopian defence forces will continue to remain vigilant, &quot;ready to take similar action in the future to ensure that the terrorist provocations are brought to an end and until the threats posed by the multi- national terrorist groups are fully removed from the area.&quot; The group was vaguely described as &quot;dangerous&quot; and &quot;multi-national&quot;. The statement said its major &quot;goal is to spread terror and to lead the sub-region into chaos...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopia has in the past accused the separatist Al Itihad Moslem fundamentalist group that has over the past three years been involved in hit- and-run operations in the vast Ogaden area, of responsibility for the incursions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al Itihad has in the past claimed responsibility for bomb attacks on government hotels in Addis Ababa and the eastern city of Dire Dawa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group, in July, also claimed responsibility for the attempt on the life of a senior Ethiopian minister of Somali origin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matete scored a time of 47. 83 seconds, a time worse than his Atlanta Olympics performance where he recorded 47.78 seconds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dressed in yellow, with tag 84, Matete looked composed. At the crack of the gun he went on, slowly increasing his speed to the last hurdle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sensing defeat as the count increased, Adkins tried to double his speed but bashed his second last hurdle in the third lane while Matete crashed through the thin air in the fifth lane to victory.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Ten key clauses of the amended Constitution of Zambia were on Saturday condemned by the Law Association of Zambia's (LAZ) Extra-ordinary General Meeting at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre as &quot; discriminatory, contentious and unacceptable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZ fell short of rejecting the entire recently amended Constitution and shut up lands minister Lumizu Shimaponda for attempting to talk fellow lawyers down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to resolutions released at the end of the meeting, Zambian lawyers by a vote of 38 to 19 declared ten clauses in the amended Constitution as &quot;discriminatory, contentious and unacceptable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The identification of the clauses came after one Lusaka lawyer advised the meeting against universal condemnation of the constitution because technically there was no new Constitution in Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyer argued that what has been floated was a Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Act which has altered the 1991 Constitution. And in the circumstances it is the amendments in it which should be isolated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The condemned clauses include the preamble declaration of Zambia as a Christian nation which lawyers argued was discriminatory against other religions and violated the 1991 Constitution on freedom of conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizenship and domicile clause was also dismissed as discriminatory, especially that they classify &quot;citizens into categories of second and third generation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to the lawyers, a presidential candidate should only be declared winner if he has votes amounting to over 50 per cent of the total votes cast as provided for in the 1991 Constitution and not any simple majority as article 34 (8) in the 1996 Constitution demands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is inconceivable how a president who fails to marshall more than 50 per cent of valid votes cast can have legitimacy to govern,&quot; the resolution read.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Part (iii) of the Constitution (Bill of Rights), LAZ argues has been altered without a referendum as required by the 1991 Constitution. One alteration, the lawyers noted, was that giving individuals non hindrance &quot;in the enjoyment of their right of assembly and association ... and in particular to form or belong to any political party, trade union or other association of his interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This right in part (iii), the lawyers said, has now been altered by article 129 in the 1996 Constitution which says &quot;a person shall not while remaining a chief join or participate in partisan politics&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They say the clause that empowers Parliament to make laws retrospectively is dangerous and can be abused to settle vendettas and political scores and want the impeachment procedure for an incapable president to be less cumbersome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers have also opposed the clause which says the law and custom of the Parliament of England shall apply to the Zambian Parliament because this clause &quot;fails to recognise that while in England Parliament is supreme, in Zambia the Constitution is supreme as per article 1(3)&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Laws cannot be imported into a country without due regard to our own constitutional peculiarities,'&quot; LAZ says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZ also wants a 75 per cent majority to be sufficient to waive the immunity of an ex-president before he can be prosecuted for any criminal offences and not the new demand of simple majority to &quot;safeguard against possible political vendettas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers want individuals right to bail restored and the protection of the judiciary from political attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After a protracted debate these resolutions were adopted 38-19 but not after Shimaponda had been severely lashed at.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shimaponda stirred trouble for himself when he told fellow lawyers they were wasting time debating the Constitution because his government would &quot;not renege on its stand&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The only way lawyers would change the Constitution is if MMD lost this year's elections &quot; which it will unfortunately win,&quot; Shimaponda said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he was cut half way by a barrage of statements from irate lawyers who felt Shimaponda had no right to tell LAZ not to make a stand when his party and government had made one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shimaponda was advised by, among others Richard Mukelabai, Lucy Sichone and Daniel Lisulo, that LAZ was an independent organisation whose position cannot depend on that of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lawyers said they would take a stand whether or not government listens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be noted that LAZ took a stand,&quot; one lawyer said. &quot;That it was government which did not listen not that no one advised.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the time the meeting was closing Shimaponda and several government lawyers had walked out with a statement discrediting the LAZ meeting immediately following from President Frederick Chiluba's public relations and press assistant, Richard Sakala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala claimed the LAZ resolutions were political and &quot;not driven by consensus but majority rule&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) president Ben Kapita and ruling MMD Mpika member of parliament, former agriculture minister, Guy Scott, have formed a political party known as the National Lima Party (NLP) which they co-chair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The party which was registered two weeks ago was officially announced at a press briefing in Ndola yesterday attended by Scott but it will be based in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita, in an interview yesterday, said he would resign his position as ZNFU president later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said the party was formed to redress the problems facing Zambian agriculture which had remained undeveloped for a long time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our aim is it to bring the right people to the National Assembly so that the 100 rural constituencies can have a dominant agricultural voice,&quot; Kapita said. &quot;Time has come for committed farmers, agricultural input suppliers and others interested in agriculture and who have good programmes to occupy rural constituencies .&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said he had been lobbying for agriculture for 20 years and now time had come for him to lobby from Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I must do the second phase of agriculture lobby which means you must have someone doing something from inside,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said his party would be a national one because it would also appeal to retrenchees and school drop outs whose only alternative for survival was agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our party is not restricted to farmers,&quot; Kapita said. &quot;It emphasises sectors that create wealth and wealth creation comes from rural areas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said he expected to get support from small, medium and large scale commercial farmers in addition to others who may want to join the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said his party would not field candidates in all the 150 constituencies, but only where it felt someone committed to agriculture was needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita said Scott in his statement at the press conference said he was aware that he would be expelled from MMD for being associated with the formation of another party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to sources, Kapita and had initially entered into negotiations with Rodger Chongwe with intentions of joining the Liberal Progressive Front(LPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was first approached in April and then the last approach was made to our national secretary sometime last week. But then they have decided to form their own party,&quot; Chongwe said in an interview on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita also admitted having approached LPF but declined to comment on the outcome of the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our objective is not State House. There is only one position for President in Zambia. But of the 150 parliamentary seats 100 of them are rural constituencies and agriculture should have been well advanced in this country, which is not the case,&quot; Kapita said. &quot;We are not carrying thieves with us like has always been but we are only fielding those people who have an interest of the people at heart.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refuted reports that the NLP was being backed by the ZNFU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ZNFU is a non-partisan organisation which has nothing to do with the party.  I have already informed the executive of my resignation since I have decided to be partisan,&quot; Kapita said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also announced at a press briefing at Kapita's farm in Ndola yesterday that he had resigned from the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have automatically resigned from MMD. I have failed to realise my dream in the MMD because most of my colleagues have their own priorities and interests,&quot; Scott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott said the party's priority would be &quot;to empower and address the suffering of the rural population&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kapita, however, indicated that the NLP would enter into alliances with other political parties with the same interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka Province MMD chairman, Christopher Chawinga, said in an interview that he was not surprised about Kapita's move since he has always been critical of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Just because he has been president of the farmers union does not mean he can be Zambia's president,&quot; Chawinga said. &quot;The party is a non-starter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on Scott's involvement he said it was not surprising either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have always known Scott, that is why he was suspended from MMD for three months some time ago,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't forget he was fired from his ministerial post by the President for reasons some of us know but which we can't reveal.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - On Saturday some Copperbelt representatives of the country's major political parties were organised by the Committee for Clean Campaign(CCC) to hold the Holy Bible and pledge to promote peace and social justice during the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Symbolically, it was a good demonstration of political will in the quest for peaceful politics. Beyond being symbolic I don't think there was much in the CCC peace act or show.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I think we need to be candid with each other, in order to rectify an unjust political set up that threaten not only the democratic process in this country but peace itself.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We must deal with the causes the real issues that threaten peace in this country, rather than do damage control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We need vision, courage, determination and the political will to change the course of events.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the CCC and others 'concerned' about political instability in the country it is usually as if this emerged from a vacuum. There is a context.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What we need is the vision to deal with the causes in ways that would transform the realities on the ground rather than mere verbal exercises - with Bibles in hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only way to remove political threats to peace in this country is through a just constitution and a credible a electoral process -- that addresses causes of political instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's march to political instability began with signing of the Constitution of Zambia (Amendment) Bill on May 28, 1996 by President Frederick Chiluba. The Bill was opposed by all major political parties and NGOs, including the country's donors, with support only coming from the ruling MMD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peace is no accident of history. It is a systematic and deliberate process, which requires the vision of architects, the mastery of craftsmen and the patience of wise men and women. In the words of a famous philosopher: &quot;It takes men to make war, but great men to make peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest threat to peace in Zambia today the unjust constitutional, and clearly fraudulent Nikuv electoral, arrangements. These fraudulent arrangements cannot be tolerated, accepted or justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba, the sponsor of these arrangements, and his supporters must be shown how humanity deals with inhumanity. Peace is something we not only preach and practice, but also protect. Peace cannot built on injustice as President Chiluba is deceptively trying to do. Peace means building a society in which democracy, freedom of expression and the pursuit of happiness are available to all without discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Peddling costly lies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It seems State House officials, like President Chiluba, have seriously problems telling the truth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday deputy minister in the Office of the President, Lusaka lawyer Eric Silwamba, representing President Chiluba's press aide, Richard Sakala, in a contempt of court case, told magistrate Brian Simango that his client could not attend court because he was in South Africa for a medical review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Sakala had on Monday told Post journalist Masautso Phiri, in a telephone interview from Johannesburg's Carlton Hotel that he was in the country on his &quot;own business&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Tuesday Sakala told South African journalists that he was in their country to try and correct their misconceptions about Zambia that have created by the &quot;gutter&quot; press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What is the truth?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Did Silwamba lie to the court? Can he honestly claim ignorance about the real mission of Sakala that made him miss court?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, Sakala's lie is established, what remains is who paid for trip.  Anyway I don't think even that is a big problem considering President Chiluba's deep pockets -- on Friday my good friend Evaristo Mutale, the President's aide, was sent to withdraw K35 million from the 'oldman's' Long Acres bank account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These may appear to be 'small' lies but spoke volumes about the credibility of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I was, however, delighted that Sakala had the opportunity to see for himself how almost impossible it is to sell lies abroad. Despite high expenditure on public relations consultants, Sakala failed miserably to convince any section of the South African press about 'correctness' of the Zambian Constitution and the government's lack of seriously commitment to press freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Day, in an editorial comment on Thursday, correctly summed up Sakala's futile efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Zambia should know better than to try to sell a flawed constitution in a country whose previous government spent most of this century extolling the democratic virtues of patently undemocratic arrangements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As South Africans know only too well, glib explanations do not change the facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Frederick Chiluba has sent a senior emissary here to persuade the South African public that Zambia is a model democracy. Chiluba would have us believe that constitutional amendments which bar former president Kenneth Kaunda from standing in the October elections were not aimed at Kaunda and anyway are the wish of the Zambian people; he tries to tell us that Western donors who suspended aid to Zambia do not understand the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many countries, likes Zambia now, limit presidents to two consecutive terms, but hardly any prevent a two term president from standing again. Many countries require their presidents to be born in the country, but few require their parents to be born there too. It is these restrictions which will keep Kaunda out of the October elections, asking the world to believe this is not the intention mimics the honeyed deceptions of apartheid's propagandists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Zambians hate Kaunda, as well they might given his autocratic excesses, then they will not vote for him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Chiluba is the democrat and civil rights reformer he started as, he will let Kaunda stand and stop bullying local newspapers. If he is no better than his predecessor, a charm offensive will change nothing.'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angel Chiluba</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The MMD government has problems admitting mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I don't believe there is anyone looking for government of angels that makes nor errors of judgment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government has made many mistakes -- some of them fundamental. The declaration of a state of emergency in 1993, the handling of the Gabon Zambia Air Force plane crash in which the country's national soccer squad perished, amendments to the country's constitution, the detention of eight opposition UNIP leaders and members on stupid and fake treason charges, the Nikuv Computers Limited contract to update the voters' register.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All humans make mistakes, but they to be corrected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this government never wants to accept mistakes and let alone correct them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This places a very high responsibility on citizens to pressurise the government to correct mistakes. But some citizens, especially those who are in one way or another directly benefitting from President Chiluba's corrupt regime, behave as if the country is being governed by angels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have no angels in government -- we have sinful, selfish, greedy and corrupt little men and women. They need to be constantly checked and corrected. Zambia knows no single genius -- there can only be a collective genius.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let's, therefore, put pressure on our government to 'correct' the constitution, the electoral process and to release the Gabon report.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The international community's perception of Zambia is very negative because its image has been heavily dented, disclosed President Frederick Chiluba's public relations and press assistant, Richard Sakala, at a State House press briefing yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala said that the country's image abroad was negative and worrying and called upon Zambians to sell their country positively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala said the task of correcting Zambia's image abroad was not only for the people in public relations but for all citizens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every Zambian should sell our country positively abroad and not leave this job to us people in the public relations and information sector alone, as a country we have a duty to correct the situation,&quot; Sakala appealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sakala, who recently returned from South Africa where he went to &quot;portray a correct picture&quot; of Zambia told journalists that it was their duty to inform the international community that there was no crisis or anarchy in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is our task to tell the world that there is no crisis in this country and that there is also no anarchy as has been portrayed so far,&quot; Sakala said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenyan grain farmers have experienced big income losses since 1994 because of dumping, a study has revealed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sugar industry has also declined because of destructive price competition with imported sugar.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, by Germany's Bread for the World Organization, says the grain losses are attributed to competition by subsidized wheat from the European Union and maize imports from the United States and South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The looming sugar decline is due to the years-long competition from sugar imports from the European Union and Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study, titled &quot;The negative effects of EU subsidized agricultural exports on the agriculture and food security in Kenya and Ethiopia,&quot; also attributes the crises to mismanagement, among other factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It says the losses to Kenya maize farmers amounted to an estimated 439 million U.S. dollars in 1994/95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fall in income reduces the farmers chances of buying production inputs and making the necessary operational investment for the coming farming season, the report adds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Kenya National Union of Farmers has said that the country will face a maize deficit before the November harvest due to bad weather, high cost of inputs and loss of guaranteed markets and prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) representative in Kenya, Harold Norton, recently said Kenya needs to increase its food production by 75 percent over the next 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The annual national maize consumption of three million tons is expected to increase by four percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If market liberalization continues and the food markets are further swamped with dumping imports, and no counter-measures or support are forthcoming from the government, Kenya's already marginalized agricultural households can only be expected to become yet more impoverished, the study further notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It adds that food insecurity will increase in many areas of Kenya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - How to help poor countries reap the benefits of the phenomenal expansion in global communication will be one of the issues to be discussed at the upcoming Executive Board Meeting of UNESCO, its president, Prof. Nureini Tidjani-Serpos, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues surrounding the 'New Information Super highway' will dominate the 'Intellectual Forum' which is being institutionalized at the periodical meeting at the organization's Paris headquarters in October, Tidjani-Serpos told PANA in an interview in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Intellectuals from across the globe will be expected to give their views on the importance and use of new information technologies during the Paris meeting,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at the Forum, which will include top communication experts, will also examine how small and poor countries can be helped to gain full access to modern global communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will also discuss content and ethics --- how to protect young people from exposure to violence and pornography on Internet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tidjani-Serpos, 50, arrived in the Senegalese capital on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is touring UNESCO bureaux and offices in West Africa to discuss ongoing decentralization activities with officials. He has already held talks with President Abdou Diouf and senior government officials and staff at the UNESCO Bureau for Education in Africa (BREDA), one of the organization's 58 major representations worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He will also visit Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo and Nigeria during the four- day tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Decentralization is top most on the agenda launched by Director-General Federico Mayor soon after he assumed office in 1987.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ultimate goal is to bring the civil society to take charge of a wide rage of issues which touch on their daily lives,&quot; Tidjani-Serpos said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNESCO's role as an advocate for peace, he said, has even become more relevant in the unipolar world as wars, ethnic cleansing, terrorism, marginalization and other forms of social strife continue to wreak havoc on humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tidjani-Serpos, a Beninese national, was elected president of the 58-nation executive board, the second highest decision-making body of UNESCO, at its general conference in November 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He previously held the chair of Francophone African Literature at the University of Benin, Benin-City in Nigeria from 1980 to 1988 and at the National University of Benin, in Cotonou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was later appointed ambassador and head of his country's delegation to UNESCO in Paris.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign Ministry sources said discussions on Monday centered on the conflict in Liberia which is in its seventh year and has claimed more than 150,000 lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several peace agreements have been signed by the warring factions, the latest being the Abuja Peace Accord of August, 1995, under which a Council of State was installed in Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accord spelled out disarmament, encampment of fighters and elections in September 1996 as key goals. Brutal fighting, however, erupted in April and threw the accord out of gear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), now under the chairmanship of Nigeria, is making fresh attempts to rekindle the Liberian peace process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Burundi's new military regime has announced fuel rationing starting Tuesday, 10 days after economic sanctions imposed by neighboring Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To implement the rationing, fuel coupons were being distributed at the Bujumbura Football Stadium in the city center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An initial rush by motorists eased off as the day wore on.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private cars are being allowed 20 liters (5.2 gallons), minibuses 40 liters ( 10.4 gallons) jeeps 30 liters (7.8 gallons), trucks 400 liters (104 gallons) , trailers 600 liters (156 gallons) and motorbikes six liters (1.56 gallons) per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nicodeme Nimenya, director general at the internal trade ministry, the rationing operation is aimed at stretching available fuel supplies for as long as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the ministry said if the rationing is strictly implemented, current stocks should last over five months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, most motorists see the government measure as a &quot;polite invitation&quot; for citizens to walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Others said that the 10 liters (2.6 gallons) allowed taxis cabs would only prevent their tanks from gathering rust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new ruler, Maj. Pierre Buyoya, came back to power for a second time through a military coup that toppled the democratically-elected government of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya on July 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coup sparked off an embargo imposed by neighboring countries to force the new junta to restore democracy in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi is now isolated from the rest of the world. Its air, land and water links have been cut. The Belgian airline, SABENA, which still maintains flights to the country will wind up soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), Catherine Bertini, has welcomed Tanzania's decision to allow humanitarian aid deliveries to reach Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We hope the same spirit of cooperation will prevail among the other countries of the region to ensure that humanitarian relief operations are not derailed as a result of sanctions,&quot; Ms. Bertini is quoted as saying in a press release received by PANA in Dakar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She praised the Tanzanian government for demonstrating a spirit of cooperation and respect for humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN food agency estimated that 300,000 people in Burundi depended on its relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said over one month of food supplies remained inside Burundi. However, WFP officials said the fuel situation was even more critical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, about 2,000 tons of WFP humanitarian aid have been blocked at Kigoma port, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. This aid was destined for refugee camps in eastern Zaire, as well as refugees and the internally displaced in Burundi. An additional 3,000 tons of WFP aid were delayed in Dar es Salaam and Isaka, a depot township on the Tabora-Mwanza railway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania's decision means that some WFP humanitarian aid can begin moving almost immediately. Under contingency plans, WFP pre-positioned six trucks of aid at Isaka, about 350 kilometers (219 miles) from the border with Burundi.  They are not expected to enter Burundi until Tuesday afternoon.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those deported were ferried on a national carrier, 'TAAG', plane chartered for the purpose.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane, which took off from Luanda, was to make its first stop in the Malian capital Bamako, before continuing to Dakar, Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Lebanese were, however, put on board a 'SABENA' flight bound for Brussels, Belgium, from where they were expected to connect to Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the Malians resisted the forced deportation because, he said, he wanted to travel with his Angolan wife and son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola's immigration director, Carlos Burity da Silva, said the Malian's wife would not be prevented from joining her husband in future if she wanted to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation, code-named 'Cancer II', was launched last week by police in Luanda. It led to the arrest of 748 illegal immigrants from 28 countries in the Angolan capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will be extended to other provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Carlos Burity said those deported had violated Angola's immigration laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said measures were also being carried out to guard against their re- entry into the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - A Zambian court in the northern copper belt town of Ndola Monday sentenced three grave robbers to two years in prison, with hard labor, after they had admitted to exhuming bodies and stealing bedding and clothing from the dead at the town's cemeteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trio were in addition fined 100,000 kwacha (100 U.S. dollars) each for the offence which the prosecution recorded as &quot;trespass&quot; on the cemeteries.  This is classified as a &quot;misdemeanor&quot; under Zambian laws.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men, arrested last week, were said to have confessed to the police that they robbed more than 10 graves and stole bedding and clothing which they later sold as second-hand clothing, popularly known as &quot;salaula.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police recovered some of the items from the suspects and members of the public who voluntarily surrendered them in disgust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndola principal resident magistrate, Roydah Kaoma, who sentenced the trio, said that their action was &quot;repulsive&quot; and that they did not deserve leniency from the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We all want our beloved deceased relatives to lie in peace. I do not feel that you deserve any pity from the court,&quot; she told the convicts, who were reported to be wearing some of the clothes stolen from the graves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, trading in second-hand has slumped as news of the incident spread across the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, business has been tough since last week...many customers have been turning a blind eye to our wares...and have instead started teasing us of being &quot;grave-robbers,&quot; said 24-year-old Evaristo Mwape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mwape, whose Salaula stall at the city center market boasts of some of the &quot; latest&quot; fashions in ladies and mens' wear, said that he had only sold one dress since last Tuesday to &quot;an old lady&quot; who, he said, appeared not to have heard the story.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several salaula vendors who previously made up to 100,000 kwacha (about 100 U.S.dollars) on average per week from sales of the items, said Tuesday that this had dropped drastically in the wake of current &quot;ghostly gossip&quot; among potential customers about their merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certain people in Ndola last week surrendered stacks of salaula clothing and bedding to the police after three men, who have since been jailed, confessed that they plundered local cemeteries for salaula for sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their wares included men's, women's and children's clothing, bedding and other valuables &quot;grabbed&quot; from corpses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police found more than 26 pairs of mens' underwear on the suspects who said that they had kept them for their own use. According to them, not many people were interested in buying used underwear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia has a roaring business in old clothing from Europe, Asia, the Americas, some of which are sold in neighboring Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian textile manufacturers have since been demanding that government impose a levy on salaula to protect their business which they say has been adversely affected by the more popular and cheaper old clothing from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neighboring Zimbabwe taxes second-hand wares from Zambian traders who are said to be doing good business, mainly in that country's capital, Harare.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - My Dear Readers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Owen Sichone, writing out of South Africa, has talked about the Zaireanisation of Zambia. This charge is of serious concern for a country that was developed on the British system of government. Its deterioration came into focus recently during the Mushota tribunal. The tribunal proceedings brought out the conflict between civil servants and politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To support Sichone's assertion, there is a big difference in the manner Northern Rhodesia and Belgian Congo developed during the colonial period. In Northern Rhodesia a proper civil service was developed which despite the changes over the years has continued until now.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The system has entailed the development of controls on how public funds are handled under well defined government financial regulations. Simply, parliament votes funds for ministries and permanent secretaries are the controlling officers and not ministers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Zaire to retain power in perpetuity, President Mobutu Sese Seko has made himself chief pay master and chief banker of the country. Mobutu decides what denomination to issue, how many and who keeps the money. He also decides when to pay, who and how much. In turn when his functionaries receive the money from the chief paymaster they too have to decide who and when to pay.  This process filters down to all other functionaries across the line - army commanders, heads of diplomatic missions, regional governors, every one plays his role in handling government funds. In Zaire it is normal for a boss to treat government funds as his own until he decides to whom and how much he should pay. Thus it is not surprising for civil servants in Zaire to be unpaid for several months. That is normal practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When President Chiluba came to power in 1991 his politics towards Zaire were rather confused. Perhaps he was merely being careful. A meeting between Chiluba and Mobutu at Gbadolite changed that and from then he began emulating his new mentor, the Zairean dictator on how to survive donor pressure. Thus Chiluba has learnt to transform himself from a poor trade unionist to a rich paymaster, controlling the purse of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not surprising therefore that the President's role in the Third Republic has grown as chief banker and paymaster with the approach of this year's elections. Suddenly Zambians have to look to Chiluba for money. The president has taken the role of deciding and approving projects and their budgets. Now President Chiluba through his gifts decides what is good for the electorate. Thus to keep this image the President has travelled across the country giving gifts of K20m here, K30m there, inspecting this school or that community for a bridge or hospital building and in his benevolence he dreams the amounts. Hence like his Zairean brother Chiluba has changed the presidency and transformed it into the main budgetary control centre. Somehow, Chiluba is effectively the chief paymaster and the banker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I am aware, for instance, the President now keeps billions of Kwacha and several millions in various currencies within his State House central bank.  Unfortunately, Bank of Zambia governor Jacob Mwanza is aware of this fact but he is powerless despite the fact that it is a violation of the country's laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt the Zairenisation of Zambia starts with the control of government funds and that President Chiluba is at the centre of it. His ministers, Mushota included have been trying to emulate their master. But to keep donor confidence, they have maintained laws relating to financial regulations though they are continuously violating them. For instance early in the MMD term MPs were benefiaries of this approach to government funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is for the sake of the Zaireanisation process that during his first visit to Arakan Barracks after being appointed minister of defence, Ben Mwila told officers to make money because their salaries were inadequate. The officers have taken him on his word and gone to town to make money from the institution they are serving. They and their wives have become the chief suppliers to the defence force. I chuckled the other day when I saw a news item in the government owned Zambia Daily Mail announcing a donation of K4m by wife of airforce commander Ronnie Shikapwasha to wives of officers based in Mbala. I chuckled not only because there is no constitutional basis for her benevolence but because by the simple logic - where can an ordinary officer's wife get that kind of money other than the fact that the whole defence structure has become rotten.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thus rather than ending, the Zaireanisation process of Zambia is on track.  And like all processes it feeds on itself. We will see more donations from the &quot;father&quot; of the nation - the chief banker and paymaster - President Frederick Titus Jacob Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I love you all, Masautso</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipata - National Party President Humphrey Mulemba says the ruling MMD government should urgently rectify mistakes in the current voters registers to help prevent a national crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mulemba said government should treat this matter with the urgency it deserved because it would risk retarding the development of Zambia's new and fragile democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told ZANA in Chipata today that the anomalies that had been found in the registers would make some people not to cast their votes in the forthcoming parliamentary and presidential elections if government did not take action to address them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''There is a crisis in this country in regard to the verification of voters registers and many concerned stakeholders in the election process are still guessing what will happen next if government did not rectify the anomalies,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mulemba also advised government to respond favourably to opposition demands that were tabled before it during the inter-party talks to create an enabling environment during the the forthcoming general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the new constitutional ammendment bill was hazy and discriminatory and for that reason government should sort out its differences with the opposition political parties, churches and non-governmental organisations to ensure a fair and free elections this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Above all, he urged the government to create an independent electoral commission because the current one was not free as it was operating at the whims of the ruling party.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Local travel agents last Friday expressed displeasure at the lengthy border formalities between Zambia and Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most of our clients end up missing their connecting flights simply because of being made to queue up endlessly,&quot; carped a Lubi Travel representative.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; There must be provisions made by the Zimbabwe customs officials for connecting passengers so as to serve the interests of both parties.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agents made their views known at a trade promotional event hosted by Carribean Bay Hotel at Intercontinental Hotel. Carribea is situated in the Zimbabwean border town of Kariba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sales manager of the Carribea, Lionel Sivule, assured the Zambian agents that the region was working towards smoothening border relations and Zimbabwe would not be left behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would not serve both the interests of Zambia and Zimbabwe if border procedures were left as they are,&quot; Sivule said. &quot;I am sure the authorities are working on it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zimbabwe High Commissioner to Zambia, Tirivafi Kangai, dismissed claims that they were taking eight days to clear visas for Asian tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The most we take is three days. We understand that whereas before, the region's emphasis was on politics, on apartheid, it is now on investment and trade,&quot; High Commissioner Kangai said. &quot; We do not desire to jeopardise any investment opportunities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian travel agencies had complained of loss of business because some tourist parties had changed their minds after waiting an inordinate amount of time for their visas. They also complained of the Zimbabweans' slow response to customer demands from the Zambian side.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The event was attended by about seven travel agencies from Lusaka and Ndola.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture, Food and Fisheries permanent secretary, Dr Austin Sichinga said today a feasibility study on the exercise has already been done by a German consulting firm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Sichinga said government is still waiting for a response from the German government on when the repair works will commnence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The German government had insisted on a food reserve agency to be put in place before the rehabilitation exercise is started.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Sichinga said his ministry has fulfilled the condition and that the agency is already in place but the Germans have not responded yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said two of the silos are however beyond repair and will not be part of the rehabilitation exercise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six silos are situated in Kitwe, Kabwe, Lusaka, Choma and Monze.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Sichinga also revealed that the 350 small storage bins have already been rehabilitated and let-out to the private sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Trade talks between Zambian and Zimbabwean manufacturers and exporters have stalled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters came to a standstill after the Zambia Association of Manufacturers (ZAM) disagreed with the Zimbabwean proposals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The main issue we have to agree on is the duty structure,&quot; ZAM chairman Mark O'Donnell disclosed in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We want to see equity. The first draft of the agreement was too favourable to Zimbabwe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apparently, the Zimbabwean market had been protected with slightly higher import tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">O'Donnell said a meeting between the Zambian commerce ministry officials and the members of ZAM agreed that some points had to be modified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZAM, however, hopes that the government will not make other alterations in the nation's economic policies to upset the imminent agreement with Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to O'Donnell, the 1997 budget and tariff structures must be carefully constructed to fully protect the Zambian producer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I will be very surprised if this government causes more damage to industry, &quot; O'Donnell said. &quot;The last thing we need is for the government to go back on its word.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But acting permanent secretary in the Ministry of Commerce, Oliver Sikufweba, said the onus was now on the Zambian manufacturers to organise themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problem lies with our manufacturers here to work out the structures they want,&quot; Sikufweba said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government has been urged to prioritise tobacco production in its crop diversification programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco Association of Zambia (TAZ) executive director, Graham Wallace, in an interview yesterday said it was among the most profitable crops and has a high potential as a foreign exchange earner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Wallace advised local farmers to venture into tobacco production if the agro sector was to be a major foreign exchange earner as was the case in Zimbabwe and Malawi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Generally they talk about food security and once this is satisfied, as is the case, the government should also start prioritising high income earning cash crops like tobacco,&quot; Wallace said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wallace disclosed that research carried out by his organisation had placed Zambia as having better conditions for tobacco farming compared to other countries in the region, such as Zimbabwe and Malawi, which had been raking in over US$600 million and US$200 million in annual tobacco exports respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have great potential, imagine Malawi gets 70 per cent of its foreign exchange earnings from tobacco and has nearly the same population as Zambia,&quot; Wallace said. &quot; We are at an advantage in that our climatic conditions here are better than the other countries' for tobacco production.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with the current meagre 160 farmers registered under TAZ, Zambia expects to raise over US$10 million in tobacco exports this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tobacco, compared to maize production, has however enjoyed vast assistance from TAZ through extension facilities to farmers, credit facilities and sound marketing which is entirely handled by the association on behalf of the farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Wallace's sentiments follow ZNFU executive director, George Gray's, calls on farmers last week to venture into other crops as the prices for maize had continued to drop.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to FAZ acting general secretary, Julio Chiluba, France could not accommodate the friendly game against Zambia because of their busy schedule this year while Portugal were said to be overhauling their coaching staff and team.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Chiluba announced that the soccer body had now set their eyes on Estonia and Kenya to help the squad prepare for the World Cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Because of the negative responses from France and Portugal, we have invited Kenya for a friendly match. We have also received a request from Estonia, if we finalise the deal with the two countries the games would be played at Independence Stadium,&quot; Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added: &quot;I can safely say that a lot of ground has been covered in as far as the game against Estonia is concerned, we have set a tentative date for the friendly but I will announce it later.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting FAZ chief also said his association was waiting for China to respond to their proposal. He assured the nation that the squad will play some friendly matches before the 1998 Africa Cup opener against Mozambique in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Chiluba has announced that the senior national team will go into camp next Monday at a venue to be announced before the end of the week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe- Flue-cured tobacco worth about 400 million U.S. dollars has been sold at Harare's auction floors since sales started April 23 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to statistics from the Tobacco Marketing Board, more than 136 million kg (299 pounds) of tobacco had been sold during the period.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spokesman for the board told the Zimbabwe News Agency (ZIANA) that the market for the crop was firm, with no signs to suggest that deliveries were tailing off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Up to the end of trading on Tuesday, more than 136.3 kilograms of tobacco had been traded at the floors at an average price of 28.52 zd (2.85 U.S.  dollars)&quot; per kilo, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We expect the volumes to continue firm. As you are aware we operate on a quota system which ensures the same quantity is maintained throughout the marketing season,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total tobacco output for this year was estimated at over 200 million kg (440 million pounds), up from 190 million kg (418 pounds) last year which fetched 320 million U.S. dollars at the floors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The crop is expected to earn farmers more than 700 million U.S. dollars following the expected increase in world tobacco prices caused by the damage to the American crop by a storm.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi - Burundi is to introduce new working hours following the economic embargo imposed against the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A general consensus has been reached for the introduction of new working hours&quot; designed to save fuel in Burundi, according to a statement released Wednesday in Bujumbura at the end of a meeting between government officials and civil society representatives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The hours, to be announced, are designed to reduce commuting during the working day and help Burundi, which has been hit by an embargo by neighboring states, save fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was attended by representatives of the ministries of labor, crafts, vocational training and public service on the one hand, and representatives of the Burundi Employers' Association and major trade unions in the country on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the statement, the new working hours will be introduced &quot;in public, parastatal and private sectors due to the difficult situation brought about by the economic embargo imposed against Burundi&quot; since August 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the second major change that has resulted from the economic embargo imposed on Burundi by its neighbors to force the new regime in Bujumbura, which took power in a military coup on July 25, to restore constitutional order in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Tuesday, the government decided to ration fuel, with very limited quotas for private vehicles and taxis, which can only get 20 liters (5.2 gallons) each per month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers, meanwhile, noted that Burundi had been cut off from the rest of the world since Tuesday, when the last flight of the Belgian airline, SABENA, took off from Bujumbura. The country is also facing an international air embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military regime in Burundi has intensified diplomatic efforts to have the embargo lifted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - A cow lung disease which has been diagnosed in Botswana poses a serious threat to the entire cattle population of Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If it goes unchecked, the disease, which has so far destroyed 250,000 heads of cattle, could have far-reaching consequences for the beef industries in Sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been confirmed that cow lung disease is already spreading southward from Botswana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's Northern Province Red Meat Producers' Organization chairman, Gert Roets, says the rapidly spreading disease poses a bigger threat to Pretoria's meat industry than mad cow disease, which recently resulted in the banning of British beef here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that a campaign to test cattle entering South Africa was impractical, as there was no real control of animals crossing the country's borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the government could not effectively control the borders, it would have to consider deploying South African National Defense Force personnel to do so, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Transvaal Agricultural Union president, Dries Bruwer, says if unchecked, the disease has the potential of destroying the cattle industries of South Africa's neighbors, where few preventive measures are taken against infectious diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bruwer's union has already called on the South African agricultural union to demand that all member-countries of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) inoculate their herds against the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Unless drastic steps are taken to force SADC member countries to use available South African technology and vaccine to eradicate the disease,&quot; Bruwer said, &quot;the South African red meat industry could be harmed for a very long period, and suffer losses amounting to million of Rands.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cow lung disease was eradicated in South Africa 50 years ago, but officials believe that a new outbreak could prove fatal to the provinces, and the country as a whole.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CHILILAMBOMBWE, Zambia - Zambia's National Council for Scientific Research (NCSR) has announced the discovery of a local plant whose active substance is effective in family planning, controlling malaria, bilharzia and livestock diseases. It also has a vital ingredient required in the making of detergents.  A specialist in tropical public health at the Kitwe NCSR office, Dr Mohammed Shehata told the Zambia News Agency (ZANA) recently it took his team ten years to discover what he termed &quot;the wonder plant.&quot; which grows naturally in various parts of Zambia. Shehata said the plant is commonly known in Zambia as 'endod'. Its scientific name is 'phytolacco'.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the plant which is also available in Ethiopia, the United States and in the Middle East, grows naturally near sources of water like rivers, streams and lakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shehata said his research findings show that berries produced by the plant contain about 25 percent of saponin, an active substance which is effective in killing snails which carry the bilharzia parasite and larvae of anopheles mosquitos, the malaria-causing vector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Saponin is effective in controlling malaria as it kills mosquito larvae when sprayed in areas infested with the insects, eliminates worms which affect the liver in cattle while saponin foam is an active ingredient in making detergents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saponin also kills sperms and can be used as a compound for birth control,&quot; the Egyptian scientist told ZANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He and his team, have over the years developed a technology of extracting the substance from endod berries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shehata said local pharmaceutical companies are free to approach the NCSR with a view to acquiring the technology of extracting saponin from the plant for use in manufacturing various products including veterinary ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The 20 percent saponin content in a berries of endod is the highest compared to plants found in Ethiopia, the United States or the Middle East,&quot; said Shehata who holds a doctorate in tropical public health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since he was recruited by the NCSR to develop an effective drug against bilharzia in 1985, Shehata has established a six- hectare plantation of endod in Ichimpe in Kitwe in the northern Copper belt province, where he harvests about five tons of berries a year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He collected the plants from Luapula, northern, central, western and southern provinces for comparison purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The plant found in Nchelenge in Luapula province have highest potency of saponin and yields of berries compared with those from other parts of Zambia,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hlazo congratualted both Zambia Farmers Union President Ben Kapita and former Agriculture Minister and Mpika Member of Parliament, Dr Guy Scott for being courageous enough to form up a political party that would enhance the agricultural industry in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hlazo who was speaking in interview with ZIS from his L.S. Hacienda hotel in Mumbwa today said the formation of the National Lima Party has been over due since farmers have suffered for too long without any help from the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticised the MMD policy for allegedly sidelining the farmers whom he said have received no or little help from government in terms of securing inputs and as well as marketing of agricultural produce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hlazo claimed that one of the reasons that forced him to resign from MMD is the idea of giving farmers promissory notes adding that some of the farmers' promissory notes have not been honoured up to date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to farmers and the general public to support the National Lima Party saying that if agriculture policies improved, many people especially the non employed and retirees shall have somewhere to go to and earn a living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Hlazo also accused the government for not advertising enough the tourism potential Zambia has saying the country could be earning a lot of foreign exchange brought in by the would be tourists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the government should work hard to exploit all the avenues that could contribute torwards the growth of national economy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Libya has reacted sharply to the United States' assent of the Bill that will punish foreign companies that will continue to do business with Libya and Iran.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite objections from Washington's closest allies in Europe, US President Bill Clinton on Monday signed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 which imposes sanctions on foreign countries that invest in those two country's energy sectors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released in Lusaka yesterday, Libyan ambassador</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to Zambia, Mustapha Braid, said &quot;the the law was unjust as it opposes and contradicts the international laws and Accords, particularly the United Nations Charter that prevents the use of economic sanctions for the benefit of political objectives&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement further states that Libya had cooperated with with the international community in the Lockerbie issue and proved its good intentions and accepted by presenting its two suspected nationals for trial in an independent country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill also received a sharp reaction from the European Union. The European Commission released a statement by EU trade commissioner, Sir Leone Brittan, on Monday recalling that &quot;EU had already said it would act to defend its rights and interests if they are jeopardised by this legislation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The statement further alleged &quot;that the reason for the sanctions was an election campaign pressure on the United States President and growing uneasiness on the part of American petroleum companies on their vital interests in Libya and Iran&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Opposition political parties and the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace (CCJP) have come out in full support of the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) condemnation of 10 key clauses of the amended Constitution of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Liberal Progressive Front (LPF), UNIP and the National Party, in separate interviews yesterday, said LAZ had done well to highlight the objectionable clauses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But ruling MMD Mandevu member of parliament Patrick Katyoka, said LAZ has been hijacked by some political elements within the association.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LPF chairman, Roger Chongwe, said lawyers in Zambia have always been consistent on issues of the Constitution. He said they were consistent in 1964, 1973 and in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What they have highlighted and resolved is supported by all the people of Zambia,&quot; Chongwe said, asking: &quot; Why should the president win the elections on a minority vote?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAZ resolved that a presidential candidate should only be declared winner if he has votes amounting to over 50 per cent of the total votes cast as provided for in the 1991 Constitution and not any simple majority as provided for in article 34 (8) of the 1996 Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chongwe said this amendment was not even in the Government White paper or in the Constitution Amendment Bill. He said it was introduced at the Committee Stage so that they would hoodwink members of parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Katyoka said the professionalism of LAZ has to be called into question because of the political elements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You have the same people talking about consensus on the issue of the Constitution but they go ahead and pass resolutions by way of vote,&quot; Katyoka carped in an interview yesterday. &quot;That is why we in MMD have decided to let the people decide, if they think we enacted a wrong constitution, they will vote us out.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CCJP's Fr. Joe Komakoma said they felt encouraged that an influential group like LAZ has come up with this position.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It just shows how many groups are not happy with the Constitution,&quot; Fr.  Komakoma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNIP administrative secretary, Basil Kabwe, said this government has in the most subtle manner altered the fundamental human rights provided under Part 3 of the 1991 Constitution without calling for a referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some countries, this alone would precipitate a very nasty situation in the land. UNIP has always maintained that the Constitution has not been amended according to the law but has been hijacked by the MMD,&quot; Kabwe said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amongst the 10 clauses condemned by LAZ are the preamble declaring Zambia a Christian nation which lawyers argued was discriminatory against other religions and violated the 1991 Constitution on freedom of conscience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The citizenship and domicile clauses were also dismissed as discriminatory, especially that they classify citizens into categories of second and third generation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party spokesman, Sam Chipungu, said his party wanted this Constitution to be adopted through a Constituent Assembly so that a consensus emerges out of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What LAZ has done is merely what we have always been speaking about. We would have loved the Constitution to be discussed. We have been very consistent on the issue of the Constitution,&quot; Chipungu said in an interview. &quot; We were the ones leading the discussion on issues of the Constitution.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - There are adequate funds to secure the nation enough drugs to run up to December this year, health minister Katele Kalumba assured in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalumba, receiving a donation of drugs from the World Health Organisation (WHO), said &quot;the World Bank has agreed to support a drugs revolving fund to be operational in 1997&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allaying fears of a serious national drug shortage, Kalumba said he did not want to be involved in cheap politics but would rather work &quot;quietly&quot; to the best of his ability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalumba advised the nation that the drug situation in the country requires careful management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What we found on the ground when I took over office in June was that we had run out of money,&quot; Kalumba disclosed. &quot;The 1996 budget had provided K6 billion for the Ministry of Health which was only enough to clear the outstanding debts owed to a number of suppliers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The health minister revealed that &quot;in spite of the crisis we have had with the Constitution, our partners came through with K3 billion at the end of June and the government managed to secure an extra K1 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These funds will secure us enough drugs to run up to December this year,&quot; Kalumba assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalumba, who insisted that &quot;transparent&quot; procedures had been followed in tender processes concerning donor funds, announced that cabinet had also approved the restructuring of Medical Stores, a state owned and controlled drug procurement and supply company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cabinet also approved our decision to start a drug revolving fund.  This requires careful planning and not dramatics,&quot; Kalumba said. &quot;Nobody should jump over me to go to State House or see some finance minister. You have to wait until I'm ready to see you because I'm also busy negotiating with our partners.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kalumba added: &quot;It is time we sat down to examine why we need a second survival plan for Medical stores. We are restructuring management to reduce the cost on tax payers' money.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And chairman of the Medical Stores Board of Directors, Bwalya Chiti, confirmed that the company was owed over K1 billion by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Chiti, Medical Stores was in a &quot;serious financial position&quot; and something ought to be done soon to avert its possible collapse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite being on the verge of collapse, Medical Stores on Monday donated drugs and protein supplements worth K2 million to first lady Vera Chiluba's Hope Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Medical Stores sees in this donation an element of support to Hope Foundation,&quot; managing director Violet Kabwe said, probably 'hoping' the donation will halt 'unfavourable' restructuring of Medical Stores.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National soccer team coach, Roald Poulsen, explained that Chiyangi has been sidelined because of his commitments at Power Dynamos.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiyangi was appointed acting coach after the team fired Webby Chilufya for allegedly failing to execute his duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Poulsen:&quot;I explained to Chiyangi why he could not be with the squad.  We didn't want to interfere with his role at Power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chiyangi is a good player but if included in the squad, he would not be with the team Power and yet his services are greatly needed by the team.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coach said there was still room for Chiyangi if he could maintain his present form and the situation at Power is normalised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Power has contributed three players to the national team, Jones Mwewa, Mwape Miti and Douglas Chiwaya.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia has lost her respect and integrity abroad because of poor leadership, corruption, insincerity and other vices in President Frederick Chiluba's government, charged former president Kenneth Kaunda at the University of Zambia's (UNZA) Great East Road campus in Lusaka on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Kaunda told more than 2,000 UNZA students on Monday night that Zambia's dented image abroad had nothing to do with anybody else but the government itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But chief government spokesman, information and broadcasting minister Amusaa Mwana-mwambwa, who is also a ruling MMD National Executive Committee (NEC) member, said that the UNIP president was speaking as a politician &quot;and so the best people to answer that are his fellow politicians - MMD national secretary, minister without portfolio Michael Sata and party national chairman, Sikota Wina.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNIP president, invited by University of Zambia Political and Administrative Studies Association (UNZAPASA) to discuss the political and economic situation in the country accused President Chiluba of &quot;dodging&quot; important regional summits because he could not defend his unacceptable misgovernance to other nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia has lost out because since he came to power in 1991 Chiluba has been shunning to attend all crucial regional meetings where a lot of important issues are discussed. How can you have a President like that?&quot; the former president asked, amid shouts of &quot;Kaunda mwaume&quot; (Kaunda is a man) by UNZA students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Kaunda further charged that the MMD had a ruthless machinery which had brought lots of misery to the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There has been economic decline and all that Zambians worked for in 27 years has been reversed. MMD has shortened the life expectancy of Zambians,&quot; Kaunda told a packed lecture theatre. &quot;The present climate is not conducive for economic development because there is rampant corruption and little morality in the ruling party which is affecting progress.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He challenged UNZA students to assist in restoring good governance and to fight injustice of any kind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And University of Zambia Student's Union (UNZASU) presidential aspirant, Brian Yuyi, took the occasion to condemn UNZA administration officials, who were present at the meeting, for allowing MMD cadres to form a branch at the institution, saying it was not healthy for the university.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yuyi, greeted with applause from the audience, challenged Dean of Students, Bizwell Phiri, and UNZA registrar, Peter Mphande, to state the administration's position on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From the time the cadres announced the formation of an MMD branch here, the administration has been quiet,&quot; Yuyi observed, asking Phiri and Mphande: &quot; Can we know why there has been this silence now?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yuyi accused the administration of being indecisive and of supporting the pro-MMD students and lecturers who in June marched to State House in support of the despised constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo said the students would resist any efforts to form a political party at the campus because it was supposed to be a non-partisan institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phiri and Mpande exculpated themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When I heard about the formation of the branch here, I immediately telephoned the registrar, the vice-chancellor and the students union to find out what was happening,&quot; Phiri said. &quot;The administration will take a decision in consultation with the students union.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students shouted down the two officials and demanded that the culprit lecturers and students be expelled or the &quot;Burning Youth&quot; (the students who last June burnt the property of their colleagues who had marched to State House in support of the Chiluba sponsored constitution) pounces on them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And UNZASU president, Emmanuel Tembo, has sued the state over his &quot; abduction&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His lawyer, Law Association of Zambia chairman, George Kunda, confirmed the suit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo is suing for damages, &quot;false imprisonment, inhuman treatment and intimidation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have already written the letter of demand to the state. The writ of summons was filed in the Ndola High Court yesterday,&quot; Kunda said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo said he was on July 15 dragged and taken behind UNZA hostels where a policeman pointed a gun at him threatening to shoot him if he did not cooperate. At the time of his &quot;abduction&quot; he did not know who had taken him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was taken to Chelstone Police Station where he spent the night in cells and was later moved to Lusaka Central Police for interrogation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I refused to answer questions at Central Police because of the way I was treated. I was not prepared to say anything ,&quot; Tembo said in an interview on July 16 after he was released without being charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo blamed his abduction on the 15 pro-MMD students who had marched to State House and feared that they may endanger the lives of many other fellow students.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Lusaka Province Chairman for Movement for Multi-Party Democracy, Christopher Chawinga, has challenged the University of Zambia administration to ban the United National Independence Party branch which also exists at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to press reports that the administration has banned his party's branch which he launched on Saturday, Mr Chawinga said he was aware that a UNIP branch existed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this is why Dr Kenneth Kaunda is always addressing meetings at the campus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chawinga also accussed the administration of maintaining double standards saying while they allowed UNIP activities to be conducted at the campus, they were so much against the MMD activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Kaunda goes to address students at the campus, the lecturers are silent but when MMD forms a branch they cry foul,&quot; Mr Chawinga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also cited a recent incident in which some MMD students had their property burnt by UNIP activists and the administration did not take any action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are aware that some senior lecturers are pro-UNIP and I challenge them to come in the open.,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged the students to remain calm adding that MMD will always support them despite the ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Saturday Mr Chawinga launced an MMD branch for the university at Chainama Hills Hotel to which the UNZA administartion is against.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Students at the University of Zambia (UNZA) Great East Road campus have given the authorities there up to today evening to explain their stand on the reported existance of an MMD branch at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimatum was issued yesterday evening when students stormed the office of the dean of students to seek an explanation why they maintained double stands by condenming political involvement of UNZA staff and students while at the same time allowing the formation of a political party at the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the institution revealed that some members of the administration were almost manhandled by the irate students over the saga yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The community relations manager, Mulife Malambo, declined to comment on the matter and refered all queries to the registrar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Malambo said the administration was still holding consultative meetings at high level after which a statement will be issued on the situation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The prices of local maize will remain stable between now and December when the major commercial producersare expected to off-load their harvest on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ACE) predicts that the maize prices will be pegged between K18,000 and K20,000 per 90 kilogram bag in December because by then all the maize from the small traders will have been consumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACE General Manager Andrew Fletcher said in Lusaka today the current maize market is characterised by low liquidity, limited buyers and lots of sellers because of the bumper harvest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Fletcher said there is a lot of maize available on the market mostly coming in from the smaller farmers although some of them are not prepared to sell it at the prevailing warehouse prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The current maize prices are pegged between K11,000 and K13,000 depending on the terms being offered by the market players and this trend is expected to go on until December when the stocks for the small growers run-out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Fletcher said the highest price prediction for this year's harvest is K25,000 and that this is also expected to compete favourably with the maize coming-in from neighbouring Zimbabwe between January and the next harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prices will move-upward depending on the flow of maize from the high consumption areas like Lusaka. More maize is expected to come on the market by October to supplement the supply by the small farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Fletcher said there is still a lot of maize being collected in rural areas and that the commodity exchange is busy buying on cash basis from the farmers willing to sell at the prevailing warehouse prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also pointed-out that the slow mealie_meal sales have contributed to low liquidity on the maize market because millers are only buying enough maize to produce mealie-meal at the current demand levels.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's star athlete Samuel Matete won't be rewarded yet as the government is still waiting for a report on his performance at the Atlanta Olympics.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to queries on whether or not the sports ministry would award Matete following his outstanding performance at the just-ended Olympic Games in Atlanta, permanent secretary Arthur Yoyo said it was the prerogative of the President, Frederick Chiluba to decide on the awards to give out to deserving sportsmen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I wish to advise that my ministry has not yet received a full report on the performance of not only Samuel Matete but the entire Zambian team that participated at the recent Olympics in the USA,&quot; reads part of Yoyo's response.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the decision to await a performance report from the Zambia Olympics Commonwealth and All Africa Games Association (ZOCAGA) has been attacked by some sports administrators who feel Matete deserves some rewards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is rather surprising that Matete cannot be rewarded for his job when we all know that he is the only one that managed to win a medal for this country.  I do not think there is any need to await any reports,&quot; said an administrator who sought anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Yoyo, even the issuing of the diplomatic passport to Zambia national soccer team skipper, Kalusha Bwalya, did not come from the sports ministry but State House.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will be too early for me to start commenting on rewards and awards for every sportsman that excels like Matete. You might recall that the diplomatic passport issued to Kalusha Bwalya was the prerogative of the Republican president and not my ministry. I would therefore advise you to wait until I receive that report from ZOCAGA,&quot; said Yoyo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And efforts to get comments from the Zambia Amatuer Athletics Association (ZAAA) failed as the general secretary, Phiri Kuombela was out of office.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saudi-based players not named at yesterday's press conference are Harrison Chongo and Elijah Litana. &quot;This is not the final squad, their stay in the team will depend on their performance in the camp and at club level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can still ask some players to leave the camp and bring new ones,&quot; Poulsen said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The squad will be training every Monday to Wednesday until the game against Mozambique on October 6. The coach asked Lusaka based players to assembly at Anchor House for transport to Kitwe.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Effective as of July 8, 1996, Ethiopians returning home from abroad are allowed to bring in goods considered as personal effects duty-free</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What types of Ethiopian returnees are going to benefit from the tax exemption? Included in the tax privilege category are Ethiopians serving in the Ethiopian diplomatic missions and embassies abroad; those on foreign scholarships and on business trips abroad and returning Ethiopian refugees.  So, on the face of it, that sounds like practically every Ethiopian who is coming back home after a stay abroad of some duration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the duration of the stay is important. However, it has not yet been made explicit. Would Ethiopians who have been abroad for a week be allowed to take advantage of the tax break? Further, the types of goods to receive the tax exemption have not yet been specified. Are cars, TV sets, tape-recorders, video-recorders, refrigerators and washing machines included? Definitely a tax exemption on second-hand cars (these being the ones that are most affordable by aspirants of car ownership) is a big bonus, amounting to as much as 15,000 birr for a medium-sized car with a manufacturing date in the mid-1980's. Another question is whether Ethiopians can benefit from the tax relief as frequently as they have been abroad. In other words, would someone who has been abroad three times in a year be allowed to bring in three cars duty free?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At any rate, scholarships and tours abroad on government business for state employees are going to be at a higher premium than before, thanks to the tax exemption privilege! Competition for such travel abroad among civil servants is expected to be stiff. High-ranking government officials may reserve such travel opportunities for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they do pass them on to subordinates, they may use them as a means of dispensing favors to gain or maintain political loyalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The timing of the announcement of the special tax exemption privilege to coincide with the ban on franco valuta imports, particularly by the private sector, appears to have been designed at least as a partial antidote to the anticipated widespread uproar over the latter measure. Whether the project will succeed remains to be seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least in principle, the government could use the duty-free privilege as an interim incentive to induce professionals to remain in the civil service where low pay is forcing experienced employees to seek work in the higher- paying private sector. Such labour market pressures have already motivated state-owned banks to consider granting substantial pay increments to their staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In this vein, to make the incentive impact of the tax break well felt, it is recommended that the following specifics be considered in its implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Include the major desirable items such as cars, TV sets, video-recorders and refrigerators in the list of goods to be allowed in duty-free;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Make the required duration of stay abroad for eligibility as short as possible;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Allow at least three occasions before a returnee's duty-free privilege is withdrawn;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Permit the sale of items brought in under the tax exemption privilege;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* See to it that scholarships and other travel opportunities are granted to deserving and appropriate individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one ought not to have the impression that the duty-free privilege is going to be anything like a substitute for an upward revision of the salary scale for the civil service. Revisions so far made are not adequate and even those are not being implemented. The government would be well- advised to appreciate that once the private sector is allowed to take off by removing the investment obstacles that bedevil it at present, the civil service may find it difficult to retain even a single top-notch technocrat outside the inner circle of political loyalists. As a whole, the recently announced duty-free privilege for returning Ethiopians is a welcome measure provided it is implemented equitably. However, one should not labour under the delusion that it would in any way ameliorate the unpopularity of the ban on franco valuta imports announced almost simultaneously. People are bound to ask: &quot;Why should we in Ethiopia be denied the right of receiving bona fide gifts of second-hand cars from our friends and relatives living abroad while returning Ethiopians are allowed to bring in such gifts duty-free. What's more, we pay taxes on the gifts we receive!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humorists may retort: &quot;If the gifts cannot come to you, go to them!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - First Direct Shipment of Ethiopian Coffee Destined for South Africa: The first direct shipment of Ethiopian coffee to South Africa is being loaded in Assab. The coffee is destined for Johannesburg via Durban and is being imported by a South African coffee roaster, caf Rossini. According to S.A. Bagersh Coffee, the company who is exporting the coffee to South Africa, this first containerized shipment weights in at 17,100 kg. Ethiopian coffee was in the past imported from European trading houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ajay Bramdeo, a First Secretary at the South African Embassy in Addis Ababa responsible for trade matters, said that this first coffee shipment is significant as it is symbolic of the ever increasing bilateral trade between Ethiopia and South Africa. He indicated that trade between the two countries had already grown from approximately US$ 3 million in 1993 to US$ 19 million in 1995 and is steadily increasing</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday at 7:10 p.m. a bomb blast at the Wabe Shebelle Hotel in Addis killed, according to the Region 14 Police Commisioner, one person and injured eleven others. Those injured were taken to Zewditu hospital, Black Lion, and one to Gebrial Hospital. ENA reported that there was only minor property damage. Frequent efforts made by Addis Tribune have failed to discover who is in charge of the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is the third incident of its kind this year. The first was at the Ghion Hotel in Addis on 18 January. The other was at the Ras Hotel in Dire Dawa on 2 February. It is not known whether a link exists between the latest bombing and the two previous ones or even between it and the assassination attempt on the life of Dr. Abdulmejid Hussein, Minister of Transport and Communications on 8 July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian Airline's Financial Troubles</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The financial situation of Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) has received much coverage of late. In a report in the biweekly newsletter, dated August 2, more is added to the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Net profit before tax during the first ten months of EAL's fiscal year, fell by 71.5 per cent to 42.6 million birr, down from 150 million last year.  Profits for March were 5.8 million birr compared with six million in the same month last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These figures were allegedly obtained from the Airlines internal financial document, known as the 'green book', said the article's writer, Tamene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reasons for the loss vary, the report continues. Many believe the 1995 net profit exaggerates its current loss. The airline posted 186 million birr profit last year, some find this unattainable. The management's competency and its failure to control costs was another reason mentioned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are indications that EAL's Chief, Dr. Ahmed may step aside and run the new Harari Bank, the report states. In addition to this, the Amharic publication, Tobia, claims that the Internal Revenue have asked Ethiopian Airlines to pay taxes owing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Tribune contacted EAL to see if there was any comment to the reports but our call was not returned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Food Security Assessment For June</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heavy rains continued in most agricultural areas of the country throughout June as the 'belg' season progresses. Last month the USAID Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), and the EU Food Security Unit (EU-FSU) estimated that this could be one of the best 'belg' production harvests in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An assessment team visited the field and preliminary findings confirm the previous forecast.The short 'meher' rainy season agricultural activities are underway around the country. They are reported to be following regular patterns and substantial rainfall in some regions has radically improved water and pasture availability, ensuring that there will be more than enough for the coming dry season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Citizens Permitted Use Of Wide Range Of Communication Equipment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry of Transport and Communications issued a statement indicating that Ethiopians can now import and use communication equipment including Television Receive Only (TVRO). The new law went into effect on Wednesday 7 August. ENA reported that telephone apparatus, cellular telephones, fax machines, modems and intercoms could also be imported by individuals and organizations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was however said that using TVRO for commercial purposes is prohibited.  The ministry also warned that legal action would be taken against those who without due authorization redistribute a program and receive authorized schedules, move the TVRO from one place to another. Those with licenses could sell and maintain telephone apparatus, cellular telephone, fax machine, data modems and intercom. ENA also reported that in two months time, the internet service might be made available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC Is Acting With Discretion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response to three articles appearing in a private newspaper on 23 and 30 July 1996, and on 6 August 1996, and subsequently reprinted in an English language weekly publication, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Delegation in Ethiopia would like to clarify the following points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC is a neutral, impartial and independent humanitarian organization, born more than one hundred years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As custodian of International Humanitarian Law, the ICRC has been mandated by the international community to monitor respect of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their two Additional Protocols of 1977.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, and through different tasks, ICRC delegates in Ethiopia visit detainees held in connection with the change of regime or for state security reasons throughout the country, including military camps, police stations, and government prisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During and after visits, the ICRC endeavors to obtain commitments from authorities concerned to improve conditions of detention, in particular to assume greater responsibility for the health of detainees, and, where necessary, to ensure that they are afforded correct treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports drawn up by the ICRC following visits to places of detention are confidential, and, as such, they are handed over to the detaining authorities only. This policy of discretion is not always properly understood by the public, which would often prefer to see the ICRC point an accusing finger at certain governments or at the perpetrators of certain inhuman acts.  Yet, over a century of experience has convinced the ICRC that its humanitarian mission is best accomplished through persuasion devoid of all publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These considerations do not prevent the ICRC from providing regular information to all those who wish to keep up to date on the institution's activities, but this information is limited to a description of the work carried out by the ICRC, and refrains from revealing what its delegates see or find out in the course of their duty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ICRC Delegation in Ethiopia hopes that the above-mentioned classifications will eradicate any misunderstanding which could have arisen on the part of those who might have read the articles referring to the ICRC, published in the last three issues of Urji. The first article was written solely on the basis of the personal interpretation of a reporter unknown to the ICRC, who, moreover, has never met with ICRC representatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copperbelt Deputy Minister, Charles Museba, said today that Zairean authorities have finally responded to reminders for them to host the 17th session of the Zambia-Zaire joint permanent commission meeting and they indicated that it could be held between now and next month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Museba said the Zambian side, however, would like the meeting to take place in the last week of this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was originally scheduled to take place in the first quarter of this year but Zairean authorities were not ready to host the talks at that time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian side has been anxious to meet the Zaireans to iron out a number of pressing issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the issues which the Zambian side is likely to table for discussion is the harrassment of Zambian travelers on the 'pedicle road' and the armed theft of vehicles which are later driven into Zaire.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Minister of Youth, Sport and Child Development Reverend Peter Chintala said in Lusaka today that FAZ must try to raise the money needed to cover the three national soccer teams involved in the World, Africa and CAF cup competitions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is very critical as government has no money, hence FAZ must engage in various fundraising ventures to raise the required amount,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev Chintala, however, disclosed that with the availability of funds, government would meet the shortfall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are prepared as a government to meet the shortfall if we raise a bit of money, but we can't help them all the way,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FAZ Treasurer Musa Kasonka announced in Lusaka that the association is short of the amount by almost three quaters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said FAZ needs money for the players' allowances, training and camping allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasonka further disclosed that his association would source funds from government, private donors and through the government appointed fundraising committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an exclusive telephone interview yesterday the secretary general of the Mozambique Football Association (MFA), Anthony Karavano said they have played a number of international games in preparation for the game against Zambia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karavano said they had also received an invitation from the South African Football Association (SAFA) to participate in the Four Nations tournament next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are looking forward to blotting Zambia's image, they are not invincible.  We want to prove that we are an upcoming soccer giant in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our participation in the Four Nation's Cup will be the final dress rehearsal before we take on Zambia in October,&quot; Karavano said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said their Portugal born coach, Arnado Salvador has assembled a crack squad which would shock Zambia in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Karavano said they would recall four of their internationals who are pursuing their career in Portugal. Among the players are the nimble-footed, Matthews &quot;Chaka Chaka&quot; Mandlazi who is playing for Stabudal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mozambique were booted out in the early rounds of the Africa Nation's Cup which was eventually won by the hosts, South Africa early this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Zambian national soccer coach, Roald Poulsen has indicated that he would need a full house of the professional players for the game against Mozambique.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The minimum share price in the Zambia Sugar PLC floatation is too high, carped Securities and Exchange Commission chief executive, Mumba Kapumpa, yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a seminar for curriculum developers at Lusaka's Hotel Intercontinental yesterday, Kapumpa said &quot;the price of K11 per share is alright, but the required block minimum amount of 10,000 shares is too much.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fifty or K60,000 block minimum would have been better because it would have allowed more people to participate in the floatation,&quot; Kapumpa suggested.  &quot;Our aim right now is to get as many people as possible to participate in the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mumba said he had anticipated more players on the Stock Exchange market with the floatation of Zambia Sugar but the block minimum amount would ensure only a few Zambians' participation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And representative from InterAfrica Equities and Securities Limited, Zoran Zuze, said the price of Zambia Sugar shares was too high in relation to what people can afford to pay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The average Zambian salary is K390,000 annually. When you take this into consideration, K110,000 minimum block share is too much for the ordinary Zambians,&quot; Zuze said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambia Sugar PLC price was set by the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seminar was for the Schools Education Project on Capital Markets. And the Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) will try to integrate the subject in school syllabuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SEC chairman Brian Musonda said the seminar was specifically aimed at the CDC trainers so that information about the stock exchange would be disseminated in schools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This forum is crucial because the more children and adults we can reach through you, the more people we will have interested enough in the market to participate,&quot; he told the trainers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - For the second time yesterday the state could not come up with the correct charge under the State Security Act against three Post editors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka High Court justice Peter Chitengi had to intervene and guide the prosecution to rephrase their charge and make it clearer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This charge was not properly drafted,&quot; Justice Chitengi told state advocate Emelia Phiri and Chalwe Muchenga. &quot;You were just fishing so that if they were missed by one charge they would be caught by another. That can put these people in jeopardy.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Justice Chitengi said this after Phiri applied to amend the charge from &quot; receiving document, article or information while knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe at the time that the same document, article or information were communicated or received in contravention of the State Security Act&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The people would like to amend the charges by way of deletion of the word document, article ... ,&quot; Phiri said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But justice Chitengi said the charge would still not be clear as it gave an impression that the state would want to catch the three on either &quot;being communicated to or if that fails receiving classified information&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These people are charged with a criminal offense and their liberty is at stake,&quot; justice Chitengi said. &quot; We can't say if we miss them on this charge we will catch them on this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And with justice Chitengi's help the state then dropped receiving and left the charge to read: &quot;receiving information while knowing or having reasonable ground to believe that the same was communicated in contravention of the State Security Act.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then the three accused persons, Post editor-in chief and managing director Fred M'membe, managing editor Bright Mwape and special projects editor Masautso Phiri, later took a plea of &quot;not guilty&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But earlier M'membe, who is representing himself, told justice Chitengi that he was shocked by the careless manner in which the state was handling such a serious case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;My lord, it is a bit shocking that a case of this nature can be handled in such a careless manner by the state. This case can alter the course of my professional, life and indeed my whole life. I can go to jail for up to 25 years,&quot; M'membe said. &quot;My job involves receiving information, seeking the views of other people, blending them and transmitting them everyday.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And when asked if he understood the charge against him to take a plea, M'membe said: &quot;I don't understand the charge because it has just been read to me now, I haven't had time to look at it. I have not been served with depositions. But from what has been read to me, I have great difficulties in understanding who should be charged - whether it is me or the government which should be here to answer charges.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">M'membe only took plea after justice Chitengi assured him of court's protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Mr M'membe you are protected. Feel safe,&quot; justice Chitengi assured. &quot;That is why I was raising the peculiarities in the charge, the role of the court is to ensure that even though you are representing yourself the state does no abuse your rights.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitengi then directed the state to make available depositions from the 21 state witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case comes up for trial on October 18, 29, 30 and 31, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia Breweries Plc yesterday launched new packaging for their Mosi lager. The company also announced changes in its management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A new chief executive, Roger Smith, has 'traded' places with former managing director, Mick Marriot, who takes up a similar position in Lesotho left by Smith.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am looking forward to the challenge that a competitive beer industry in Zambia will bring and will be relying on team effort from all staff members at Zambian Breweries,&quot; said Smith.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia Breweries distribution director, Morris McClurg, said the company had raised their marketing budget from K200 million to K500 million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Quality will always remain a prerequisite for us, not just in beer ingredients and brewing processes but also in marketing, sales, distribution, and interaction with all stakeholders,&quot; McClurg said. &quot;Our initial feedback two years ago was that our product quality was inconsistent and that our label for Mosi lager was outdated.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">McClurg, however, assured that &quot;the unacceptable standards of manufacture, hygiene, efficiency, and housekeeping of two years ago have all been done away with&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Over the past twelve months, Zambia Breweries had conducted an extensive market research through its agents,&quot; McClurg said. &quot;The results of this research is the new label and crown that you see.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Six hundred million kwacha of government funds have been spent on the poor and the marginalised every year since 1992, disclosed President Frederick Chiluba in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the Extensions to the Mother Theresa Home for the Terminally ill in Mtendere yesterday, President Chiluba said through the Public Welfare Assistance Scheme, aimed at cushioning them from the impact of the economic policies, the government has spent K600 million annually on the poor and the marginalised.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The poor are always with us, and it is up to us to take care of them. Most of us may not find the time nor inclination to care for the destitute, and we are grateful to the Missionaries of Charity for the good they are doing for the people,&quot; President Chiluba said. &quot;Mother Theresa was an epitome of humility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President disclosed that the government was also in the process of establishing a vulnerability criteria to assess eligibility in accessing Public Welfare resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mother Theresa's representative, Sister Regina, asked President Chiluba to help them in the matter of import duties and taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Home had no home to pay these charges,&quot; Sister Regina told the President. &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Benefactors were ready to help them with food, medicine and clothing but they could not afford to pay the import duty.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sister Regina also said the Home for Malnourished Children in Zambia has 60 children at the moment and the Outdoor Clinic which opens once a week caters for 220 patients on average.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our home for the terminally ill was started in a shed in January 1995 from that day till today 594 were admitted, 335 discharged, 140 died,&quot; Sister Regina disclosed to President Chiluba. &quot;At present we have 38 patients. In addition to these activities, we visit poor families and help them in their needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia National Farmers Union (ZNFU) executive director, George Gray, on Tuesday said his organisation would encourage its members to concentrate on profitable crops such as tobacco, as the maize prices had continued to fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's sad that the prices are still low and they continue to be falling, which will make repayment of loans very difficult,&quot; Gray said in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to the latest week's figures from the Agricultural Commodity Exchange (ACE) maize was trading at K12,500 per 90 kg bag.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACE, however, forecasts the same price to continue due to limited liquidity on the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And despite having close to six million bags in its hands, the Food Reserve Agency (FRA) has disclosed that the grain bag shortage is still being experienced in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FRA director, Chance Kabaghe, disclosed that there was a deficit of close to over five million bags needed for this years anticipated 15.6 million bag harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a substantial shortage of grain bags in the country. In addition to the two million bags carry overs we got from last year's stock, we imported about three million for the strategic grain reserves,&quot; Kabaghe said in an interview last Thursday adding: &quot;With the current stock in the private sector we have about 8-10 million bags in the country which means there is a shortfall of five million plus bags.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kabaghe however hailed private institutions which had taken the initiative of joining in grain bag trading as they are working in line with the liberalisation of the agro-sector by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the grain bag traders' concentration on urban areas in distribution of the currently scarce empty grain bags has created shortages in the rural areas in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the agricultural ministry's Bullentin, traders have concentrated their distribution of grain bags in the urban areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are, however, pronounced shortages of bags in rural areas. Most of the available bags are concentrated in urban areas,&quot; the report said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The distribution has further been affected by the generally tight liquidity on the market and the prices of the bags which the farmers feel is rather high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Grain traders have limited funds to pay for empty grain bags let alone the maize itself, very few small scale farmers can afford the bags,&quot; the bulletin further explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same view was shared by the Peasant Farmers Union of Zambia chairman, Patrick Kayeka, who disclosed that the K2,000 average price at which traders were selling the empty grain bags was too high.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The farmers have obligations such as the clearing of their farming loans and in addition to that, have to pay very high prices for grain bags while the maize prices are still low,&quot; Kayeka said in an interview last Saturday. &quot; Most of them simply cannot afford.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Second Criminal Bench of the Federal High Court will re- commence hearing the case against Dr. Taye Woldesemayat, President of the Ethiopian Teachers' Association (ETA), on 14 October. Five others also stand accused of allegedly forming an illegal underground organization presumably under the name &quot;Ethiopian National Patriots Front&quot;. The other five were named by the government English daily newspaper the Ethiopian Herald as Ato Kebede Desta, former president of the Veteran Teachers' Association, Ato Gebretsadik Hailemariam, Lt. Chane Tolla, Ato Talegeta Leul (Dagne), and Captain Moges Assefa. Ato Seleshi Berhane, cited in the statement issued by the Police Force Central Bureau's Investigation Co-ordination department, as one of the organisers of the underground organisation was not among the defendants.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Monday 5 August, the six defendants heard the charges brought against them. All of them decided to consult with their lawyers before making any comments. A reporter from a government newspaper noted that the ETA president objected to the presence of a press camera crew at the hearing. It was said that Dr. Taye took his coat and covered his face and only put it on again after the court ordered him to. The six defendants were appealed for the court to grant them bail. The Prosecutor General objected to this by saying that the defendants were charged with grave offences that call for sever punishments, and so there was all likelihood of them jumping bail. The granting of bail, said the Prosecutor General, &quot; Will almost certainly mean the elimination or attempted persuasion by the defendants and their collaborators of the witnesses&quot;. On Tuesday, the court denied all six of the defendants bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Taye Woldesemayat was arrested on 30 May 1996, at the Bole International Airport on his return from a working visit of Europe. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council has issued a report noting dissatisfaction with the way Dr. Taye was being treated in prison and called for his case to be handled &quot; in accordance with the law&quot;. On 26 June 1996, the executive committee of ETA held a press conference where they said that &quot;Atrocities committed against ETA members have reached a dangerous point&quot;. The committee called the accusation put forward against its president as &quot; Nothing more than an attempt to poison public opinion against ETA and to divert attention from the grievances of Ethiopian teachers which is beginning to arouse national and international interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Chiluba says Zambia needs to make concerted efforts to improve the sporting arena in order to tap more talent that will compete with confidence at international games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiluba said when he opened the Zambia Sports Development Centre and the vision sports for all conference in Luska today that well organised sport can also play an important role in facilitating Zambia's relations abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said because sport cuts across all forms of barriers between nations, it is therefore an important vehicle in society for conveying positive images and cultural practices for a nation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president said on the economic front, sport contributes to the productivity of the nation directly through the production, sale or export of sporting equipment, material, expertise and also indirectly by enhancing the physical fitness of the active labour force in industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry of youth, sport and child development has acquired the former Zambia Industrial and Marketing Corporation (ZIMCO) sports complex to facilitate sport improvement in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The complex will now be called Zambia Sports Development Complex and will remain open to members of the public, institutions and sports team for training and clinic sessions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The president also observed that a fit nation greatly reduces its medical expenditure because it is less prone to simple ailments as a result of physical fitness which he said is only possible through participation in sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking earlier, Sports Minister Samuel Miyanda said his ministry will move alongside the national sports policy to improve sport in both the rural and urban parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miyanda said the vision sports for all conference will also be spread to other parts of the country and appealed for government support in financing sports programmes across the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Miyanda said although Zambia's performance at the just ended 1996 olympics is commendable, a lot more still needs to be done to tap the talent that is lying around in the sports arena of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He appealed to the president to consider giving a diplomatic passport to 400 metres champion Samuel Matete who won Zambia the first ever silver medal at the olympics.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) continues to contribute to the socio-economic development of Zambia and Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian Transport and Communications Permanent Secretary, Ronald Mukuma, said last night at a reception to mark 20 years of TAZARA operations that the authority was now being recognised as an important transport corridor for both Preferential Trade Area and Southern African Development Community member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is on SADC programmes and is being improved in order to extend services to all South and Central African states,&quot; said Mr Mukuma.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said TAZARA was an important transport corridor for the neighbouring countries such as Zaire, Malawi and Zimbabwe and that it symbolised continued friendship and cooperation among states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The recent political changes in South Africa which led to the opening up of trade routes that were closed when the trade sanctions against that country were still in force have however led to the decline in traffic performance of TAZARA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mukuma also attributed the decline in the volume of exports for Zambia and Tanzania to a decline in economic growth in the two countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the two governments had improved their road infrastructure which favoured road hauliers at the expense of the railways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to reduce the negative trends TAZARA had commercialised its operations by installing a gantry crane for loading and offloading of cargo and Kapiri Mposhi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authority is also engaging road transporters to ferry goods to the new Kapiri Mposhi crane as well as restructuring its tariffs so as to make them more competitive with other routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Secutiry of cargo has also been improved with armed government policemen escorting all trains from Kapiri to Dar-es-Salaam to ensure safety of cargo for clients.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Mukuma paid tribute to the Chinese government for the construction of the railway line and their continued technical and material support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinese Ambassador to Zambia Yang Zengye said at the same function that his government cherished the friendship that the construction of the railways had brought over the past 20 years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Project manager, Jocoba Wasselick, said in Solwezi today that the donor would spend K3.8 billion on the third phase which comes to an end in 1999.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wasselick said that the Zambian government is expected to pump in K300 million as counterpart funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the project would construct a total of 224 new wells in mwinilunga and solwezi districts respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third phase excludes Kasempa whose project was handed over to the district council last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Wasselick said that the project will also improve a total of 56 traditional water sources in the project area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that communities which do not qualify for new wells would be given well covers and windlasses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the project was also involved in digging wells in the Solwezi east constituency mainly along the Solwezi/Chingola highway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the project was using two drama groups to entertain and train local communities on how to maintain water wells.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the community response was encouraging as villagers were willing to take up their own responsibilities of looking after the wells.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Gay rights are human rights, say homosexual activists in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No, homosexuals have no right to &quot;denigrate and erode our cultural values,&quot; counters the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe, a largely heterosexual nation of 10.5 million, faced a test of tolerance recently when the Gays and Lesbians Association (GALZ) succeeded in their year-long campaign to be included in the prestigious annual international book fair held in the Zimbabwean capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe had, from 1995, led the chorus against homosexuality, saying Zimbabwe would never allow &quot;sodomists and sexual perverts&quot; to freely engage in what he termed their deviant behavior.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GALZ had planned to exhibit at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) in July 1995 but the government imposed a ban on them that triggered condemnation and demonstrations against Mugabe by gays, lesbians and their sympathizers when he visited South Africa and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So, when organizers of the 1996 ZIBF allowed GALZ to participate at the week-long event in the capital, HARARE, the government moved in swiftly to re- state its revulsion of homosexuality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government said GALZ was not only banned from exhibiting at the fair this year but also from any future book fairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ban on any GALZ exhibit was to protect and guarantee the &quot;cultural health&quot; of Zimbabwe, said the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor George Kahari, director of the national gallery of Zimbabwe and a board member of the ZIBF, said the GALZ exhibition could not be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We do not approve of this kind of freedom because that kind is against our culture and we want our people to adhere to the culture which does not allow people to behave the way homosexuals do,&quot; said Kahari.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, seemingly undeterred, GALZ said it would not be &quot;bullied&quot; into withdrawing from the book fair like it did in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is inhuman to continue this persecution of us,&quot; said GALZ spokesperson, Keith Goddard. &quot;homosexuals have the right to speak out and we will be heard.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A small group of artistes participating at the book fair then demonstrated at the fair venue denouncing homosexuality and they were joined by hundreds of members of the Christ Apostolic Church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evangelist Frederick Magaya came out with the basic logic that when God put man on earth he then created a woman but &quot;never created a man for a man.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Writing in one of the national dailies, Tobias Boka of Harare said it did not make sense biologically for a man-to-man or woman-to-woman sexual relationship to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Human rights are not exercised in a vacuum. They operate in a specific cultural context of a specific nation with specific values. Although culture may be dynamic, not everything is international,&quot; wrote Boka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A pressure group linked to the University of Zimbabwe threatened to disrupt the book fair and burn down the GALZ stand should they proceed with their exhibition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The board of censors, through its chairman, Herbert Malaba, invoked a section of the censorship and entertainments control act to legally bar GALZ from participating at the book fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But even that did not ruffle GALZ which then urgently sought a high court injunction nullifying the board of censors order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Arguing the state's case in the high court, a senior law officer in the attorney general's office said the Zimbabwean society was culturally anti- homosexual, considering it a perverted, disgusting and immoral practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, judge president Wilson Sandura ruled that the censorship board could not ban GALZ from establishing a stand at the book fair as this was not covered by the act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, he added, the material to be exhibited at the stand had not been presented or made known to the board of censors, so it had no basis to prohibit the exhibition or publications it had not seen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government appealed in the supreme court against judge Sandura's ruling but this did not stop GALZ from taking part in the book fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, instead of exercising their hard-won right, GALZ went on to mount an empty stand at the book fair, manned by just a handful of their members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For two straight days and until the book fair ended, GALZ shied away from exhibiting anything and just a wreath of flowers graced the table meant for their literature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">None of their members showed up at the stand most probably because they feared for their safety from some sections of society that had publicly promised mayhem against homosexuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As it turned out, GALZ may have won a legal battle to be allowed to exercise their constitutional right of freedom of expression, but they lost the courage to show off what makes them behave the way they do to the larger society that considers their sexual orientation morally, socially, culturally and spiritually decadent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - The National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECON) has announced an amendment to the guidelines for the registration political parties giving them until August 29 to complete any merger plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By the July 25 deadline, some 18 political associations had submitted applications to be registered as parties under the military regime's transition to democracy programme expected to end in October 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But apparently unable to meet the guidelines for registration, some of the political groups have resorted to merger plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing the extended deadline Thursday in Abuja, the federal capital, NECON chairman, Sumner Dagogo-Jack, said &quot;it is the political associations which, entirely on their own initiative, formulated the issue of merger and consequently wrote to the commission signifying their intention to merge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But he added that the development would not affect the transition programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the time-table, the July-September 1996 quarter is set aside for the registration of political parties, delineation of constituencies and production of voters' registers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dagogo-Jack said approved mergers of political parties would be announced by the electoral commission on August 30 and 31.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Verification of political association claims, suspended before the new deadline, will resume September 2 and last for two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some political associations considered some of the NECON guidelines too tough. One of them requires a prospective party to obtain 1.2 million card- carrying members in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the electoral commission has said the guidelines are to stem spurious claims and ensure that the parties are well represented across the country of 100 million people. Several Nigerian political parties have in the past sprung up along regional or tribal lines.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's information minister, Walter Ofonagoro, has urged African media to evolve ways of redressing the imbalance in the world information system dominated by the west.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present world information order, he said, &quot;engendered inequities in information systems and dissemination as seen in the one-way flow of information, often biased and distorted, and generally out of tune with the values and realities of developing countries.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This remark was contained in his address of welcome to the public presentation of a new book: North-South Information Culture, Trends in Global Communications and Research Paradigms, edited by prof. Luke Uka Uche, editor- in-chief of the Pan African News Agency, and the launching of the PANA Internet application (RAPIDE) in Lagos Thursday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The continued threat of the one-way flow of information in the post-cold war era, called for joint responsibility of the state and citizens to establish programmes for positive use of communication media within the framework of development policies and national realities,&quot; the minister said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He criticized the &quot;creation of reality&quot; by the western media, which he accused of trying to &quot;alter the national cause of developing nations to self- reliance and independence, and to maintain a balance of power that was advantageous to them (the West).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to him, &quot;it is crucial for everyone to realize that the basic reason for the one-way flow of information is to ensure the activities of imperialism in politics, and economic fields as well as, ideological domination over the peoples of the developing world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister, represented at the occasion by Moses Ekpo, Nigerian Copyright Council director-general, said the so-called new world information order &quot; presents the increasing role communication plays in creating the kind of international climate which can promote or inhibit the realization of peace, war and national development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reviewing the 334-page book, Florence Nwachukwu of the University of Lagos Department of Mass Communication, said it would serve as an important guide at redressing the information imbalance between the north and south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The PANA coordinator-general, Babacar Fall, told the audience, which included several government officials, scholars and diplomats, that 'RAPIDE', an Internet application, had been developed by the Dakar-based continental wire service to stimulate the supply of information for African integration and development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the system was one of the cheapest means of communication linking the continent with the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PANA's technical team was able to link Nigeria to the system through the Airline Telecommunication and Information Services (SITA) office in Lagos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fall said through the application, the African press would be &quot;visible with international connectivity.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other benefits of the system, which has been demonstrated in a number of African countries, include promotion of communication, tourism, culture and education on the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Southern African is expected to become a free trade area within the next eight years, South African trade and industry minister, Alec Erwin, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that an agreement in principle to this effect had been reached by the 12-member Southern African Development Community (SADC).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As members of a free trade area, the countries concerned will no longer have import tariffs and quotas, export subsidies and other individual government stipulations aimed at controlling trade between them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the standing committee on trade and industry in Cape Town Thursday, Erwin said such a southern African free trade area could be expected to improve trade between the various member countries, and to steer the region in the direction of higher economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that although a deadline of eight years had been agreed to in principle, it would still be subject to the signing of a relevant trade protocol. A time-table for the elimination of existing tariffs between SADC member countries would then have to be finalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protocol would be discussed at the forthcoming SADC meeting in Maseru, Lesotho, next week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are comfortable with the eight-year deadline, but other countries in the region may need more time to adjust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If others do not insist on a longer deadline, South Africa certainly will not,&quot; said Erwin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing an African steel conference here, South African trade and industry minister Alec Erwin said that his department had identified a total of 135 projects associated with the corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The projects -- in South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe -- could begin within five to six years and would require an investment of more than 1.1 billion dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin added that most of the funding for the projects would come from public and private sector partnerships. The aid component would be mainly for the upgrading of Maputo harbour, and would amount to some 35 million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of private and public sector commitment to the project, the minister said, would open a new era in cross-border co-operation and development in southern Africa, after years of dependency on foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Maputo development corridor promotion company is to be established within the next two months. A protocol providing for the establishment of the company was signed in July by Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Botswana, Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He urged African governments to commit themselves to macro-economic strategies such as the Maputo development corridor to attract investment for growth and development of the continent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Zambia has become the latest country to imposed sanctions on Burundi to press for the return of the legitimate civilian government overthrown by the military regime of Maj. Pierre Buyoya on July 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's foreign affairs minister, Gen. Christon Tembo, said that Zambia had decided to temporarily sever all contacts with Burundi, including water, air and land communication.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia is committed to the principle that changes of government should be done in accordance with accepted norms of international conduct and legality.  We, therefore, do not recognize the regime of major Pierre Buyoya which has been imposed on the people of Burundi through military coup,&quot; Tembo said at a briefing in Lusaka Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The action comes after other east and central African countries had taken similar measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tembo said Zambia would cooperate with the countries of the great lakes region, the Organization of African Unity and the United Nations in efforts to reinstate constitutional rule in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had discussions with the ministers of commerce, trade and industry, and communications and transport to ensure local companies with export deals with Burundi were not greatly inconvenienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Early this week, the privatized Zambia sugar company said it would lose about three million U.S. dollars in sugar exports to Burundi if it decides to impose sanctions. Zambia exports 9,000 tons of sugar annually to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company director, David Covell, said sanctions would make it difficult for Zambia to regain the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Chilanga cement, which was also recently privatized, said that it would lose one million dollars of export if economic sanctions were imposed. The company exports to Burundi an average of 15,000 tons every year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In the wake of Desmond Tutu's call for apartheid judges to come clean, the search for dubious judgments has unearthed an extraordinary case involving a clerk articled to Nelson Mandela and the late Oliver Tambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clerk was charged with contempt of court after sitting in the white lawyers' seats in court and refusing to move.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately for Tutu, the case took place in 1960.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boris Kaplan, of Krugersdorp attorneys' firm Van der Merwe Cronje &amp; Kaplan, this week alerted the M&amp;G to Rex v Pitje, heard by former chief justice Steyn and four other judges of the Appellate Division. The court rejected the clerk's appeal after he was fined u5, or five days' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The court held that his handling of the case would not have been hampered by being forced to sit in another seat, and that as lord of his courtroom, the magistrate was entitled to make the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tambo had previously withdrawn from the same case after the magistrate told him he would not be heard unless he moved to the &quot;European table&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - In stark contrast to reports of their imminent demise, Zimbabwe's tobacco growers appear to be flourishing. This year's flue-cured crop is expected to fetch Z$5,68-billion (R2,5-billion), slightly up on last year's record Z$5-billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This comes in the face of escalating costs, political flak, and a hefty state levy widely predicted at the time of its introduction in June to presage the collapse of the industry.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growth in world demand for tobacco and rigid adherence to quality standards have seen Zimbabwe's leaf maintaining its premier position on the world market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With 136-million kilograms of tobacco already sold from a crop totalling 203-million kilograms, prices are holding reasonably firm, said Brenda Mee of auctioneers Tobacco Sales Floor. But she adds: &quot;had it not been for a good crop the result could have been disastrous&quot;. The tobacco growers' umbrella body, the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA), is only too aware of the obstacles that lie ahead. This week the ZTA made submissions to Parliament calling for an investigation into how MPs came by forged documents used to vilify both the ZTA and agriculture minister Denis Norman. Several MPs had alleged the ZTA was &quot;thwarting indigenisation&quot; of the tobacco industry in league with former Rhodesian intelligence agents. Black empowerment advocate Roger Boka has accused tobacco growers of transfer pricing, a charge they deny. Boka has meanwhile formed his own association of tobacco merchants and has hired a Chinese company to construct a rival tobacco selling floor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZTA president Robert Webb saw President Robert Mugabe last month to appeal against the 10% levy which MPs insisted should fall equally on growers and merchants. Mugabe promised to reconsider if they could make a case showing a negative impact on the industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Webb believes he has a case. Prices are 12% down, he claims, and were it not for the levy, tobacco growers would be earning the country up to Z$7- billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, there are reports the world's largest tobacco manufacturer, Philip Morris, is developing cold feet about the reliability of the Zimbabwean product following the government's intervention. &quot;They probably see it as an involvement by government in a hitherto transparent auction system leading to a possible reduction in acreages,&quot; said Webb. &quot;They could see our tobacco becoming uncompetitive.&quot; Webb also believes foreign buyers are unimpressed by the attacks on Norman. &quot;Philip Morris is an extraordinarily good customer to Zimbabwe,&quot; observed Mee. &quot;They need to be constantly assured as to the stability of the market.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps the most influential protests have come from nearly 10 000 black small-scale tobacco farmers who have found the levy prohibitive. The ZTA points to its Farm Development Trust scheme as bringing small- scale farmers into a network hitherto dominated by affluent white growers whose conspicuous lifestyles have made them a target of a government desperate for revenue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia's stringent austerity measures have helped create a crisis in the sexual exploitation of children, with high numbers of under-age prostitutes roaming the streets, child advocacy groups say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The groups, taking stock for an international conference on the sexual exploitation of children this month in Sweden, said that the combination of deaths as a result of Aids and migration to the cities had in many cases disintegrated the traditional, extended family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The existence of 500 000 Aids orphans, coupled with the loss of tens of thousands of state jobs, free education and food subsidies during five years of a strict structural adjustment programme, means thousands of childrens have been forced to earn money on the streets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No one knows how many children are surviving by selling their bodies -- but local non-governmental organisations monitoring the situation agree the problem is worsening by the day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sexual exploitation of children is Zambia's silent problem. Poverty has gotten worse under the structural-adjustment programme and is actually contributing to the problem,&quot; said Scholastica Chinsense, deputy director of the government's Social Welfare Department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Merab Kiremire, board secretary of Tasintha, a local NGO working with prostitutes, added: &quot;They say prostitution is the oldest profession. Not here in Zambia. It's gotten far, far worse with the economic crisis over the past five years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Frederick Chiluba has been lauded by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for his sticking to austerity programme guidelines.  But for tens of thousands of families whose breadwinners have lost jobs in privatisations, the impact has meant misery and desperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Monica Shinganga, the national director for the Young Women's Christian Association HIV/Aids prevention Project, women's low status means families will often invest in boys' education but not girls'. It is up to girls, who are seen as mere commodities, to act as breadwinners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A typical story is told by Justine Kalandanya, whose decline began when she needed money to buy a school uniform after her father died. She was 12 years old and her mother sent her forth to find the money needed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within weeks she was walking the streets, selling her child-like body to men at bus stations. Now three years later, Kalandanya is raising her third child, the uniform long forgotten in a sordid chain of events which saw her become accustomed to sleeping with seven men a night and burying two other children that died of syphillis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An average trick costs the equivalent of about R1,15 without a condom and R2 with one. Sometimes Kalandanya just settles for food or a bus ticket.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'd do anything to get a nice job or go back to school,&quot; said Kalandanya, who looks closer to 10 than 15. &quot;But I can't.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&gt;From the shanty towns of the capital Lusaka to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">copperbelt mining route, girls as young as nine are servicing truckdrivers, fishmongers, miners, soldiers, tourists and vendors. Guardians often collude by turning a blind eye to where a child's proceeds are coming from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chinsense said that adding to the problem is the widespread myth that having sex with a young girl will cure Aids. This was encouraging HIV- infected men to seek ever-younger partners, including their own relatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An estimated 25 to 30% of Zambia's urban population is infected with HIV, according to the Health Ministry. HIV infection rates for females aged 15 to 19 years are seven times that of the males.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The impact on the population-growth rate is staggering. While in many African countries it is as high as 3%, in Zambia it is expected to soon decline to almost zero.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - A confidential United Nations report on the murder of Burundi's first Hutu president -- kept under wraps because of its potentially explosive impact on the conflict-ravaged country -- accuses the army high command of organising the assassination and of complicity in the subsequent slaughter of Hutu civilians by Tutsi soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the report does not directly name those responsible for the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye three years ago, it questions the actions of several officers, including the army chief of staff. The UN reaches no conclusion about the role of Burundi's past and present military head of state, Major Pierre Buyoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report also condemns Hutu leaders, accusing some of whipping up genocide against the Tutsi minority in the wake of the assassination, which started Burundi's civil war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya, who seized power three weeks ago, has declared that no one is above the law. Hutus have accused Burundi's Tutsi-dominated establishment of stalling its own inquiry into the assassination, while key witnesses have disappeared or died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN commission of inquiry into Ndadaye's killing completed its report last month, but it was swiftly secreted away. Only members of the UN Security Council have been permitted to read it, and then for only 30 minutes each.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In sections of the report, the UN inquiry focuses on two areas: the October 1993 coup and assassination of Ndadaye, who won Burundi's first free election four months earlier, and the massacres of an estimated 50 000 Hutus and Tutsis in the weeks after the murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian government has never denied soldiers were responsible for the assassination, but it has portrayed them as low-ranking renegades. The UN commission reaches a different conclusion. &quot;The assassination of President Ndadaye was planned beforehand as an integral part of the coup that overthrew him . ... and the planning and execution of the coup was carried out by officers highly placed in the line of command of Burundi's army,'' the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hutus, devastated at the loss of a man who held out the promise of an end to decades of oppression, turned on the Tutsi minority. Thousands were killed.  The UN commission says the army retaliated with considerable brutality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Indiscriminate killing of Hutu men, women and children was carried out by members of Burundi's army and the gendarmerie, and by Tutsi civilians.  Although no evidence was obtained to indicate that the repression was centrally planned or ordered, it is an established fact that no effort was made by the military authorities at any level of command to prevent, stop, investigate or punish such acts,&quot; it says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission concludes that organised killing was not one-sided. It says that after Ndadaye's assassination, members of the murdered president's party, Frodebu, spurred &quot;a genocide&quot; of the Tutsi minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The commission considers there is sufficient evidence that acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority took place in Burundi on 21 October 1993, with the participation of certain Frodebu functionaries and leaders up to commune level,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It concludes that senior Frodebu officials were expecting a coup, and prepared Hutus to resist it. But the UN commission says it has no evidence that the attempted genocide was organised from the top of Frodebu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the commission says it does not have enough evidence to accuse specific individuals of plotting the assassination, it is particularly damning towards the army chief of staff, Colonel Jean Bikomagu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report recounts actions by Bikomagu which suggest he had full knowledge of what was occurring. It notes that he failed to intervene as his soldiers assassinated the president, set up a ruling committee, and continued massacring Hutus even after the coup collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The committee was in control for three days and only reinstated civilian government when it failed to control the bloodbath throughout the country, in spite of the bloody repression by the army under Bikomagu's command, and had lost all hope of overcoming the adamant opposition of the international community,&quot; the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bikomagu, who remains in his command, declined an interview. But the head of military intelligence, Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwe, dismisses the UN report and defends the army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We're not learning anything new here. The assassination concerns individuals who are not the whole army.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">$200 000 in a Brussels bank account. Soon we will ... live in Europe forever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flavia carefully folds the diamond back into an envelope and scrambles up the riverbank with me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All of us here, we are drawn together ... We are all strangers to each other, sharing one dream: a stone that shines so bright, something that ends our hell here, something like a 35-carat fancy (a coloured diamond).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">We stand on a ridge, across a once-deep, green valley. Hundreds of men, long spades in their hands, dig in deep, square holes -- that look ominously like graves -- in search of the familiar gravel, from sunrise to sunset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the Luachimo river, wiry men work from flimsy, dugout canoes. They dive deep into turbulent waters, then, pushing the limits of their lungs, reappear, arms with buckets first, then heads. The muddy gravel is tipped into the canoes, where the men in the canoes fervently inspect it. The divers take a deep breath and plunge again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the riverbank, young men pan the day's gravel with care. They dance in the river, now low, but soon swollen and dangerous with early spring rain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flavia waves his hand and says, &quot;Over here we die - -- many of us from the disease brought by the rain, from the mud which buries us alive, from the guns of the soldiers of FAA (Forcas Armadas Angolanas, the government's army) and FALA (Forcas Armadas de Libertacao de Angola -- Unita's military wing).  One day we are left alone, the next, FAA arrives in helicopters asking no questions, just killing from the sky.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some men gather closer. One boasts: &quot;I've been on Angolan TV -- repenting my sins, admitting my guilt for being Zairean, for stealing Angolan diamonds.  Do you understand the meaning of the word 'garimpeiro'?&quot; His friends laugh and sing out loudly, &quot;garimpeiro!&quot; The sound echoes through the valley. &quot;Then I bought myself out of prison at Saurimo for $500. They nearly killed me, said I was supporting Unita (Uniaco Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola -- the main opposition).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Do you know how many hundreds of men, Zairean, Malian, Senegalese, Angolan miners have been killed here by the government and Unita?&quot; asks an old man who recently had all his possessions stolen by marauding Unita soldiers. &quot; During the day the soldiers hang around their camp getting fed by the United Nations, and at night they become monsters ... The United Nations feeds our killers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flavia mumbles, &quot;Here we don't argue, we just move on. As soon as we hear the land we are mining belongs to someone -- we get out and move on.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another garimpeiro says, &quot;All the generals of FAA and FALA now have their own concessions. Soon there will be nowhere to go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The men excitedly agree. They pick up their long spades and leave. &quot; Garimpeiro, garimpeiro&quot; they sing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outside the town thousands of workers, legitimately employed by a decade- old mining operation, toil with antiquated earthmoving equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company, SML (Sociedade Mineira do Lucapa), is a story of resourcefulness and endurance. The initial concessionaire was a mythical German, &quot;Hellinger&quot;. In the eighties, with Angola facing isolation from the West, and heavily under Eastern bloc influence, Hellinger created the Lucapa mine, and managed simultaneously a Movimento Popular de Libertacao de Angola (MPLA) government contract cleaning the streets of Luanda with Filipino workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The company has since changed hands. The mining operation has suffered heavily from the effects of the civil war. Fuel and food are flown in four times a day by jets which service the diamond fields under government control.  The company has lost 11 expatriates due to conflict and landmines.Andy Machim, the general manager of International Trading and Mining (ITM), which is contracted to SML, has lived and worked in Angola since 1982.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Here in Lucapa it's just hard work and slog. Every day is an endurance marathon. This is not South Africa. The people there must understand that all the odds here are stacked against you. There are no easy fortunes to be made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You need one helluva lot of capital,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infrastructure; it's high-risk mining. the security situation is incredibly fragile. We pay millions of dollars in tax to government and geological surveys and then find some young garimpeiros mining on the concession, cleaning the place out -- damaging, beyond excavation, potential mining sites.  They sell directly to diamond buyers: neither pay taxes nor contribute to the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machim earlier in the year lost two friends in a landmine incident on the mine's property, but refuses to comment on who could have caused their death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This is what happens here,&quot; complains an FAA senior officer, waiting to get out of the army, but unofficially already employed by some South African miners in Dundo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As soon as you hit the jackpot and the bad debts are over for good, then you die; ambushed or from a landmine. ... They see you on the road and wait for your return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He continues: &quot;The Lucapa diamonds are world-famous for their quality. We hear the Russians are filtering their cheap diamonds in to Lucapa in a bid to increase their price.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although fraught with danger, the dividends are now paying for South Africans who have worked in Angola for the past two years. Some operate joint ventures with Portuguese companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brian Atwell and his 34 South African divers, many of them ex-navy, mine on the Luachimo river. According to locals, the company has struck it lucky more than once, having allegedly found a 35- to 40- carat &quot;fancy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For other South African mining companies, mining in Angola has been a nightmare. Gert Potgieter, now back in White River, has little to show for his endeavours at Dundo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His one-time partner, Cicero Combrink from Vereeniging, is now heading back with a convoy of mining material, across Namibia, to Ngiva and from there to Saurimo, via Russian aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saurimo has been a pitstop, home and graveyard for many South Africans and Russians -- pilots, mercenaries and diamond hunters. It is now the supply base for several South African air freighters and traders. The big frame of ex-spy Craig Williamson, who supplies a diamond group, is often seen in the dusty town. Tom Robberts of Ramoco Air, a Lanseria outfit allegedly run by ex- National Intelligence Agency agents, often asks for clearance at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Why does Angola only lure the South African soldier, and white racist?&quot; asks a cop in Saurimo, casually frisking our car. &quot;Where are the ordinary farmers, plumbers and carpenters?&quot; He asks for a bribe; &quot;a coca-cola&quot;. I decline. He shouts and swears at me, &quot;you deserve no respect!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And what respect do the South Africans deserve?&quot; asks another man with dark rings under his eyes. He says he sells his parcels in Johannesburg, for rands and commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I deal with respectable-looking people, decent and honest, until I arrive with a parcel, then they turn nasty, greedy and dangerous. Nowadays, I sell my diamonds one by one in Johannesburg.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Department of Home Affairs still maintains a blacklist of &quot;undesirable&quot; visitors to South Africa -- currently about 3 000 people.  Now Deputy Minister Lindiwe Sisulu wants it reviewed after a prominent labour leader was barred entry at Johannesburg International Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu this week said she had to &quot;apologise profusely&quot; to British union official Roy Jones when he was detained at the airport for the better part of a day last month. She is planning to set up a review committee to expunge political inclusions and set strict rules on who may be blacklisted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The list, officially called a &quot;stoplist&quot;, first made headlines when it was discovered entertainer Frank Sinatra was on it -- supposedly because of his &quot; mafia&quot; links -- when he wanted to visit South Africa for the 1981 opening of the Sun City Superbowl. His name was removed and he performed at the opening ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu said when Jones arrived with an International Labour Organisation delegation last month he was detained by immigration officials. Three hours after his arrival, she was called to deal with it. &quot;I contacted my department ... They said he had been put on the list in 1984. Then I knew it was nonsense.&quot; Another three hours later, on her instructions, Jones was allowed entry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the main item she found in a Home Affairs file on Jones was a clipping from the Star newspaper, dated 1984, on his support in an Orange Free State miners' strike of Cyril Ramaphosa, then- secretary general of the National Union of Mineworkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu, who was appointed home affairs deputy minister at the end of June, subsequently found the same fate had befallen an African National Congress cadre, Alex Mombaris -- who escaped from prison and fled the country after he was jailed in the 1970s for sabotage -- when he tried to return to South Africa recently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We'll never know how many others had to be rescued from the airports.  These are the two we know about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu's queries with Home Affairs officials led her to discover the stoplist had numbered as many as 18 000 towards the end of the 1980s -- and that it included Michael Jackson at one stage. When the way had to be cleared for exiles to return to South Africa as a result of the post-1990 negotiations, Home Affairs and the police and intelligence services embarked on a review. The stoplist was honed down to about 3 000 before the 1994 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But she said she was still not happy with the inherited list. &quot;People could be put on the stoplist merely for attracting bad publicity and that is why I want a committee to review it ... It took so much money, such an elaborate system to keep apartheid going. It is still going to cost us money to dismantle it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu said Home Affairs director general Piet Colyn had been helpful, but she questioned whether lower- ranking officials who had to maintain the list after 1994 necessarily &quot;have an understanding of the policies of the new government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She accepted blame on the part of the new government for the slow pace of reform in the department. &quot;We have not made any serious attempts to say this is what we want ... Then, when things go wrong, we ask why they did not happen in line with our policies.&quot; Plans were afoot to re-train Home Affairs officials and make the department &quot;humane&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her intended review committee would expunge unnecessary names and set rules on who should be included in future. In line with international practice, only crime suspects would be debarred from entering the country on the advice of organisations like Interpol. The new stoplist would remain confidential because of constraints involved in the fight against crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sisulu, an ANC appointee, said she was getting on well with Home Affairs Minister and Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. &quot;At a personal level he is one of the gentlest people, very different from the public perception I had of him ... I have been -- touch wood -- pleasantly surprised.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The truth commission's announcement this week that it will subpoena suspects in some of the most prominent political atrocities of the apartheid era comes on the eve of two other major developments that could dramatically alter the way the body has operated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth process has so far been dominated by public hearings of the human rights violations committee -- causing some right-wing circles to parody it as the Kleenex commission -- while the body's amnesty hearings and judgments, which involve more complex and legalistic procedures, have lagged behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far 1 750 people have applied for amnesty from the commission. But the vast majority of these are people already convicted and serving sentences for their crimes -- the commission's records show that only 95 non-prisoners have so far offered to tell all in return for immunity from prosecution.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Next week political parties will present public accounts of why their members engaged in human rights abuse during the apartheid period. The amnesty committee has announced its first judgment is imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Official participation by political parties in the truth process next week could open the way for co- operation by perpetrators who belong to some of the right-wing groups which have a tradition of following the example set by their leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The major political parties drew lots to determine the order in which they will make their submissions to the commission. The political party submissions have been kept under tight wraps and have not even been sent to the commission in advance, in case they are leaked to the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First off will be the Freedom Front on Monday, followed by the African Christian Democratic Party. The Pan Africanist Congress appears on Tuesday, while the National Party will talk on Wednesday. The African National Congress will deliver its presentation on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mail &amp; Guardian has established that the NP's account of the 1980s is some 25 pages long and deals with a broad set of strategies adopted to deal with what its members perceived to be the &quot;total onslaught&quot;. The ANC's document is &quot;voluminous&quot; and deals quite frankly with abuses that were carried out by its members in the notorious detention centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, thousands of agents who committed political murder and human rights abuses in those turbulent years will be much more interested in the first judgment of the truth commission's amnesty committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This will be a test of how the committee will interpret its powers to grant immunity in exchange for full confessions about past misdeeds. It will provide crucial guidelines for perpetrators who are still weighing up whether it is worth their while to apply for amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The truth commission legislation states that the Norgaard Principles should be used to decide whether a perpetrator be granted immunity from prosecution for crimes committed because of political motivation. Most importantly, these state that the &quot;proportionality&quot; principle -- that crimes can only be forgiven if they were carried out in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">proportion to the political ideal that was beingfought for at the time -- be used to decide if perpetrators should be granted amnesty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Truth commission spokesman John Allen said the body was not seriously concerned about media coverage that depicted it as a toothless body unable to force &quot;dirty tricks&quot; agents into coming clean about their role in maintaining white domination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be natural for perpetrators to wait for the amnesty committee to indicate how it will apply the Norgaard Principles before making a decision about whether they should submit applications,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted the deadline for making amnesty applications is December 15 and the commission expected a flood of requests from perpetrators who are currently adopting a wait-and-see approach towards the end of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commission vice-chairman Alex Boraine announced this week that suspected perpetrators of past political crimes will be issued with subpoenas to appear before the truth body if they refuse to offer evidence voluntarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new get-tough approach will form part of a strategy that involves a series of probes by the commission's investigative unit into some of the worst atrocities committed during the apartheid era.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government is going to battle to reduce the public service to meet its stated targets over the next three years, and to cut the enormous wage bill generated by its many employees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Senior sources in the Finance Department say it is accepted that targets are over-ambitious, and that the reduction of the public service will be at a much slower rate than projected to the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Public Service Ministry announced earlier that it would reduce its personnel by 100 000 each year for the next three years, in a bid to cut the state's more than R55-billion wage bill in accordance with the goals of the macro-economic plan. While there is a 7% attrition rate eating away at the numbers, the ministry is hoping severance packages will coax hundreds of thousands of civil servants out of its employ.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, concerns are mounting outside and inside the government that targets will not be met. This is despite 60 000 funded posts in the service already earmarked for scrapping.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A spot check by the Mail &amp; Guardian on a number of departments indicate the response by civil servants to the invitation of severance packages to be slow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Constitutional Development Department, for example, has only approved eight packages so far, with 42 applications on the director general's desk for consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Foreign Affairs has approved 13 severance packages, with 50 applications under consideration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Health Ministry said no final decision had yet been made about rightsizing, but that 70 applications were being considered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Mineral and Energy Department said it had increased its staff by 5% at the start of the year and it could not cut back at all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Justice Department is considering 596 applications for severance packages, but has not granted any yet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Labour Department is considering 275 applications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Department of Land Affairs has approved 40 packages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of departments refused to give figures, saying they report monthly on the rightsizing programme to the Public Service Ministry which has all the data. A number are still deciding whether they can make cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The deputy director general of the public service, Fanie Visser, said he was not in a position to judge how successful the rightsizing programme was at this stage because data was still being collected and information was &quot; contradictory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visser was grilled on the success of the slimming programme by Parliament's Finance Committee this week. The committee demanded regular reports on the rightsizing plans, with members expressing concern that the public service administration could not meet its targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting finance director general, Maria Ramos, said this week it was too early to comment on the process or the impact it may have on the macro- economic plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot; At the moment, there is no cause for concern ... The strategy takes into account that there will be an increase in the wage bill in the first few years, before the savings start kicking in,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A source in the Finance Department said it was accepted that there ought not be too many cuts in the personnel in essential services -- the police force, health workers and teachers -- which make up 70% of the public service.  This leaves only 30% of the service from which to draw the 300 000 reductions in the next three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source said there were pockets in the former TBVC and homeland administrations where reductions could be made -- for example, in the Eastern Cape and the Northern Province administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The source indicated that government employment could, in fact, rise in some areas, through job- creation programmes and through the establishment of local government administrations. These increases, he said, had been factored into the macro-economic plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Serfaas van der Berg of the University of Stellenbosch's Public Management School raised doubts this week about the public-service targets.  He is also worried the government has not come to grips with the implications of the rightsizing project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not sure whether the government is fully aware of the implications of the rightsizing project. There are pockets of information about, but the information does not seem to be shared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is also a lack of coherence in policy between the macro-economic policy, the policy underpinning public service transformation and the central policy of the government, the Reconstruction and Development Programme, which is about delivery. There is little evaluation about how well we are performing, and part of the problem is that we need many of the people in the public service to provide government services,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When sports writer Sipho Mthembu calmly walked into Brixton Murder and Robbery police station to hand himself over in connection with the death of fellow journalist Sibusiso Mabaso, few people had any idea of what caused the public shooting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Behind the killing, which left the black journalistic community reeling, was a tale of friendship turned sour. A tragic story of two men once as close as brothers, but who became victims of a society where personal disagreements are too often settled at the point of a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mabaso (34) was killed on August 3 while attending a high-profile party at the Karos Hotel in Hillbrow, to celebrate the crowning of the Miss Soweto beauty queen.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was his third day in a new job as a volunteer reporter on the news team of Soweto Community Radio, and he was enjoying himself mingling with some 300 celebrity revellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also enjoying the party was Mthembu. The two had once worked together on the Sowetan newspaper, but were now at loggerheads. As they faced each other, angry words were exchanged before Mthembu left the hotel temporarily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Soon afterwards several shots rang out in the crowded reception area and Mabaso slumped to the ground. His assailant was heard to shout: &quot;I told you I'd get you ... I've got you now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A number of guests and paramedics tried to revive Mabaso, but he died while being rushed to hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Within hours Mthembu, who still worked on the Sowetan as a writer specialising in athletics, had presented himself to the police at Hillbrow station. He was told no docket existed on the shooting and it was suggested that he return the next day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to friends, Mthembu was frustrated about police inaction over a charge of abduction and assault he had made against Mabaso earlier this year.  He was also in fear of his life after Mabaso had threatened to kill him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The seeds of this &quot;brotherly'' feud were sown earlier this year after Mabaso resigned from the Sowetan in the wake of a bitter dispute with the editor over his lengthy absence from work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had returned to the paper after a 10-year absence, but was apparently disgruntled over his low salary and what he considered was a lack of appreciation of his talents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not long after leaving the paper Mabaso was seen driving a smart car, wearing expensive clothes and in possession of an array of expensive electrical equipment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had a good hi-fi system, television, video and jewellery,'' said a friend who did not want to be identified. &quot;No one knew where they came from, but it was widely believed that he was involved in the criminal underworld.  He was never short of money anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eventually Mabaso was arrested by the police and charged with armed robbery.  While he was in custody he turned to his friend Mthembu, asking him to look after his possessions at his new house in Naledi Extension, Soweto. Friends say Mthembu also paid his bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But on his release from jail Mabaso discovered that his home had been burgled and all his precious goods, worth thousands of rand, had been stolen.  He blamed Mthembu, who denied any involvement, but Mabaso was not convinced.  He seethed over the matter for a while before planning his revenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to colleagues, he hired a gang of youths to abduct Mthembu from his home in Soweto one Saturday in April. They tortured the hapless victim with lit cigarettes, whipped him with electrical cable, beat him up and immersed him in a bath full of hot water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was then taken to a cemetery and told he would be shot unless he confessed his involvement in the robbery. The gang was only prevented from carrying out its threat when a passing group of youths heard a shot being fired and rushed to the scene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mthembu spent four days in hospital, after which he laid abduction charges against his friend. But the matter did not end there. Despite being questioned by the police, Mabaso was never charged and the matter was eventually dropped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Mabaso, who spent three years on Robben Island for his political activities, allegedly continued to threaten Mthembu that he would &quot;finish the job''. It was known that he carried a gun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A close friend of both men, who still works on the Sowetan, said: &quot;The shooting could have taken place in a dark alley, but I think the person was trying to make a statement. He wanted to show that he had lost confidence in the law and could not rely on it for his protection.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mthembu, who is out on R2 000 bail, is expected to appear in court on October 17.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The deputy speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Kgositsile, has stirred up furious controversy in the art community with an attack on the Mail &amp; Guardian for publishing the photograph of a prize- winning artwork.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile denies that she wants art censorship. But in an interview this week, she reiterated her view that &quot;regulations&quot; should be introduced to prevent newspapers from publishing certain images, and that &quot;people's pride and dignity cannot be trampled on in the name of freedom of expression&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The controversial artwork reproduced in this newspaper two weeks ago won this year's prize at the annual Martienssen student exhibition at the University of the Witwatersrand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entitled Useful Objects, it consists of a half- smoked Gauloise Blonde cigarette in a ceramic ashtray &quot;resembling (according to this reviewer) a black vagina, lips or a turd&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an article written for the Star on Tuesday, under the headline &quot;Poor taste must not pose as art&quot;, the deputy speaker described the &quot;outrage&quot; suffered by &quot;many black women&quot; due to the M&amp;G's photograph of the winning work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She concluded: &quot;If need be, legislation must protect our people from degradation that is likely to continue in the name of trying to keep up with some arbitrary artistic ideals not set by the majority of those affected by these academic debates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile's call for new censorship comes as parliament is debating a new, liberal film and publications Bill (see story above). But her proposal for a tightening of the anti-pornography elements of the Bill and for the inclusion of newspapers within it would go even further than the old Publications Act, which always excluded newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Academics at Wits, the university which is exhibiting the controversial work, said this week that while they &quot;respect and take seriously&quot; her concerns about racism and sexism, they believe &quot;it is essential that artworks such as Useful Objects be opened to public scrutiny&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given South Africa's history, particularly, we need to be critical and not fall back on any form of censorship&quot;, says acting head of the Fine Arts Department at Wits, Penny Siopis. &quot;The news media are crucial for engaging in such debates and should be supported in their task, however difficult.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The interpretation of an artistic image is always in the eye of the beholder,&quot; said artist and director of the 1997 Johannesburg Biennale, Bongi Dhlomo. &quot;People's responses will depend on their own personal contexts and frames of reference. The very arbitrariness of art presents a warning against any form of censorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Artist and critic Kendell Geers said it would be &quot;a very sad day when the state censors artists and sends them into exile. Politicians are quick to co- opt art to their own ends when it serves their needs and quick to condemn it when it does not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are also widespread fears that Kgositsile's attack signals a move to reintroduce apartheid-style censorship.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've been warning of these dangers,&quot; says the parliamentary affairs manager for the South African Institute of Race Relations, Colin Douglas. &quot; Once you give government the power to censor one thing they have the ability to censor another. The kind of societal reasons for censorship cited by Kgositsilesound ominously like those of the National Party when it was in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically the offending work was produced by a third-year female student, Kaolin Thompson. Operating within the tradition of feminist criticism, it aims to confront the very issues highlighted by Kgositsile in her article, namely the degradation of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even though I didn't intend it to be racially specific, I wanted the work to be about pain, to highlight the objectification of women and to place the personal in the public sphere&quot;, explained Thompson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The work touches on taboos and that is one of its strengths,&quot; added artist and fine art lecturer Leora Farber, who was one of the Martiennsen judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its ironies, parodies and biting criticism can easily be understood within the context of contemporary art, not as advocating violence, but condemning it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kgositsile admitted this week that her response might have been different if she had known the work was by a woman and a feminist. But she insists that her message would have remained the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are not saying that artists should be arrested for creating, exhibiting, or selling their art, no matter how controversial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But certain art should not go into the public domain, particularly at this point of our history, with our legacy of oppression. I represent traditional black women whose history is vastly different to those of their white counterparts, and who, because of that, perceive things differently.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added: &quot;Material must be classified to exercise discretion as to what is harmless and what is not. And in the interests of nation-building, newspapers have a responsibility to ensure this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But many &quot;traditionalists&quot; stop short of calling for a return to censorship.  Helen Sebidi, one of South Africa's foremost artists -- a self-confessed conservative and anti-feminist -- is one of them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born in Hammanskraal, she learnt from an early age what it was to suffer abuse, not at the hands of a man, but a white woman. &quot;I wasn't treated like a human, but an object,&quot; she recalled. Sebidi has taken a strong personal stand against the artistic representation of nudes and sexual organs which she describes as &quot;the garden of God&quot;. She also advocates a return to traditional African values. But she insists that others have the right to feel and act differently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even religious groups are divided over the issue of censorship. A representative from the African Christian Democratic Party said: &quot;the government must protect the country's morals through censorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rhema church, however, was more circumspect. Said Pastor Ron Steele: &quot;One hates to speak of censorship, particularly because of its effects during apartheid. And although newspapers have a responsibility to lean towards caution, we would be loath to have legislation forcing them to toe the line.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A group of African National Congress women MPs have launched an eleventh-hour bid to return South Africa to the calvinistic days of star- covered nipples and black tape over salacious text.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are bidding to turn back the clock on the passage of the Film and Publications Bill, believing it is too soft on pornography and that women's views have not been canvassed widely enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the ANC was among the parties to back the bill when it was approved by the National Assembly's portfolio committee on Home Affairs on Wednesday (only the African Christian Democratic Party opposed it), members of the ANC women's caucus are expected to put up a strong fight to have the consultation process reopened.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They include the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, ANC MP Baleka Kgositsile. In a column in The Star this week, Kgositsile said that despite 4 000 written and 28 oral submissions, &quot;particular stakeholders in society with strong views&quot; on the bill had not participated in the debate.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She also expressed outrage at the publication in the Mail &amp; Guardian of a photograph of an artwork depicting a black woman's vagina in the form of a ceramic ashtray, saying people's dignity should not be trampled on in the name of freedom of expression (see article below).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home affairs deputy minister Lindiwe Sisulu is also understood to be uncomfortable about having to introduce to parliament a bill that, rightly or wrongly, is perceived to be soft on pornography and the degradation of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inkatha Freedom Party leader and Home Affairs minister Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has had little to do with the bill, having left it to Sisulu's predecessor, Penuell Maduna, to deal with.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This week's committee meeting went ahead only after a flurry of behind-the- scenes meetings. On Tuesday it was agreed between committee chair, ANC MP Desmond Lockey, the ANC study group on home affairs and Sisulu, that the committee could proceed with considering the bill on condition Lockey agreed to address the ANC women's caucus on the matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The caucus held an urgently convened meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC women's caucus convener Nozizwe Madlala- Routledge said the draft bill would also be discussed at a meeting of the all-party women's parliamentary group on Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill itself, which will repeal the country's old, draconian censorship laws, attempts to strike a balance between honouring the constitutional right to freedom of expression and at the same time offering protection to women and children from exploitation, abuse and degradation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It provides for a board which, acting on complaints from the public, can ban distribution of XX material which covers films and magazines depicting child sex, explicit sexual violence, bestiality, &quot;degrading&quot; sex and explicit violence which amounts to incitement to cause harm or violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Specially licensed premises will be able to sell non-violent sexually explicit material (rated X18) to adults only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Films and videos would be rated by the board before distribution, with R18 (less explicit than X18-rated material) material generally available, but only to adults in a sealed wrapper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bona fide literary, dramatic, documentary, scientific and artworks would be exempted -- but in one of the committee's amendments, the art exemption does not apply to works portraying child sex or a lewd display of nude children.  Possession of child porn is banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bill also bans distribution of material advocating hatred based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion which could incite people to cause harm, as well as material advocating war and violence except in bona fide cases. This area will be dealt with by the courts; the board will, however, be able to ban a film or book which advocates hatred based on religion, provided it amounts to incitement to cause harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Material falling outside these areas would either be free of restriction or covered by age restrictions and warnings informing people they could be offended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With existing censorship laws punched full of loopholes by the interim constitution, controlling the distribution of sexually explicit material has been made almost impossible and has focused attention on the need to get the legislation -- in the works for almost two years now -- through as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lockey said the ANC parliamentary caucus had &quot;unanimously agreed&quot; on the bill. &quot;If people now want to change the bill it is for them to go back to caucus and ask it to rescind its previous decision.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Changes could still be made as the bill had to be considered by the Senate after it goes before the National Assembly on August 29.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With no concrete objections before us from the women's caucus we could not make changes at Wednesday's meeting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Jack Kemp, currently running as the Republican candidate for vice-president in the United States elections, was deeply embarrassed in the late 1980s by revelations that South African military intelligence agents had offered senior officials in his campaign committee a R2-million jet in exchange for a direct influence over future United States policy towards Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African superspy Craig Williamson told the Mail &amp; Guardian this week that the International Freedom Front (IFF), a right-wing think tank funded by army intelligence in the South African Defence Force, had planned to buy a jet worth about $450 000 for Kemp's campaign committee while the senator was making a bid for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Williamson also confirmed reports that the South African intelligence agents who ran the IFF from Johannesburg had expected automatic membership in Kemp's &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot; and hoped to name an assistant secretary of state for Africa in a future Kemp administration as a reward for providing the Republican senator's campaign committee with a jet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no evidence, however, that Kemp had any knowledge at the time of the wheelings and dealings that were taking place between members of his campaign committee and agents of Pretoria's intelligence fraternity. Kemp is in fact a moderate Republican who lobbied for economic sanctions against the apartheid state despite a veto by then President Ronald Reagan on the trade embargo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documents obtained last year by the New York publication Newsday reveal that IFF mastermind Russell Crystal played a prominent role in the abortive 1987 scheme to buy office and influence in a future White House administration. Crystal was a right-wing spy at the University of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witwatersrand in the 1980s and went on to take part in various clandestine operations for police and military intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents show that Colleen Morrow, then treasurer for the IFF at its public headquarters in Washington, had sent an internal memo to the foundation's actual operational headquarters in Johannesburg asking that $450 000 be allocated to the purchase of a plane for Kemp's campaign at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can be the kitchen cabinet types of the Kemp administration,&quot; Morrow said in the memo to Crystal, who was de facto head of the IFF at the time. &quot; Due to a loophole in FEC (Federal Electoral Commission) law, one person -- the person who provides the plane -- has the capacity to become the largest donor to the Kemp campaign ... Clearly we have the opportunity to become Jack Kemp's favourite people in the world (if we can only find him a plane).&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The memo dated May 26 1987 was in response to a letter from the Kemp campaign asking her &quot;assistance with helping the Jack Kemp for President Committee find the use of a jet&quot;. That letter was signed by Michael Simpfenderfer, finance coordinator for the Kemp campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp himself was deeply embarrassed when the operation was exposed by Newsday. He described Simfenderfer as &quot;a rogue elephant&quot; who was subsequently sacked by the Republicans. &quot;I've made a lot of mistakes in my life, but that's not one of them, tying myself to South African intelligence,&quot; Kemp told Newsday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I take responsibility, I guess, for my campaign. If I had known then what I know now, (a) it wouldn't have happened, and (b) if it did happen without me authorising it, I would have fired him.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the IFF had gone ahead to provide the plane, the transaction would have been a violation of United States law which prevents not-for-profit organisations from making such donations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Williamson says he pulled the plug on the proposed deal by advising intelligence &quot;powers that be&quot; that it was not worth spending the money because it was unlikely that Kemp would win the presidential nomination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The scheme then collapsed and the Kemp campaign folded not long afterwards.  Vice-President George Bush went on to win the Republican nomination and the presidency, and Kemp served in the Bush cabinet as minister of housing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp's efforts to gain high office were revived this week when he was named as running mate for presidential candidate Bob Dole. A popular football star in his time, the vice-presidential candidate has brought some glamour and populist appeal into the Republican line-up against Bill Clinton this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has often clashed with conservative colleagues in the past over their free-marketeering economic policies and has made a number of enemies in the party by supporting social welfare programmes, a ban on the sale of automatic weapons and affirmative action programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kemp's track record suggests it is highly unlikely he would have colluded in the IFF's shady dealings. But the botched 1987 plot does show how South Africa's intelligence agencies made clandestine use of taxpayers' money in fanciful schemes to buy direct influence over United States policy on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Army intelligence spent about R6-million a year on the IFF, which was code- named &quot;Operation Babushka&quot; at the time. The man directly in charge of the scheme was Ferdi van Wyk who liaised with Crystal via the codename &quot;Gypsy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The IFF presented itself as a Washington-based think tank for the American right and successfully recruited a number of conservative politicians into its ranks. High-profile support from powerful men like Senator Jesse Helms allowed the foundation to attract large donations from individuals and institutions in the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Permanent residents no longer qualify for state pensions or social assistance grants, following the implementation on March 1 of the Social Assistance Act, drafted and passed by the National Party government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Black Sash says it will take this aspect of the Act to the Human Rights Commission, should the Minister of Welfare, Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, fail to change it to accommodate permanent residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheena Duncan of the Black Sash said a number of permanent residents had approached the Johannesburg Advice Office after March 1, not understanding why they could not get pensions. Duncan said most of these people were from neighbouring states, had lived in South Africa for many years and had struggled for a long time to get permanent resident status. Having got it, they were being told by the government they did not qualify for pensions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Duncan is particularly worried about permanent residents from neighbouring states who worked on a contract basis in South Africa, for example in the mines or in industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is discriminatory to exclude them because permanent residents pay tax and contribute fully to South African society, in every way except on the political level,&quot; said Duncan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Black Sash has lodged an appeal with the minister of welfare to have the law changed, or to use a legal loophole to bring permanent residents back into the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The department has responded by saying that not even representations by the Black Sash will change its stand on this. It claims to have consulted the Black Sash on the issue, which the Black Sash denies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While those permanent residents who had been receiving pensions and grants up until March 1 will continue to receive grants, no new permanent residents will qualify.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A department spokesman said it was too expensive to provide for permanent residents and that many of them received pensions from their country of origin and thus the expense was not justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman also said that it had had problems in the past with paying illegal immigrants state pensions by mistake. The Welfare Department, like all other government departments, is having to prune its budget to meet the demands of fiscal discipline imposed by the macro-economic growth plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is currently extending permanent resident status to an expected million or more illegal immigrants in South Africa from neighbouring states, who will not be eligible for pensions in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They will become a particularly vulnerable group in old age or illness because it is unlikely that they will receive pensions from their countries of origin. Most are unskilled and poor, they are cut off from their extended families and they have probably not made provision for their old age.&quot;These people will be accommodated by developmental social welfare programmes. Which means that people in need should be cared for in their communities,&quot; the Welfare Department said this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A leading member of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) claims his organisation has been sidetracked by militant activists and fears it will falter in the coming weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The member, who asked not to be named but who said he intended raising his misgivings within the organisation, said unless Pagad reverted to its original form as a pressure group, its prospects for survival were slim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am extremely worried about the direction Pagad is taking. There is no attempt to apologise for Rashaad Staggie's death and little talk in meetings about other forms of action besides that which is most militant.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said what was launched as a broad campaign to combat drug dealing and gangsterism in the Cape has been transformed into an organisation with one executive committee member in jail facing charges of sedition, and the rest on the run from the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was there from the start, in February. The intention was to launch a pressure group to harass the government into taking action against gangsters and dealers. From the first march to Parliament in May, it was obvious that mostly Muslims were involved. Although there were two priests at the head of the march, the followers were chanting 'Allahu Akbar'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really don't understand why Pagad was so defensive about being labelled Muslim. The majority of people who started it were Muslim, and so were most who joined later. The Muslim community should be proud that it took the initiative to tackle this important campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm not sure about the jihad, though. It was declared by Ali 'Phantom' Parker. I always thought only someone a little higher, someone more clerical, had the authority to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no misgivings about Pagad giving Justice Minister Dullah Omar a deadline to respond to its demand that he take action against drug dealers. But the organisation had never discussed what it would do when the deadline expired, and he became extremely concerned when he realised what the intentions were.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Pagad members invaded Omar's home after the deadline expired, he realised the organisation was becoming far more militant than a public pressure group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the attacks on drug dealers' homes and properties which followed made him even more worried about Pagad's tactics, and the murder of Staggie had been &quot;inexcusable&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Staggie's death was not planned in any meeting I attended, and so I thought the organisation would publicly distance itself from it. But they seemed to relish the idea that they claim responsibility.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the police approach to Pagad was not helping to diminish the militancy in its ranks. Gangsters were allowed to smoke dagga openly at their march last Sunday, but when Pagad members tried to march on dealers, the police shot teargas and birdshot at them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;(Pagad leader) Nadthmie Edries gets arrested and held without bail, while for years dealers and gangsters who had been arrested walk out on bail a few hours later to commit crimes again. That doesn't help cool the atmosphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He slammed Western Cape politicians and policemen, whom he said were trying to destroy Pagad by attacking its credibility. &quot;(Western Cape Premier) Hernus Kriel has been making the most dishonest statements I have heard from a politician. He has dismissed Pagad as a fundamentalist movement. It wasn't one at the start, and it could be taken back to its original form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no doubt there were people in Pagad who had joined to promote their own agendas and motives. &quot;That's what happens when you launch a broad organisation and invite anyone who shares your ideals to join.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had agonised about withdrawing from the organisation because he believed its original vision and ideals were &quot;wonderful. But its tactics are not wonderful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I really do believe that if you want peace you have to fight for it, but I have reached the conclusion that Pagad is going about its business the wrong way. It's no use taking out Staggie, there are many dealers who will jump to take his place. What will Pagad do? Go out and kill those dealers too? This will only lead to endless turmoil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What Pagad set out to achieve has partially happened now. The authorities are sitting up and taking notice; they are, in their own haphazard way, attempting to deal with the problems in the Western Cape.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had no doubt Qibla had infiltrated Pagad. Initially it had taken a back seat, but it was now on the brink of taking over the organisation: &quot;When you sit in a meeting, you know Qibla's there. I know very little about it, most of what I know now I learnt in Pagad meetings. I was once in a meeting where young men claimed openly that they were trained in Libya. At first I dismissed this as bold talk, but now I'm not so sure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I suppose they have the right to be involved in Pagad, but I am concerned that they are directing the organisation in a way which we never intended it to go. There is too much talk about violent action, not enough about peaceful protest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the young men boasted that they were prepared to be martyrs for their cause, but he doubted they really would take such a step. A young taxi driver, who was allegedly killed by gangsters in a reprisal attack a week ago, was not held up in Pagad meetings as a martyr and a person to emulate. &quot; People get forgotten so quickly. A life was shed, but I predict that in a year's time no one will remember his name.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I'm certainly not prepared to be a martyr. There must be other ways to combat drugs and gangs without laying down your life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was concerned that the police appeared to be arresting and seeking the more &quot;moderate&quot; members of the organisation. This created an opportunity for more militant leaders to take control of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pagad needs to clear its name or they will lose me. I am happy to continue being a member if it conducts its campaign in a more law-abiding way.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Police ignored more than 30 intelligence reports about Pagad's potential for violence and had been monitoring the organisation for six months before gang leader Rashaad Staggie was murdered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police intelligence began monitoring People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) in March, after members of the organisation invaded Justice Minister Dullah Omar's home in an attempt to put pressure on him to take action against drug dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence reports compiled before last Sunday's murder of Staggie detailed Pagad's plan of action and the potential for conflict with gangsters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But until Staggie's murder, no action had been taken to quash Pagad's plans and police found themselves unprepared when the organisation besieged Staggie's home.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack on Staggie was launched from the Gatesville mosque, where a convoy of 500 cars left for his Salt River house. There were only two police vehicles monitoring the mosque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police intelligence source said a report -- saying Pagad was gearing up to confront Staggie -- had been sent to the public order division two days before the attack: &quot;Although the report said Staggie's Sea Point house was the target, much more could have been done to avoid the bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The report said the attack would be launched from the Gatesville mosque and that the potential for violence was very high. So why were only two police vehicles sent to the mosque?&quot;By that stage, Pagad had already been involved in nine violent attacks on alleged drug dealers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a task team of 400 for visible policing, working in shifts of 100 at a time. They could have been sent to the mosque. They could have used teargas to head off the marchers when they reached Staggie's house.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of the earlier intelligence reports made specific recommendations to police provincial management, particularly that they meet Pagad in an attempt to head off conflict before it became violent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet the first meeting between Pagad and police management took place on July 29, after the organisation had attacked drug dealers' homes on the Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reports were just not taken seriously. There was a belief these people were just a bunch of fanatics,&quot; said another police source. &quot;There was no understanding of Muslim politics. When Muslims come together, police intelligence immediately reacts by saying it's a fundamentalist conspiracy; Libya and Iran must be involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was only one person working on collecting intelligence on Pagad.  Despite reports indicating that there was a potential for violence, the person only received assistance after Pagad started violent action.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police sources complain that the reason for the police inaction on the intelligence reports is a lack of understanding among police operatives of the situation on the Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The majority of the senior members in intelligence are former security policemen. They were notoriously uncaring of black lives in the past and there is no reason to believe they have changed,&quot; said a police source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;After the integration of the ANC and South African Police, the majority of senior ranks went to former security policemen. The ANC operatives, who were very close to their communities and had complete understanding of what was happening there, were not given any authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Police intelligence is still caught in the past, they can't see beyond their old understanding of how black politics works. They were warned that Pagad was linking crime with bad government, that it was blaming the government for the problem in their areas, and that at some point it was going to act against government authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even now, with the establishment of a national task team to deal with the situation in the Cape, only two of the 25 people on the team are not white.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports from operatives in the field are forwarded to a provincial desk officer who forwards them to an analyst to make recommendations. An information manager recommends what action has to be taken, whether cases have to be opened, negotiations begun or more intelligence collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Intelligence Agency, army intelligence and police intelligence meet weekly, and intelligence reports are passed on to an intelligence production unit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was only after Pagad began its violent attacks on drug dealers that the first police intelligence reports went to those meetings, so there was no possibility of a joint response,&quot; said a police source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape Anti-Crime Forum leader Irvin Kinnes said he had been approached by &quot;disillusioned&quot; police officers, who told him senior police management had been warned Staggie would be killed but had taken no action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He had arranged for them to brief the justice minister on the situation on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was quite clear to me that the police had no plan to deal with Pagad.  The forum had warned Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi as well about the increase in vigilante activity in the Western Cape. It now appears the police not only ignored us, but their own people as well,&quot; Kinnes said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Western Cape National Party leader Dawie de Villiers has been tipped for an ambassadorship, along with Inkatha Freedom Party MP Lionel Mtshali, in a new round of appointments expected also to include the Pan Africanist Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Villiers' imminent appointment comes hot on the heels of former NP parliamentary deputy speaker Bhadra Ranchod's decision to accept an ambassadorship.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">His departure will be another blow to the National Party's verligte ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela has also heeded the IFP's two-year pleas for an ambassadorship by offering it the post in Argentina.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in a letter to a newspaper, IFP head Mangosuthu Buthelezi said IFP Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela claimed to have arranged the new ambassadorial posting, and said &quot;it was not for Mzimela or anyone in the party except me to make these proposals&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - African National Congress Women's League president Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has warned the ANC of &quot;further bruising&quot; concerning Sol Kerzner's relationship with the organisation in a letter to Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Axed deputy minister of environment affairs Bantu Holomisa cited the letter in his submission to the ANC disciplinary committee hearing on Wednesday, which was postponed until Saturday after its chairman, Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal, recused himself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madikizela-Mandela wrote the letter to Mbeki on July 10 after being informed by the ANC's treasurer general and chief whip, the Reverend Arnold Stofile, that the league's head office activities had been &quot;frozen&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter Madikizela-Mandela claims the action was taken to &quot; destabilise the provinces&quot; to sabotage the League's Women's Day celebrations on August 9 -- and also because the organisation came out in support of Holomisa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is imperative for us to be told in black and white why we are being punished for supporting a comrade,&quot; Mandela wrote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She then says: &quot;It is critical for this organisation not to handle an issue of this nature in this manner, especially as it involves Sol Kerzner ultimately. The organisation will not survive further bruising in this manner and I think some people who took part in this decision will know what I am talking about.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this paragraph Holomisa cited in his submission, saying events around Kerzner's ANC contribution -- initially vehemently denied by the organisation, then confirmed by President Nelson Mandela -- had been &quot;characterised by the attempts of the leadership to influence me to drop the charges&quot;. He contended the pressure he was being subjected to had a &quot;symbiotic relationship with my failure or refusal to accede to the 'request' to drop or 'expedite' the case against Sol Kerzner, hence my assertion that there is a conflict of interest&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa said Madikizela-Mandela was a member of the ANC's national working committee (NWC), which found -- ahead of Mandela's confirmation of Kerzner's donation -- that Holomisa's allegations were &quot;blatantly false, malicious and defamatory&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his submission, Holomisa asked: &quot;The key question here is, did the president of the Women's League know about the confirmed R2-million contribution to the ANC or is she referring to other contributions which we might not be aware of?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Madikizela-Mandela refused to comment this week, but in her letter to Mbeki she says she wonders whether the action against the league would have been contemplated had it &quot;been under another leadership of some people's choice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There seems to be a continued problem with differentiating between the organisational policies, the government and personal agendas.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She says the freezing of the league's head office activities is viewed as part of an &quot;orchestrated campaign&quot; to discredit league national executive members &quot;further fuelling divisions and cliques we now observe under this style of leadership&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa, meanwhile, will attend the ANC's national executive committee (NEC) meeting, which starts this friday. This is when the hearing of the six charges against him will reconvene.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Holomisa insists his removal as deputy minister is &quot;inextricably woven&quot; with his testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, where he referred to public enterprises minister Stella Sigcau taking a R50 000 cut of a bribe paid by Kerzner to George Matanzima, then president of the Transkei.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC has said the complaint is not that he gave evidence, but that he publicly accused a fellow ANC NEC member of corruption &quot;on a distorted set of facts&quot; without first raising it within ANC structures and subsequently publicly snubbed the ANC, its senior leaders and its disciplinary committee without first raising his grievances internally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new charges relate to further violations of the &quot;basic principle of the ANC&quot;, that its members should not make public accusations or complaints against the organisation, its leaders or members without first doing so within party structures. He is also accused of conducting himself in a manner which has brought the ANC into disrepute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his submission, Holomisa said he suspected his appearance before the committee was &quot;just a formality&quot;, as there was wide speculation that its outcome would be his expulsion from the ANC. He said the ANC Youth League, of which Mbeki was the patron, had already called for his expulsion, and handed in a Sowetan article quoting unnamed ANC leaders who question Holomisa's motives and signal a clear message that &quot;Holomisa must go&quot;. The article, Holomisa claimed, was based on an interview the reporter had with Mbeki on August 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So you can see a decision has been taken already to expel me from the organisation and in the process (be) discredited,&quot; Holomisa's submission said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While some commentators have seen Asmal's recusal as a victory for the beleaguered Holomisa, enabling him to once again set the terms, Asmal made it clear he believed he had said nothing to prejudge the case against Holomisa.  He had recused himself because &quot;the appearance of fairness and impartiality is as important as the reality&quot;, he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister of Public Service and Administration, Zola Skweyiya, who has a doctorate in law, will chair the committee, while Trade and Industry minister Alex Erwin presents the case against Holomisa. Other members of the committee are Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, and NEC members Ruth Mompati and Wilton Mkwayi. Zuma was not present at the NWC meeting which decided Holomisa was a liar for saying Kerzner had given the party funds and any bid to have her recuse herself is likely to fail.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - On the eve of the elections in 1994, Qibla leader Achmad Cassiem pronouced from platforms in mosques in the Cape that South Africa would be an Islamic state by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Between 1994 and today, the organisation has not attracted thousands of people to its ranks to fight its cause, but it has found a vehicle to mobilise people on religious lines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) has vehemently attempted to shrug off the label of Islamic fundamentalism -- an indication, insiders say, that cracks are appearing in the movement and that it is attempting to distance itself from the militant faction which has invaded it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation's public statements have done little to dispel fears that it is a radical Muslim organisation. It has declared jihad (just war) at every march participants have chanted Allahu Akbar (God is great), it claims to have support from Hezbollah and Hamas, and its members are draped in Palestinian scarves.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the organisation's rally last Sunday, every speaker was Muslim, and all quoted from the Qur'an while protesting the media's portrayal of Pagad as a Muslim organisation. The rally started with prayers delivered by members of the Muslim clergy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad members, police intelligence and Muslim clergy have warned that Qibla is attempting to hijack Pagad, but most observers believe the organisation does not have the staying power to keep Pagad alive or to swell its ranks considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qibla (which means direction) was launched by Cassiem in 1979 to promote the establishment of an Islamic state in South Africa. It played a prominent role in the Western Cape in the 1980s to stir up insurrection against the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has never enjoyed mass membership, although in the 1980s some of its members were sent to Libya for military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organisation claimed responsibility for an attack on an Athlone tavern in 1984, and two of its members served spells in prison afterwards. Insiders say they are now disillusioned with Qibla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qibla has never recognised the legitimacy of the South African state -- both the former regime and the African National Congress government. &quot;In terms of its political morality, the state is a legitimate target. Its intentions are to put the Muslim community on a collision course with the state,&quot; said a political observer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its perception is that middle-class Muslims support the ANC, and that these people should be lured away from the ANC. It hit the jackpot when Pagad began mobilising that community and it found the door wide open to get involved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many Muslim clerics are distancing themselves from Qibla and are voicing concerns that Pagad be rescued from the organisation's hijacking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Until Sunday, Cassiem was held back from getting openly involved in Pagad by the Islamic Unity Convention (which he chairs),&quot; said a senior Muslim cleric. &quot;It was worried that the licence application for its community radio station was about to be heard and there were already rumblings that the intelligence community was unhappy at the way it was fomenting violence in the Muslim community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But publicity is an aphrodisiac to Cassiem, and since Sunday's Pagad rally, there seems to be no holding him back. He speaks on behalf of Pagad and has now seemingly rejected the olive branch (Police Commisioner George) Fivaz was holding out to the organisation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The cleric suggested Cassiem's young followers, who have taken a leading role in Pagad's militant actions, were also held in check by the Islamic Unity Convention (IUC), the biggest Muslim organisation in the Western Cape.  They had found an outlet for their militancy in Pagad, which had far less intellectual leadership. On Wednesday, the IUC distanced itself from Pagad's militant stance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers believe Qibla has only a handful of followers to infiltrate into Pagad, but they note that people who have now assumed the mantle of leadership in the organisation are Qibla members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">How well-trained they are is also in dispute. &quot;Three months ago there was a rumour Hamas was coming to South Africa,&quot; said the political observer. &quot;The media jumped on the story. Nelson Mandela was in hospital having a check-up and the press besieged him with questions, to which he responded that he would welcome Hamas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There was no truth in that story, despite Israeli intelligence spreading the rumour. But these kinds of rumours are never officially dispelled and the belief remains in people's minds.&quot; He said when Muslims stated they were training young men in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban to send to fight in Bosnia, many believed that story as well. Not one Muslim returned after fighting in the war, and he doubted that any had left the country in the first place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two years ago, pamphlets were distributed in Cape Town, purportedly issued by Hizbullah. Although intelligence operatives investigated whether they had links with Hizbullah abroad, no link was found.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is no doubt there are people intent on establishing an Islamic state in South Africa. Cassiem has been saying that's what he wants for years. If the best they can do to achieve this is infiltrate another organisation, then the sun will not dawn on an Islamic state for many years,&quot; said the cleric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Qibla has never sustained a campaign for a long period. I hope it doesn't succeed now. At best, Cassiem is a revolutionary without a cause. These people are a nuisance rather than a threat. They're very good at masking their faces, shaking their guns and intimidating the public, but they're never going to win mass support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All they're looking for is a picture opportunity, and unfortunately they're getting quite a few now.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Journalists are once again being targeted, as the war in the Cape Flats continues between the Muslim community group, People against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) and gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the 12 days following the shooting and torching of Hard Livings gangster leader, Rashaad Staggie, one reporter and four photographers have been injured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reporter from Die Burger in Cape Town suffered a gunshot wound in his arm and the newspaper'sphotographer suffered shrapnel wounds to his lower leg.  The other two photographers are freelancers and details of their injuries are unknown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Several journalists, photographers and cameramen claim to have been openly threatened at a press conference hosted by Pagad. Some Muslim journalists have also allegedly received anonymous phone calls from people who purport to be Pagad members, warning them about stories they have written or are planning to write.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says one South African Broadcasting Corporation journalist, who refused to be named for fear of her life: &quot;I believe they will do it. Pagad will not hesitate in shooting us. We were openly told at a Pagad press conference that if we didn't do stories which were favourable and sympathetic towards their cause, then we better watch out. We were told that we will be regarded as part of the criminals and will be targeted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another SABC cameraman had a gun held to his head, but refused to speak to the Mail &amp; Guardian. His colleague says she finds it &quot;disturbing&quot; that neither the government or any press unions have spoken out against the groups targeting journalists. &quot;For days the media have been under death threat and no one, but no one has come out against this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African Union of Journalists (SAUJ) national organiser Dudley Moloi says the union was not informed of the death threats against journalists and has, therefore, made no statement. However, the SAUJ is planning to make a statement about the injuries suffered by journalists, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reuters television senior producer and cameraman Jimi Matthews says the threats to journalists' lives are &quot;disturbing, but not unexpected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is common that at scenes of conflict journalists become targets, especially when rival groups are frustrated. What is definitely scary is the open threats of violence against reporters, photographers and cameramen who are out there with no motive other than to do their jobs. It is disconcerting when guns are being waved at one in an effort to intimidate all reporters,&quot; says Matthews</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says there exists a misconception of the role and function of the media by the general public. &quot;People often want to dictate to journalists what they must write. People forget that journalists only report what they see and are not commissioned to do a story because it allows them to take sides.  Journalists aim at writing balanced reports, while photographers and cameramen get the picture or footage required.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthews says it's harder for photographers and cameramen to blend in with the crowd as cameras are &quot;very visible''. He says rumours, implicating photographers and cameramen with last week's assassination of taxi driver Faizel Ryklief, are circulating.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Matthews, there are allegations that Ryklief's assassination followed his identification from video footage and/or photographs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ryklief, allegedly a Pagad member, is believed to have been the target of a revenge attack by the gangsters, following the lynching of Staggie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is a popular perception and an easy way out to put the blame on cameramen. We are then told by Pagad not to sell our photographs and video material to the gangsters. This is insulting to journalists who will never implicate themselves in such a ludicrous manner,&quot; Matthews says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claims that cameramen and photographers are the focus of Pagad's attention as there is a misconception that the cameramen and photographers are either assisting the gangsters and/or the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matthews's claims have been supported by several journalists the Mail &amp; Guardian approached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One reporter from a foreign news agency says reporters, photographers and cameramen have all come under enormous pressure, but admits there is a &quot; misunderstanding&quot; that the death of Ryklief was as a result of an identification from photographs and video footage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Photographers and cameramen seem to have the blame laid at their feet as people assume it is soley owing to their material that Ryklief was killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have been allegations by a reporter that during his interview with the brother of the assassinated Hard Livings gang leader, Rashied Staggie, he saw him rummaging through photographs which presumably were smuggled out of the Argus library.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was scary because there he was flipping through photographs which were stamped: Argus Company. It is difficult to say how he got the photographs, but anyone could have smuggled the photographs out ,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the Freedom of Expression Institute, Raymond Louw, says he hopes journalists and photographers &quot;will not bow to the demands of militants&quot; , but &quot;will uphold the traditions of their craft and continue to report in an accurate and balanced manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Hopefully the community will respect journalists as observers doing their professional jobs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Louw says it is entirely up to reporters to decide whether they are going to cover a particular story and endanger their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he says, it is &quot;easy to pontificate from an armchair&quot;, while reporters and photographers are out on the frontline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I respect their bravery out on the frontline as they perform their duty by getting the story to the general public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Times photographer Benny Gool, whose photographs of the torching of the Staggie twin were splashed across the front pages of several national newspapers, is keeping a low profile. He refused to speak to the M&amp;G for fear of his life and that of his family.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are claims, however, that the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) has informed Gool that a price has been put on his head, but it is unclear whether it is the Hard Livings gangsters or Pagad members who want to assassinate him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cape Times reporter who covered the story alongside Gool has apparently been pulled off the story by the newspaper's editor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Times editor Moegsien Williams could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some journalists claim that their colleagues often resort to sensationalism by misconstruing the community's efforts. Says one journalist: &quot;It is not only the Muslims that are fighting the drug lords, but there are several Christians and people of different religious persuasions that support what Pagad is doing. It is sometimes unfortunate that when Muslims stand up, they are seen as Islamic fundamentalists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this week, Pagad threatened to call in the support of two militant Middle Eastern organisations -- the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Palestinian Hamas organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The support of the organisations would be sought unless the government and the police rid the Cape Flats of gangsters and drug barons, said the organisation's leader, Muhammed Ali &quot;Phantom&quot; Parker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many journalists admit to being scared, with some deciding to forfeit a good story and get out while they are still ahead. Others have decided to hang in, because they feel they have to see the story through to the end. But none of the journalists, photographers or cameramen have expressed a gung-ho attitude; instead they are just attempting to do their jobs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">London - Gathering storm clouds overshadowed bumper half-year profits from diamond conglomerate De Beers this week. The sliding value of the rand and renewed uncertainty over a critical trade deal with the Russian government, combined to cast doubt on the survival of the company's worldwide marketing cartel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director Gary Ralfe said two weeks ago he had to fly to Moscow for emergency talks and to protest at a jump in the number of Russian stones leaking on to world markets, undermining the De Beers sales system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, De Beers, the world's largest diamond producer, is coping with the after-shocks of the walkout from the cartel in June of the world's biggest diamond mine, Argyle in Australia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mine had complained that De Beers's prices and quotas were tilted against smaller gems of the Argyle type; this week De Beers said it was trying to help the Indian cutting industry, unsettled by the walkout, to adjust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers chairman, Julian Ogilvie Thompson accused Argyle of &quot;rather a selfish act&quot;. Should other producers walk out of De Beers's Central Selling Organisation (CSO), he said, &quot;things really wouldn't work at all well&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Argyle accounted for just 6% of the CSO's rough- diamond intake; even without it, the CSO still controls about 80% of gemstone sales.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Far more serious is the threat of a breakdown in the detailed discussions with Russia, the second-largest producer in the world. An outline bargain struck inFebruary seemed to have averted the threat of a Russian walkout from the CSO, but the presidential elections and political in-fighting in Moscow have delayed final agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Tass news agency report on June 24 suggested, contrary to impressions received from De Beers, that months of hard bargaining lay ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Russian gem leakages, which averaged more than $62- million a month during 1993 and 1994, dropped to an average $12,2-million in March and April. But in June, leakages rose to perhaps $50-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ralfe said the August shutdown of cutting centres in Antwerp and Tel Aviv made it hard to judge present leakage levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Beers's attributable earnings rose 18% in US dollar terms in the six months to June 30, well ahead of analysts' expectations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In trying to bring the public service up to speed, the government has made a Faustian pact that could backfire, says one senior official in the Gauteng administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Only once we ran the statistics did we realise the scale of the problem.  We need more money to keep the better people, which means getting rid of more people. If our experience is translated to all nine provinces -- and we are more efficient than most -- we will need to cut more than 300 000 jobs in total.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Staff numbers are controlled by budgets now; the Finance and Fiscal Commission allots each province a certain amount for personnel and if the target is not met, there won't be any extra cash in the government's coffers to bail out miscreants. One solution might be to contract out to prove their numbers are down, but that could end up being counter-productive -- neither saving costs nor improving efficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, concern is growing over where the cuts will take place, and the concomitant effects on service delivery. Many fear health and education will be the first victims, further stretching an already overburdened system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But says Paddy Maharaj, Gauteng chief director of planning and budgeting, cuts will take place according to national norms and standards. In Gauteng, for example, the average is 30 pupils per high school teacher; the national ratio is 35:one. Thus there is scope for cuts. Health is a different matter, he says, and much more difficult to judge but the provinces are busy conducting workload analyses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nevertheless, he remains optimistic that the downsizing and rightsizing will work: &quot;This is a tremendous opportunity to address the issues of bureaucracy and bloatedness in the public service and the way we do things.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Every position has to be reassessed in terms of what it delivers, within the context of objective criteria. It is a huge challenge but we are hopeful of meeting our targets.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - As the rand continues its shaky path and investor perceptions remain wary about the ability of the government to deliver on its ambitious macroeconomic plan, government officials are quietly and determinedly working to ensure that stringent budget-cutting targets are met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether the political implications will still upset the applecart remains to be seen, but the budget for 1997/98 is fast taking shape behind closed doors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The parliamentary finance committee heard this week that the finance department had already set total central and provincial government spending targets for the next budget, bearing in mind the plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">to achieve a 4% budget deficit by 1998.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">State Expenditure director general Hannes Smit said the budget committee would meet today (Friday) to finalise the figures, which would then be presented to Cabinet for approval before individual government departments are told of their allocations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, as the committee also heard from Public Service Commission deputy director general Fanie Visser, doing the actual downsizing on the ground in various departments to reduce spending was proving to be a difficult task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So much so, he said, that it had been suggested to departments to do a manual headcount of civil servants in a last-ditch attempt to find out exactly how many civil servants are on government's payroll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;balkanisation&quot; of South Africa under the apartheid regime had left a totally incomplete record of the number of staff who were paid by the state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A lot of people say there are ghosts in the system and finding out how many there are can only be done on a manual basis,&quot; said Public Service Commission special adviser John Ernstzen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to the fact that several provinces had reported that people not employed by the government were receiving state salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to some estimates, South Africa has 1,25- million national and provincial civil servants who will cost the country R64,1-billion in 1996/97.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Trade unions and the PSC have agreed that the civil service should be &quot; rightsized&quot; or &quot;downsized&quot; by anything up to 200 000 posts by 1997/98. This would be linked to salary improvements for the lowest paid and to retain skilled staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Ernstzen said this was not a simple matter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic South Africa in effect inherited 11 civil services from the apartheid state and its &quot;homelands&quot; or &quot;self-governing territories&quot; created for various black groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visser told the committee that although progress had been made in rationalising posts and weeding out duplications, officials were still trying to work out how many civil servants were needed to deliver services efficiently and effectively throughout the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was more difficult to pin down how many civil servants there were because computerised payroll and staff record systems had not yet been introduced countrywide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The figures that we receive from some provinces appear to be inaccurate,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Committee members said it was &quot;worrying&quot; that the latest figures from the Central Statistical Service (CSS) showed that the number of people employed by national government had increased from 572 000 in December 1995 to 587 000 in March 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Visser said he was not aware of this but would report back to the committee.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin this week tried to dispel allegations that the government was placing sensitive industries -- and jobs -- in jeopardy by fast-tracking tariff cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Briefing the parliamentary trade and industry committee, Erwin admitted that tariff cuts would take place in the clothing and textile industries more quickly than the World Trade Organisation (WTO) binding expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this had been decided on by the government, business and labour in the best interests of the industry as a whole.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the tariff issues are much more complex than they would appear to be on the surface,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In terms of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on tariffs and trade (gatt), binding rates on tariffs had to be cut by an average of 33% over three years for developed countries and five years for developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;South Africa was given five years, not because it is seen as a developing country but as an economy in transition,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's offer bound 99% of its tariffs, excluding oil and armaments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin said the situation was complicated by the fact that the Uruguay Round also required tariffs to convert protective measures such as high specific duties into ad valorem tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The binding rate offer we made to Uruguay was higher than the actual tariff at that time,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That meant there was not a great need to meet the new binding rate because the majority of products were already below the binding rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there was &quot;clearly some misunderstanding at times because people think we are bringing down tariffs massively,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They do not realise it is the binding rate and not the actual rate that is coming down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the clothing and textiles industries, South Africa managed, &quot;using a lot of negotiating pressure&quot;, to get a 12-year adjustment period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But when we began examining that industry more closely, we raised the possibility that if we do this over 12 years, we may end up without an industry if we are not careful,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was because most of the protection offered to these industries was through non-tariff measures such as specific duties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These would have to be removed within the next 12 years, if not before, and it was felt that it would be in the best interests to reduce tariffs over seven years rather than 12 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So in that sense, yes, it is faster than the Gatt that we had, but the reasons for it are mainly to try to allow the industry to restructure, recapitalise and retrain so that it can be effective,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The automotive industry was given eight years to reduce tariffs and the government had stuck to that timetable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So, it is a complex issue, but I want to state very clearly that any notion that we are somehow rapidly fast-tracking the tariff adjustment is not the case,&quot; Erwin said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The rand continued to breach new lows against the dollar and sterling this week, as the Reserve Bank fought to prevent an increase in interest rates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Governor Chris Stals said all government deposits, normally held with the Reserve Bank, would be placed with commercial banks, thereby taking the pressure off overnight lending rates. The money market shortage eased slightly to R8,6-billion thanks to the bank's intervention.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Now that the government has finally named its privatisation adviser, it transpires that the endless delays over the appointment stemmed in part from a political struggle over who will control restructuring and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The outcome of the battle appears to be that parastatals, and the government departments responsible for them, will have a greater say and the Public Enterprises Department a more supervisory -- or &quot;train-station&quot; -- role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the government said Simpson McKie HSBC (a tie-up between the local stockbrokers and international banking group HSBC) had won the prized R10-million, one-year contract -- put out to tender last year -- to help it reshape policy on shaking up state assets. Some commentators have expressed surprise at the choice; a recent Euromoney privatisation poll does not even list HSBC in the top 10 sell-off specialists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The R10-million is seen as a relatively small amount -- indeed this week the public enterprises department indicated it was keen to up the amount and therefore the size of the role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advisers will report to Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau.  Although they will advise on all restructuring and privatisation, parastatals and the online ministries such as Transport and Mineral and Energy Affairs will be able to appoint their own advisers. Telkom already has, in the form of Goldman Sachs, and Post and Telecommunications is preparing to do the same.  Simpson McKie will clearly not be allowed to execute transactions, a job that will be left to banks hired by individual parastatals or ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say both the heads of parastatals and some online ministries would have been keen to prolong the appointment as long as possible to give themselves room to manoeuvre. They might also have been keen to limit Sigcau's advisers' role to give themselves as much as lee-way as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Evidence of the tension within government over the issue is the struggle concerning Transnet between Transport Minister Mac Maharaj and Sigcau. The parastatal falls into both ministers' domains and the struggle has at times spilled over into the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As far as parastatals are concerned, it appears their various bosses have very different approaches and might want to be as free from government control as possible. Behind the fuzz of carefully worded statements on privatisation and restructuring it appears Transnet's preparations for privatisation are, for example, burdened by its massive pension fund deficit and allegations of corruption. Some senior Eskom officials, however, are believed to be quite keen on privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over the past year, there have been several instances of parastatal management attempting to push ahead with privatisation and restructuring plans with little effort to consult the government. Mossgas management came under fire from the Chemical Workers Industrial Union for pushing through a hefty belt-tightening programme ahead of a possible sale. There were also claims that state diamond company Alexkor was beavering away at a privatisation drive with little consultation with either the government or the unions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last month, Business Map disclosed that management at the government's loss- making holiday resort chain Aventura had come up with a detailed privatisation plan after discussions with the unions. The plan, drawn up with consultant Price Waterhouse, involved selling 75% of Aventura on the open market, 23% to employees and 2% to current workers as a gratuity. Business Map said the proposed sale price is R70- million to R80-million for all 15 resorts -- R50- million for settling debt and sprucing up the resorts and R20- million for the workers' trust. The scheme means the government gets no money from the sale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Business Map argued a number of objectives of the sale were murky -- in particular, why there was no attempt to cash in on Aventura's potential as a vehicle for black economic empowerment; the inclusion of management in the employee trust which apparently secured its position; and how the sale price was worked out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The case study was used by Business Map to examine how the government and the unions are faring on squeezing the most out of privatisation. The body said the unions had adopted a vague, rhetorical approach to the issue, but the government was not blameless -- several key ministers failed to turn up at privatisation meetings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One observer close to the process told the Mail &amp; Guardian that although various ministers and parastatal bosses would have been keen to stall the process, Sigcau's team was not skilful enough to use the appointment process to strengthen its power base. Most observers are unflattering of Sigcau's performance on privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Simpson McKie HSBC said this week its role would involve helping the government to review the plans suggested by various sectoral task teams on privatisation, prioritise these objectives, examine the existing regulatory framework for state assets and develop a communication strategy that will keep all &quot;stakeholders abreast of developments&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - THe organisers say that the Atlanta Games will &quot;break even&quot;.  Well, that's all right then. President Bill Clinton said: &quot;They were the greatest Games in the history of the Olympics.&quot; Fine. But for those whose priorities are neither fiscal nor political, and whose reputation does not depend on a chorus of domestic approval, the tournament was saved -- as ever - - only by the athletes and the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In many other respects the Atlanta Games lived down to the reservations held for them by Dick Pound, the outspoken Internationl Olympic Committee member, who described the gathering as a &quot;flea market&quot;. The Olympic ideal is dead and buried, as if we ever thought it would survive the manipulation of capitalism in full flow.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is disingenuous to pretend that the thousands of tacky stalls, a tidal wave of crude sponsorship, the unrelenting hard-sell during the Games and a quite astounding &quot;fire sale&quot; of athletes and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infrastructure last week, could leave the world with any other impression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two stories paint the picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kerri Strug, the pixie who thrilled us with her bravery on the vault and then squeakily renounced her earlier commitment to remain amateur, is being marketed as a grotesque parody of herself. It might not seem so to her agent, Leigh Steinberg, but his rumoured efforts to negotiate the sale of Kerri Strug dolls is surely a joke too far. Can he not hear the sniggering asides: why don't they just put a key in her back, wind her up and be done with it?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strug and her American teammates went on the road this week to cash in on their team gold medal, and the unease that some people have about these remarkable, doll-like creatures grows. They have been transformed from athletes into sideshow oddities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other story is about an Italian company called Mondo, who paid Acog $6- million for the right to put down the super-fast Sportflex Super-X track at the new Olympic Stadium. A string of world records and the resulting heightened interest satisfied the organisers, not to mention NBC -- that the surface was murder on the muscles and joints of all but the sprinters did not merit reflection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mondo did doubly well out of the deal. They had also bought the rights to sell half of the track in 100 000 pieces. Already they have had 1 000 orders; and the most hilarious carve-up is to come -- the finish line is to be auctioned off, with a reserve of $25 000 expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of money generated by the Olympics is almost impossible to calculate and since the closing ceremony elite athletes have joined the organisers in the cash orgy as they deal with the big hitters from Madison Avenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Michael Johnson has universally been declared the major winner, followed by Strug, decathlete Dan O'Brien, Carl Lewis, softball heroine and doctor Dot Richardson, basketball star Lisa Leslie and swimmer Amy Van Dyken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is there something significant about this list? They are all Americans.  Visiting champions are obviously of no marketable use to a domestic audience so primed on glory during three weeks of near- hysterical, televised xenophobia. Perhaps those who doubted outside scepticism about the ethical foundations of this jamboree will see now where it was all leading: from the podium to the bank. As IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch was hanging gold medals around the necks of winners, some were calculating the conversion of a bauble into real money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At least Americans are candid about the marriage of myth and moolah. Sean Brenner, of Team Marketing Report, says of Michael Johnson: &quot;He accomplished an unprecedented athletic feat. But the big surprise is how personable he showed himself to be.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports marketer Marty Blackman, of Blackman and Faber, says of O'Brien: &quot; He's the one athlete who could literally be compared with Superman.&quot; He means &quot;literally&quot;; O'Brien is reduced to a cartoon character. Another sports marketer, Stephen Disson, says loftily of Lewis: &quot;People wrote him off, but he showed incredible emotion when he went for that jump.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There you have it: the next time you watch a renowned sports star, make a note of his or her demeanour, the glib aside, the winning wink. What you are seeing is the ultimate flowering of that late 20th century phenomenon: the whoring of sport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the marketing of muscle, the selling of perceived charisma. Neither is necessarily linked to physical prowess -- unless you count facial calisthenics, fluttering eyelashes or calculated sneers alongside hamstrings and pecs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chris Eubank would have made a great Olympian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unsophisticated interlopers, like the Russian wrestling legend, Aleksandr Karelin, generally don't make it. After a trial with the Dallas Cowboys last week, Karelin was left hanging on the end of the phone for a reply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said a Cowboys coach: &quot;Just an amazing athlete, huge arms, huge legs, just an incredible end tackle. But he was looking for large numbers of roubles.&quot; What a cheek.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If only Karelin would smile more -- or growl, even -- he might end up on the Wheaties packet, the space coveted by every American gold medallist. If only he had an agent like Arliss the character in a TV series of the same name. A mythical sports agent only slightly larger than life, he arranges for a baseball star to sell his bodily fluids on a TV home shopping channel, succumbs to the seduction techniques of a teenaged tennis pro (an episode which veteran commentator Bud Collins said &quot;was right on the nose&quot;), and generally plays the game behind the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few hundred, of course, of the 10 000 competitors or so who came to Georgia got into bed with the Arlisses. Most went home poorer in pocket and richer in spirit. While the elite have prospered beyond all previous reckoning, perhaps the real winners were those who missed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile 12 nights after the bomb that killed Alice Hawthorne, a magnificent electrical storm whip- cracked through the deserted high-rise canyons of downtown Atlanta. It flashed and boomed, a torrent of menacing, cleansing fury -- the sort of biblical metaphor that Jesus-lovin' Georgians devour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That's how Mark Twain (who knew the South and its religious fervour well) might have had it. But the parable is flawed. There was no retribution, no wrong righted. Divine judgment was not delivered on a vain and sinful city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was just a river of rain to wash over the muck and tat of commercial excess that had clogged the streets of Atlanta for the 17 days of the tackiest Olympic Games of modern times -- whatever Bill Clinton says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Round</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">two of the Premier Soccer League (PSL) comes up this weekend with clubs hoping for more goals and spectators and fewer red cards and armed robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yes, just when you thought the sports pages were a safe haven from the crime engulfing the country, along comes an armed gang to relieve Manning Rangers of more than R7 000 in gate receipts at Chatsworth Stadium. To make matters worse for the Durban club, while they were losing the takings from a derby against Amazulu off the field, the team were going down 2-0 to their fiercest rivals on it. Italian fans may be used to nine matches producing a miserly 11 goals, but action-loving South African audiences expect the net to bulge with far greater frequency.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Talking of audiences, where were all the fans last weekend? About 15 000 watched a Coca-Cola Challenge Cup encounter between Rangers and Amazulu, but less than half that number turned up for the real thing (no pun intended).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An even bigger shock awaited Orlando Pirates, Kaizer Chiefs, Moroka Swallows and Jomo Cosmos at FNB Stadium, where only 35 000 turned up for an attractive double-header.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Let me to hasten to add that the figures from Port Elizabeth, Pietersburg and Bloemfontein were more encouraging, although those who tried to attack Celtic coach Stanley Phiri clearly do not belong at such a civilised gathering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manny Rodrigues (Cape Town Spurs), Samkelo Jam Jam (Jomo Cosmos) and Pollen Ndlanya (Kaizer Chiefs) were the red-card offenders with Rodrigues's first dismissal also being the first of the PSL. Given all the hype surrounding the launch of the league (&quot;The greatest event in South African soccer history&quot; deserved a red card of its own for going over the top), it was entirely natural that events could backfire. One suspects that PSL chief executive officer Trevor Phillips, the Englishman imported to get the show on the road at a salary varying from R40 000 to R80 000 a month depending on whom you read, is simply relieved that the show is now on the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vehicle certainly needs considerable fine tuning, but that should come as no surprise, given that the engineer had only two weeks to build it. The weekend programme begins in Cape Town on Friday night with Hellenic hosting Real Rovers, who snatched a late home victory over Sundowns through another goal from consistent scorer George Mathiba. Normally poor travellers, Rovers held Chiefs and Pirates in Johannesburg lately and pipped Hellenic by the odd goal in seven at Greenpoint Stadium when they clashed in the pre-season Challenge Cup. Colin Gie, coach of the Greek Gods, would have preferred the match on the wider Athlone Stadium surface as his young team try to build on a goalless deadlock with neighbours Spurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pick of the three Saturday matches is the Wits- Pirates showdown at Rand Stadium, which The Students wisely moved from compact Milpark to cater for an expected large crowd.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A solitary goal from Jerry Sikosana separated these teams in the Challenge Cup, and Wits will be quietly confident of exacting revenge, having held Moroka Swallows and Vaal Professionals goalless in enemy territory. The Buccaneers are suffering from understandable tiredness triggered by too many matches in too little time and the problem of poor finishing can only be exacerbated by the lengthy loss through injury of recent signing Gerald Stober.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If Milpark was too small for Pirates, it was big enough for Swallows, who had to move their fixture against Rangers because Ellis Park is being prepared for the South Africa-All Blacks rugby Test. Sorry to be such a nuisance to you good PSL officials, but considering the rugby date was known months ago, was it necessary to pencil in Ellis Park at all?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both clubs are licking their wounds following first- round defeats, so a lively tussle is predicted between teams capable of playing excellent passing games.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supersport United were forced to postpone their debut at Pretoria Technikon due to campus unrest, so it is off to Odi Stadium for a match against off- the-boil Cape Town Spurs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not that the boys sponsored by the channel of champions can afford to be complacent as they had the better of exchanges with the Eagles in a previous encounter this year only to fall in the final minute. Chiefs may have been unimpressive winners over Cosmos through a late goal from Thabang Lebese, but who remembers how the three points were won when the season ends?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opponents Celtic come to Johannesburg Stadium on Sunday seeking to recapture the form which propelled them to fourth place on the final Challenge Cup standings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Home losses to Sundowns and QwaQwa Stars were compounded by the midweek resignation of Zambian Phiri after police had to save him from hot heads at Clive Solomon Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">QwaQwa Stars and Bush Bucks will be seeking third consecutive victories when they meet at</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Phuthaditjhaba, the soccer venue that can get your tongue twisted very quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goal-shy outfits Sundowns and Vaal Professionals seek a better return on investments at Odi Stadium and in Port Elizabeth, pre-season relegation favourites Michau Warriors and Witbank Aces clash. Amazulu, the only club to manage a victory by more than one goal in the opening round, host Cosmos, an outfit whose emphasis on youth is matched only by its unpredictability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the weekend, Mandela informed the ANC's national executive committee that he would not make himself available for another term as the party's leader in December 1997, when elections are held for the next three-year term of office for office bearers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee, the highest decision making body of the ANC, also confirmed that in addition Mandela had formally announced that he would not be available for re-election as president of South Africa. His term of office expires in 1999, when the next democratic general elections are to be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee said that it respected Mandela's decision, and also expressed its profound appreciation for the sterling service he had rendered to both the party and the country in a lifetime of struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed ANC sources are of the opinion that Mandela's decision is likely to open the door to deputy president Thabo Mbeki to take over as president of the party in 1997, and possibly become the country's leader in 1999.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK - The United States' plan to find a replacement for the United Nations secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, before the American presidential elections in November, may be facing some resistance in the Security Council, a U.S. newspaper has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influential New York Times reported Monday that the council, on whose recommendation the appointment of the secretary-general is made by the General Assembly, was not as keen as the U.S. to discuss the issue now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Tono Eitel, Germany's representative at the UN and this month's security council president, polled delegations in recent days, he found only one, the American, that wanted to schedule a debate on the issue any time soon,&quot; the newspaper reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that the consensus among the 14 other members of the council was that there was no urgency to act, &quot;in part because a secretary-general has usually been chosen later in the year and in part because the Clinton administration, with its record of policy shifts, may change its mind after the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali has said he will seek re-election when his current five-year term expires on Dec. 31, but the U.S., which accuses him of not having carried out enough reform at the UN, has promised to veto his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. has made its position clear, and therefore people who think that we might change our minds are wrong,&quot; the paper quoted the U.S. permanent representative at the UN, Madeleine Albright, as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albright said that countries that insisted on supporting Boutros-Ghali, &quot; rather than working to find a candidate who is somebody who will have the general confidence not only of the U.S. but others, should understand that the American decision is irrevocable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the reasons we made the decision when we did was to allow other candidates to come forward,&quot; she said, adding: &quot;I think that it is a little bit irresponsible not to be more active for other council members in terms of trying to figure out how the process ought to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times reported that the U.S. government's efforts to belittle Boutros-Ghali's achievements, and its warning to UN staff members not to use their positions to campaign for his re-election, had generated new sympathy for the secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organisation of African Unity, the League of Arab nations and China, among others, have also expressed their support for the secretary-general's re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 73-year-old Egyptian diplomat is the first African UN secretary-general.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland - Swazi communities living in the construction site for a dam have expressed fear that the bones of their deceased relatives may be stolen and used for ritual purposes, when the graves are moved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The graves will be moved as part of a resettlement programme to give way for the Maguga dam in north-west Swaziland.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting held at Timphisini at the weekend, ministry of agriculture officials explained that the resettlement of communities to be affected by the Maguga dam and the enlargement of the Driekopis dam on the South African side of the border was necessary to prevent eventual spill-overs during floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The concerned villagers have called on the government to provide police protection during the exhumations as well as sacrificial beasts to be slaughtered by the affected families to appease the dead, the Times of Swaziland reported Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Maguga and Driekopis dams projects are part of a billion rand (over a quarter million U.S. dollars) Komati River basin development scheme which will open up large areas in northern Swaziland and across the South African border for agricultural and agro-industrial development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two governments will share the costs of the project with South Africa, providing three-fifths and Swaziland two-fifths.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa's national airline is reportedly giving serious consideration to halting some of its regular international routes. South African Airways (SAA), one of the continent's top air transport companies, is said to be moving into the red this year in the face of stiff foreign competition.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senior Public Relations Manager, Leon Els, has confirmed that a drop of up to 10 percent this year in passenger numbers has led to an investigation into the airline's less profitable international routes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said no decision had been taken as yet on which routes might be discontinued, but he did confirm that 30 of the airline's pilots had been contracted out to far eastern airlines. More pilots may be contracted out in the future, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline is also believed to be considering the possibility of cutting back on the nine new aircraft it ordered from Boeing in 1995, or at least postponing the acquisition of some of the aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA sources have indicated that the number of aircraft could be cut, or some of them could be leased rather than purchased, as a result of the current tight financial situation in which the airline finds itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major reason for this situation is the fact that the South African Rand has lost 25 percent of its value against the American dollar in the past six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that the ordered aircraft would cost SAA considerably more than the 3.5 billion South African Rand budgeted for early in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, much stronger international competition has pushed SAA into a loss situation for the first quarter of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no official confirmation of the extent of the loss, but some unofficial estimates claim it could be as much as 23 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">equivalent of 244,000 U.S dollars locally for the World Solar Summit scheduled to be held in Harare on September 16 and 17 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, whose goal is to promote worldwide utilization of solar energy and other renewable sources of energy to generate electricity, is expected to cost 9.4 million dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The World Solar Summit fund-raising committee's chairman, Peter Pamire, said the amount was contributed by several local companies and unnamed donors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that some foreign donors -- Saudi Arabia, Spain, the European Union, Indonesia, Austria and Denmark -- have pledged a total of 750,000 dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe government still needs to raise an additional 4.1 million dollars to host the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will spend about 4.3 million dollars to purchase vehicles for the summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pamire urged Zimbabweans and other people to donate towards the summit to ensure it is a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The summit is...about handing over a usable environment for our future generations. I want to re-emphasize that it is small monies that make the big monies, so I would like to appeal to people to donate whatever amounts they can afford,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 200 heads of state and government and heads of international organizations and institutions have been invited to attend the summit being co-organized with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South Africa has come out strongly against the latest United States government action against Cuba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Foreign Minister, Aziz Pahad, has criticized United States legislation tightening the economic embargo against Fidel Castro's regime, underlining the fact that Cuba offers excellent business opportunities for South African companies.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Nelson Mandela has gone on record in the past, saying that South Africa would not abandon its old friends to suit American wishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that Cuba was one of the few countries to support his African National Congress during its armed struggle against Pretoria's apartheid regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African leader has issued an invitation to his Cuban counterpart to pay an official state visit to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pahad said South Africa has discussed the new anti-Cuban legislation with European and Latin-American countries. &quot;We agree with the general position,&quot; he added, &quot;that this is a bad law, and we have expressed our opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was announced earlier this week that another large group of Cuban doctors is scheduled to arrive in South Africa later this month to assist with health care in the rural areas of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Luangwa - Villagers in Janeiro area of Chief Mpuka's area in Luangwa, have resorted to killing some elephants after growing tired of sending reports about the unruly beasts to the department of wildlife without who, however, failed to impose any control measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One such elephant was today found dead, about a hundred metres away from Chamitondo wildlife camp after being shot in the chest once by unknown people the previous night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimitondo camp officer in charge, Green Mundia, that the animal had been shot at night and they had tried to trek its foot prints to establish where it had been shot from but could not come up with any results as many elephants had stampeded the area during the night.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We had heard three gun shots in the night, around 01:00 hours and in the morning a boy who was going to cut poles reported to us that he had found an elephant sleeping just near the camp. But when we went there we discovered that it was actually dead'', explained Scout Mundia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had sent a report to the ranger in charge of the area and was waiting for orders to dispose off the meat since villagers were up in arms with them for not controlling the animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Village headman Janeiro, flanked by three other headmen, Mbilisau, Kaombo and Chaulu said their subjects had suffered enough and would not go on with it like that without any action from the officers responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The headmen lamented that they were not happy that their subjects had resorted to such action as killing the animals themselves without permission from the government but however appealed to the government to urgently look into their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''We have stopped going to our fields now because of this same problem as the hunter that was sent here has now taken to drinking only,'' he moaned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Government has pledged to support the book industry in the country to further enhance educational levels, education permanent, secretary Dr Sichalwe Kasanda said today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kasanda said at the national book policy symposium that the ministry of education is fully committed to support useful developments that contribute to strenghthening of the educational system.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two-day symposium is being held at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre under the auspices of the Zambia Commission for UNESCO and will pave way for the formation of a national policy and the book development council of Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officially opening the symposium, Dr Kasanda said the formation of a national book policy in Zambia is long overdue and that the ministry has taken due care to embrace all the needs of the stakeholders in order to come- up with the policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kasanda regretted however that Zambia is currently under a moribund state as regards the book industry which has kept the country in a state of intellectual isolation from the rest of the world, a situation he described as unfortunate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has commended Zambia for the strides it has taken in formultaing a national book policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNESCO programme specialist in education Dr Mauno Mbamba from Harare said Zambia is the first country among the five in the sub-region that participated in a study for textbook provision in 1993 which has formulated a national book policy to further develop the book industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other countries are Zimbabwe, Namibia, Malawi and Bostwana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Mbamba appealed to the stakeholders to ensure that all essential elements of a national book policy including the collection of baseline data, research, interests of authors, publishers and printers are addressed so that the policy is a success.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The liberalisation of the economy and opening up of the market to free competition has forced many companies to look towards exporting as a way of survival and increasing capacity utilisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) chairman, Mr Kambidima Wotela, said this in Lusaka today when he officially opened an eight-month integrated export management training programme to take place for the first time in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Wotela who expressed sadness at the little attention paid in Zambia to specialised and practical training in export management said exporting had more challenges than selling on the domestic market.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is usually lack of knowledge on the market and consumer behaviour while there is stiff competition from all over the world. The further one is from the market place, therefore, the more complex the marketing problems,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was for this reason that the EBZ approached the European Union for assistance in establishing a training programme which would look at the practical side of exporting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the board has in the past run short courses in some aspects of export market and has worked closely with the human resource development project under USAID in undertaking management training programme for small scale business enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This export management training programme has been designed after extensive consultation with Zambia's export companies and potential exporters.  The programme is, therefore, a true reflection of the training needs of Zambian companies,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at the same function, EBZ acting executive director, Mr Johnson Mwenya said the training programme was necessary because more rapid expansion of non-traditional exports which the Zambian economy needs to support its development objectives required high quality export and business skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in regional and wider international markets competition was intense and exporters must be sufficiently skilled to cope with the competition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the course of the weekend, Mandela informed the ANC's national executive committee that he would not make himself available for another term as the party's leader in December 1997, when elections are held for the next three-year term of office for office bearers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee, the highest decision making body of the ANC, also confirmed that in addition Mandela had formally announced that he would not be available for re-election as president of South Africa. His term of office expires in 1999, when the next democratic general elections are to be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The committee said that it respected Mandela's decision, and also expressed its profound appreciation for the sterling service he had rendered to both the party and the country in a lifetime of struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Informed ANC sources are of the opinion that Mandela's decision is likely to open the door to deputy president Thabo Mbeki to take over as president of the party in 1997, and possibly become the country's leader in 1999.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK (PANA) - The United States' plan to find a replacement for the United Nations secretary-general, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, before the American presidential elections in November, may be facing some resistance in the Security Council, a U.S. newspaper has reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The influential New York Times reported Monday that the council, on whose recommendation the appointment of the secretary-general is made by the General Assembly, was not as keen as the U.S. to discuss the issue now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When Tono Eitel, Germany's representative at the UN and this month's security council president, polled delegations in recent days, he found only one, the American, that wanted to schedule a debate on the issue any time soon,&quot; the newspaper reported.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It added that the consensus among the 14 other members of the council was that there was no urgency to act, &quot;in part because a secretary-general has usually been chosen later in the year and in part because the Clinton administration, with its record of policy shifts, may change its mind after the elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boutros-Ghali has said he will seek re-election when his current five-year term expires on Dec. 31, but the U.S., which accuses him of not having carried out enough reform at the UN, has promised to veto his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. has made its position clear, and therefore people who think that we might change our minds are wrong,&quot; the paper quoted the U.S. permanent representative at the UN, Madeleine Albright, as saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Albright said that countries that insisted on supporting Boutros-Ghali, &quot; rather than working to find a candidate who is somebody who will have the general confidence not only of the U.S. but others, should understand that the American decision is irrevocable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the reasons we made the decision when we did was to allow other candidates to come forward,&quot; she said, adding: &quot;I think that it is a little bit irresponsible not to be more active for other council members in terms of trying to figure out how the process ought to work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The New York Times reported that the U.S. government's efforts to belittle Boutros-Ghali's achievements, and its warning to UN staff members not to use their positions to campaign for his re-election, had generated new sympathy for the secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Organisation of African Unity, the League of Arab nations and China, among others, have also expressed their support for the secretary-general's re-election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 73-year-old Egyptian diplomat is the first African UN secretary-general.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a meeting held at Timphisini at the weekend, ministry of agriculture officials explained that the resettlement of communities to be affected by the Maguga dam and the enlargement of the Driekopis dam on the South African side of the border was necessary to prevent eventual spill-overs during floods.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (PANA) - South Africa's national airline is reportedly giving serious consideration to halting some of its regular international routes. South African Airways (SAA), one of the continent's top air transport companies, is said to be moving into the red this year in the face of stiff foreign competition. The Senior Public Relations Manager, Leon Els, has confirmed that a drop of up to 10 percent this year in passenger numbers has led to an investigation into the airline's less profitable international routes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said no decision had been taken as yet on which routes might be discontinued, but he did confirm that 30 of the airline's pilots had been contracted out to far eastern airlines. More pilots may be contracted out in the future, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The airline is also believed to be considering the possibility of cutting back on the nine new aircraft it ordered from Boeing in 1995, or at least postponing the acquisition of some of the aircraft.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SAA sources have indicated that the number of aircraft could be cut, or some of them could be leased rather than purchased, as a result of the current tight financial situation in which the airline finds itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major reason for this situation is the fact that the South African Rand has lost 25 percent of its value against the American dollar in the past six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This means that the ordered aircraft would cost SAA considerably more than the 3.5 billion South African Rand budgeted for early in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, much stronger international competition has pushed SAA into a loss situation for the first quarter of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There has been no official confirmation of the extent of the loss, but some unofficial estimates claim it could be as much as 23 million U.S dollars.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The summit, whose goal is to promote worldwide utilization of solar energy and other renewable sources of energy to generate electricity, is expected to cost 9.4 million dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe government still needs to raise an additional 4.1 million dollars to host the summit.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Despite concerted efforts to lure more patrons, Nigeria's capital market remains unattractive to many firms and of limited benefit to listed companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All over the world, the capital market is known for the big boast it gives listed firms which, in turn, entices others to rush to enlist on the stock exchange. Nigeria might as well be an exception. After more thatn 30 years of its operation, the Nigerian Stock Exchange has listed just 183 companies in the primary and secondary markets. Worse, a chunk of these firms are Nigerian subsidiaries of traditional institutions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The listing of indigenous firms on The Exchange is grindingly low. Compared to what obtains in other developing economies, Nigeria's is yet to register its mark. For example, there are well over 500 quoted firms in the South African Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of about $300 billion while Chile's capitalization is above the $100 billion mark. In comparisoon, Nigeria's 183 quoted firms' capitalization is straggling at less than $2 billion, the equivalent of just one medium-sized firm in a developed economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An illustration of how slowly Nigerians are taking their companies to the capital market could be seen in the fact that for all of this year, just two firms -- Lonman Publishers and African Paints -- have been listed on The Exchange. Even to chronic optimist, the figure is baffling, considering that the repeal of the much vilified Exchanged Control Act of 1962 in January of last year and the promulgation of the supposedly private sector-friendly Investment Promotion Commission Decree eight months later was expected to literally force company owners to take their firms to the public. Thinking was that quoted firms would benefit tremedously from foreign investment funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two major reasons have been adduced for this disappointingly low patronage of the Exchange by Nigerian enterprises, of which Corporate Affairs Commission says it has already registered a little over a million. Many argue that it costs a fortune to source for funds in the capital market. African Paints, Plc, one of the latest entrants into the market, discovered this as soon as it got listed. On July 30 when the shares of the company were formally listed, Gbenga Akinnawo, chairman and chief executive of the company, said he coughed out a staggering N15 million of the N75 million he went to raise as sundry charges. He lamented that &quot;the capital market which is supposed to be a source for cheap funds is having its funds priced above the money market rate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The various charges go to the Securities and the Exchange Commission, the Nigerian Stock Exchange, brokerage firms, issuing houses and other third parties such as solicitors and accounting firms. This is in addition to the mandatory stamp duty of .00025 per cent of total share value. It is probably due to this outcry that SEC has begun a campaign for the reduction of the percentage of the charges. May 20, SEC reduced its percentage charge on securities worth N500 million and below from 1.5 per cent to one per cent.  The George Akamiokhor-led SEC said the reduction was &quot;targeted at the small and medium-scale industries with a view to attracting them to seek quotation on The Nigerian Stock Exchange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission is also currently negotiating with the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers with a view to reducing the brokers fee from the current three per cent of the total value sought. It is hoped that this wil entice more firms to the capital market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, many analyst still argue that in the long run, it is still cheaper to source funds from the capital market than from the money market. Abiodun Akinsola, managing partner of Bond Consulting, a financial consultancy, argues that funds from the capital market are for long term investments. He maintains that &quot;the advantage to the borrower (company) is that the lender (shareholder) has a stake in the company,&quot; and that fees paid in the process are once and for all while &quot;interest&quot; is paid in the form of dividend only when the company makes profit. In contrast, profit or not, interest on funds from the money market must still be paid along with the principal. What this means, says Akinsola, is that the money market advantageous for short term purposes. Akinsola traced Nigerians' slow dance to the capital market to their reluctance to give up control of their firms no matter their financial state. &quot;Nigerians,&quot; he said, &quot;rebuff economics of scale due to our basic orientation to business which is that we prefer to have absolute control of the businesss. The saying that Nigerians would rather rule in hell than serve in heaven is pointedly true of our businessmen.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps, the country's business tycoons need to carefully read the stories of their foreign counterparts before deciding to embrace the bitter-sweet pill of capitalism.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - The disruption of the party registration exercise and moves to make politicians start afresh heighten tension in political circles and create doubts about what the designs of the government are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It came too sudden and too soon. Barely five days inot the much-awaited verifcation of the claims submitted by the 18 political associations seeking registration as parties, an order from the headquarters of the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria suddenly halted the exercise. According to reports, the order came from Sumner Dagogo-Jack, NECON chairman, directing state administrative secretaries to recall all the field officers back to the state headquarters for a reverification of data so far obtained by them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since no definite reason was given for the suspension, speculations soon started making the rounds. One report had it that the order to suspend the exercise originated from the presidency, which was purportedly irked abut reports from security agents indicting NECON officials at the local government level fro allegedly extorting money from politicians so as to present favourable reports of their claims. Another suggested that the verification exercise ran into a storm as NECON officials found out that &quot; some mistakes were discovered in the sorting and distribution of claims of political associations.&quot; The temporary suspension would, therefore, enable the electoral body to correct the mistakes discovered in the field. The latter report was credited to Steve Osemeke, NECON chief spokesman.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More conflicting information was to come from the commission last week. In one of the several reactions from the headquarters in Abuja, Ibrahim Biu, the deputy director of public affairs, denied that the verifiation exercise was ever suspended. He said: &quot;As far as we are concerned, our men are still on the field. You can see for yourself, the commission's (office) is still empty.  &quot; The drama got to a height on Monday when Dagogo-Jack and the seven national sommissioners in charge of the zones held a four-hour meeting with officials of the presidency in Abuja. The meeting continued on Tuesday, with the Transition Implementation Committee holding yet another meeting the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek, however, gathered that the suspension was at the instance of the government. A top government official whose portfolio is related to security matters is said to be the motivator of the events that led to the suspension of the verification exercise. The man credited to be the brain behind the emergence of the United National Congress, UNC, which is now the behemoth among the political associations, was eventually able to convince Sani Abacha, the head of state, that security reports had indicated that the verification exercisie by NECON would end in stalemate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To win over Abacha, the smooth operator claimed that only the UNCP has the spread and machinery to scale the registration hurdles. This reality, he said, would finally lead government having no option than to dismiss the entire registration process and then resort to creating parties fiat as was done in the Babangida era. He suggested that the head of state should order NECON to halt the registration exercise and then call for a review of the NECON guidelines with provisions for the 18 associations to merge and create &quot;very few broad-based political groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After listening to the security chief, Abacha summoned Mamman Nasir, chairman of the TLC, Dagogo-Jack, Hammas, the political adviser to the head of state, and Didado Idris, secretary to the government of the federation, to a meeting on Friday, August 9. At the meeting, the security chief eas told to present his argument before everyone. After he had done that, Nasir picked a hole in the argument that only UNCP would meet the NECON guidelines and therefore should be a model for other associations to copy. The TIC chief argued that there is no legal basis for the recognition of any group known as UNCP as its constituent groups submitted registration materials on individual basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was at this point that the head of state recommended that the presidency, NECON and TIC should harmonise their positions and make recommendations to the government. But before last Monday when the meeting was scheduled to hold, the security chief had instigated NECON to produce a position paper supporting his views. The NECOn paper predicated its recommendations on the preliminary reports of its field officers and then argued that only a merger plan would save the registration exercise. It was the NECON paper that formed the nucleus of deliberations at last Monday's meeting which also extended till the following day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek learnt that by Wednesday when TIC met to ratify the new decisions with presidency officials, it had been agreed that the registration exercise would start afresh.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reviewed guidelines announced last Thursday by Dagogo-Jack gives all the associations 14 days to go and merge along similarity of ideology and programme of action. The merging groups will then have to submit the name of their new association, the manifesto, constitution and symbols to NECON.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also expected to furnish NECON with the names of all the officers at the national, state and local government levels. All the materials are to get to NECON by August 29. NECON will announce the approved mergers between August 30 and 31. The verification exercise would commence on September 2 and end on the 17th. The announcement on which parties to be registered will be made in October.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The proposal on merger at the instance of government confirmed earlier reports by Theweek that the government is at the head of the current drive by many political associations to fuse for the purpose of creating braod-based political associations. Sources disclosed that the government is instigating groups with similar ideological coloration and whose sponsors have had long- time association to come together. It is as a result of this effort of government that the United Nigerian Congress, the United Nigeria Party and the Soldiarity Group of Nigeria and the Grassroots Democratic Movement have also merged. That the government is interested on this alliance is not in doubt. Sources say that government officials have mounted pressure on Umaru Shinkafi, a chieftain of the All Nigeria Congress, to join the DPN. Part of the calculation of this lobby is that the ANC will not be registered since its sponsors have not been responding to calls for them to merger with groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek learnt that government is already suggesting that promoters of the People's Progressive Party should merge with their colleagues in the Social Progressive Party and the Progressive Party of Nigeria. The suggestion has not borne fruit because of the schism among top members of the associations based on their conflicting roles in the events following the annulled June 12, 1993 presidential elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ultimate aim of the government is that three broad-based parties representing the left, right and centre of the political spectrum should emerge. Government is already thinking that a minimum of three parties and a maximum of five should be announced, possibly in the presidential broadcast of Ocotober 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reactions of politicians on the various manoeuvres on the registration exercise differ. Chris Okolie of the Committee for National Consensus feigned ignorance of the suspension of the verification exercise. He said last week that reports from the northeast and northwest zones of the party indicated that &quot;if anything, NECON officials have not only visited local government headquarters, they have also extended the exercise up to the wards, thereby make it more rigorous.&quot; Okolie, however, insisted that the new attempt at reviewing the guidelines is belated and bound to lead to more confusion. &quot; Merger groups was not part of the guidelines that NECON gave us, &quot; said he. &quot; Parties have worked to satisfy current and subsisting guidelines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Olorunfunmi Bashorun, Okolie's opposite number in People's Consensus Party, was more vociferous in his rejection of the new efforts of government. He fumed: &quot;If it is true that there is such proposal, then the government can be rightly said to be sponsoring associations because there is no justification for a second guideline if there is no plan to assist weak associations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jimmy Imo of the PPP spoke in the same vein. He likened the new scenario to a teacher resetting the examination question after the students had submitted their answer scripts to await the result. &quot;Are they saying they are going to change the rule of the game in the middle of the game?&quot; he asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Kenny Martins of the Nation Builders Congress would rather &quot;wait and let NECON make clarifications on what is happening before making logical deductions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The &quot;clarifications&quot; have finally come, and much earlier than expected. For already stretched politicians who now have to return to the drawing board against their wish, that is naother reason to be sad.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - The administration proposes to sack all striking lecturers and close down the universities for one academic year. Who will flunk this test of wills?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At first it looked like a joke. It had all started last March 25 when the Academic Staff Union of Universities, exasperated by government's rebuff of their campaign for implementation of the 1992 agreement with ASUU, embarked on a series of warning strikes to force the authorities to the roundtable.  Ignored by Mohammed Liman, the Minister of Education, the lecturers went on a full blown strike April 9. Rather than negotiate the September 3, 1992 agreement, scheduled to be reviewed after three years, the government chose to repudiate it. More than that, it refused to enter into any dialogue on the issues of autonomy for, and better funding of, the universities, as demanded by ASUU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ASUU, on its part, ignored government orders to return to work. Withdrawal of recognition from the national ASUU did not compel the lecturers to heed government's instruction to negotiated locally with the various univeristy governing councils. Not even moves by vice-chancellors to stop the pay of the striking lecturers as directed by government could do the trick. While some lecturers reportedly indicatd interest in returning to work, a majority continued to reaffirm confidence in the ASUU national executive led by Asisi Asobie, insisting that government should negotiate with it.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last weeek, there were hints that the administration might have exhausted its patience. Top-level sources told Theweek that government had made up its mind to come down hard on the &quot;recalcitrant&quot; lecturers. The sources said that government was considering a mass sack of the lecturers and closure of the country's 39 universities for one academic session.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the Federal Ministry of Education disclosed to Theweek that but for the last minute effort of Iyabo Anisulowo, minister of state in the ministry, the government by last Thursday would have announce the sack. She was said to have prevailed on Aso Rock to consider the initiative of a group of professors acting under the aegis of the All Professor Conference of Nigeria, APCON, who have promised to thaw the ice of confrontation between ASUU and the government. By the end of the week, however, it was obvious that the initiative had collapsed. The all-professor conference could not hold.  Some of the professors not only disassociate themselves from the conference, they joined ranks with ASUU in condemning what they described as the strike- breaking antics of APCON.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the collapse of the apparently last initiative, the government seems set to wield the stick. Sources at the federal ministry say the government will soon brief the committee of vice-chancellors on the draconinan measures it intends to take so that they could make security arrangements on the campuses when the sack hammer descends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As if to stoke the already volatile situations, angry students are warming up to join the fray. Fear that the nation might witness another students' unrest similar to the 'Ali must go' demonstrations of the 1970s rose sharply last week following a seven-day ultimatum which the National Association of Nigerian students, gave to the federal government to restore normalcy to the nation's univerisity system. The ultimatum came through a statement issued by Sylvester Onoja, national mobilisation officer of NANS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Investigations revealed that before the student's ultimatium, issued in Jos, NANS had discussed extensively the ongoing strike by ASUU, and the subsequent banning of the union by the federal government. Until now, NANS had maintained a studied silence which it says was borne out of a &quot;matured and disciplined students unionism,&quot; and the resolve by the students' leaders to &quot;allow an employer-employee dispute to be resolved without interference.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, after watching the gladiators for the fourth month running and seeing no solution to the dispute, the students have become militant. As Onoja puts it, &quot;we have been watching with melancholy, the criminal scuttling and frustration of the aspiration of Nigeria Students occasioned by the failure of government and ASUU to reach a compromise in the face-off&quot; and warned that: &quot;The high degree of patience being exercised by students union leaders in universities across the country should not be mistaken for lack of courage to act.&quot; NANS, through the statement, directed students union leaders in universities across the country to report on campus if they have not already done so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the University of Lagos, Theweek found that a number of students had arrived the campus apparently in keeping with the NANS directive. The students, however, maintained that their presence on campus had nothing to do with the impending showdown with the authorities. They said that students were on campus to pursue their private studies in the hope that the lecturers would decide to go back to the classrooms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Bayero University, Kano, which officially re-opened July 16, normal academic activities are yet to resume. By last week, the few lecturers who have agreed to return to classes were engaged in a game of wits with those who have vowed to continue with the strike. Theweek found that even though the school has re-opened, academic activities were episodic, a situation that has prompted some of the final year students to express their doubts to Heads of Department. Theweek learnt that the students were assured that in the event of the lingering strike being called off soon, a crash programme will be organised to graduate them on schedule. But if the strike continued, all courses that could not be offered as a result would be regarded as carry-over courses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To worsen the problem of the Bayero University, those lecturers who volunteered to return to the classroom have been less than enthusiastic. Some of them merely wrote their names down as willing to teach in order to collect their pay after which they absconded. To confounded the situation, the population of the returning students is minimal. The bulk of the university students, as indeed, their colleague elsewhere have decided to watch the face- off from the safety of their homes. In desperation, the authorities of Bayero University have resorted to threats to rusticate students who fail to show up.  In the meantime, the local ASUU at BUK is unimpressed by any form of threat.  In one of its numerous meetings last week, the union strenghtened its resolve to continue with the strike even though salaries had been stopped. Ibrahim Lawal, chairman of the local chapters says that as long as the national ASUU is on strike, BUK lecturers will continue to stay out of the classroom. &quot;No retreat, no surrender until our demands are met,&quot; he affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lecturers elsewhere equally seem uncompromising. Rather, they are surprised about reports that the government has called for a list of vocal and militant lecturers for punishment, and the purported dismissal of some 100 lecturers at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. Similar reports have also been received from the University of Ilorin and the Federal University of Technology, Owerri.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such arm-twisting appears to have been in vain. From Edo State University, Ekpoma, for example, the ASUU branch under the chairmanship of Clement Edokpayi has stated that only peace brokered through discussions with ASUU as a national body can get them back to the classroom. The local ASUU there has described as a false claim, the information published by the university authority in its bulletin of July 4, to the effect that 12 per cent of the lecturers have agreed to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the University of Ilorin, reports have it that the ASUU branch there has washed its hands off the school authority's on-going search for a successor for the out-going vice-chancellor. According to a statement signed by B.  Lawal and Kola Joseph, chairman and secretary respectively, lecturers are on strike and cannot take part in the search for a new vice-chancellor. This action casts doubts on the claim by the university authority that over 60 per cent of the lecturers in the institution have signified their readiness to resume work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Perhaps it was an indication of the way matters might turn in the days ahead that at the Univeristy of Lagos, mobile policemen in armoured personnel carrier have been stationed at the gate, a situation which the students on campus say they do not find funny. Of course, nobody does.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Politicians remain restless even as NECON commences verification of claims by the 18 associations seeking registration as political parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As part of the preparation for a press briefing on the readiness of his association for the National Electoral Commission of Nigeria's verification exercise, Chris Okolie, spokesman of the Committee for National Consensus, decided to arm himself with first hand information from the party's secretariats in all the states. He physically visited some state capitals while in other cases he collected information through the telephone and correspondence with state chairmen and secretaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;From what I gathered, our people are ready for NECON officials and the national secretariat has sent instructions to the state secretariats for the necessary officials to remain at their duty posts during the period of the verification exercise,&quot; Okolie later told reporters.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Okolie's anxiety to ensure that nothing goes wrong in the CNC gives a fair idea of the frantic efforts being made by politicians to ensure that their associations survive the current exercise to register parties for the new political dispensation. Two weeks after the submission of registration materials, top officers of the 18 associations are still busy putting finishing touches to their plans to meet the NECON verification team. Most of the associations are hiring offices to serve as secretariats while those who already have offices are seeking to make them functional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 3, members of the national executive committee of the Nation Builders Congress were in Ilorin to launch the Kwara State chapter on Abdul Aziz Atta Road. The launch came a few days after a similar ceremoney was performed to commence the use of the Abuja secretariat in Asokoro district.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some other groups, the major assignment is to provide directions that would make the secretariats easily indentifiable to NECON officials. The People's Consensus Party recently installed a signboard in front of its office in Ogba, Lagos. Another imposing signboard, glowing with its multi- color paints, has sprouted up on Adeniyi Jones Street indicating that the United Nigeria Congress, the All Nigeria Congress, the Nigeria Center Party and the United Nigerian Party have acquired offices in very strategic locations for their state and local government chapters. The four parties have also not rested their mobilisation campaigns for new members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rush to establish offices and make them conspicuous for NECON verifiers is predicted on the directive given to NECON officials by the headquarters of the commission on August 1. In a 27-page checklist handed over to the zonal coordinators of the exercise, NECON insisted that its officers would not waste time on associations whose claims could not be easily ascertained and authenticated. As part of the verification, NECON officers were instructed not to condone any execuse for the absence of persons charged with the responsibility of furnishing them with membership cards. The verifiers are also to check members' faces against the photographs in their party forms submitted to NECON.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NECON officials are also to take special notice of a situation where a party member could not be located at the given address. Where a member is properly located, he will be expected to answer questions on how he was recruited, what dues he paid to join and names of his ward leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sumner Dagogo-Jack, NECON chairman, who briefed the six zonal co-ordinators, warned that &quot;the claims to be verified are clearly defined&quot; and that they (the officials) &quot;should not be influenced by any other factors or consideration.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Theweek, however, learnt that NECON's verification team is not the only cause of anxiety among the political groups. The involvement of personnel of the State Security Services and the National Orientation Agency in the verification exercise is getting the politicians more worried. The security agents are said to be working independently to interrogate members of the national and state executives of the associations on their source of funds, sponsors, political antecedents and assets. As at last week, state officers of the PCP in Abia and Kebbi states had been visited by security agents. In some instances, the security agents were said to have made repeated calls to demand more facts from the affected politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As soon as information reached the national headquarters of the PCP on the exercise by the SSS, it called a meeting of the national executive committee of the association. Olorunfunmi Bashorun, the publicity secretary, said the meeting held in Abuja last Thursday amd attended by state chairmen and secretaries of the association, was convened to take progress report on the verification exercise and to give appropriate instructions to the state party leaders. &quot;We realised that NECON concentrated on state and local government secretariats of the associations. We had to meet and discuss the developments with respect to the registration exercise,&quot; said Bashorun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reports, however, indicate that the information sought by the SSS officials are not entirely different from the ones sought by NECON officials. At the Lagos State office of PCP, the chairman, Rahman Owokoniran played host to NECON officials last Tuesday. He said he was asked questions bordering on how the group acquired its office, the identity of the sponsors, the source of the funds, qualifications of its staff and the membership spread of the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from making efforts to meet the immediate requirements of NECON, the People's Progressive Party has sent word to its state and local government officials to continue the weekly meetings at the state and ward levels. The idea, according to Chukwuemeka Ezeife, PPP secretary and former governor of Anambara State, is to attract more members. &quot;We have not closed registration as we expect new members to join us,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the PPP, the CNC, Okolie disclosed last week, is using the period of the verification exercise to further spread its tentacles to the grassroots and popularise its &quot;centrist, consensus oriented ideology.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - As expected, the government of Kenya has reacted sharply to calls by churches in the country for wide ranging review of the Constitution ahead of General Elections due before December 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Office of the President Minister Kipkalya Kones charged that the Catholic church and the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK), an umbrella body comprising 35 protestant churches, eight associate members and seven fraternal members, were working in league with the Opposition and foreigners to agitate for a boycott of the forthcoming election and &quot;create mayhem through civil disobedience.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His strongly worded statement came 48 hours after the country's 22 Catholic bishops and the NCCK separately issued calls for urgent political reforms in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the Secretary General of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party Mr. Joseph Kamotho, who is also the Minister for Education, described the churches' call &quot;as another revolutionary idea of overthrowing the Constitution which has served us well since independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the new pro-Nuncio in Nairobi, barely two months old in office, urged Kenya's politicians critical of the churches' stand to stop being emotional &quot; and take time to read and analyze carefully the contents of the bishops' Pastoral Letter before criticising it.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Pope John Paul II fully backed the call by the Catholic bishops for a review of the Constitution and an all-party dialogue on the composition of a new Electoral Commission. Archbishop Tonucci reiterated: &quot;I say the recent Pastoral Letter issued by the Kenyan bishops has the backing of the Holy Father.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their hard hitting statements, the Kenyan churches cautioned the government that unless it was willing to initiate wide-ranging political reforms as well as an all-party dialogue on the composition of a new Electoral Commission, they would have no alternative but to call on their followers to boycott the General Election due next year. The term of validity of the current Electoral Commission, headed by Justice (Rtd.) Zacchaeus Chesoni expires this November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Pastoral Letter of the Catholic bishops was entitled, Our Social Responsibility while the NCCK presented the council's concerns in a statement sub-titled, Our Common Future, drawn from the outcome of the 53rd General Assembly held in the coastal town of Mombasa late July.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Catholics and Protestants particularly want the Constitution amended so that the successful presidential candidate is one who wins more than 50 per cent of the popular vote, rather than the stipulated 25 per cent in five provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCCK pointed out that on New Year's Eve (January 1, 1995) President Moi promised to initiate a review process but this has never happened. And the Chairman of the Kenya Episcopal Conference Archbishop Zacheus Okoth, told a news conference soon after the release of the Pastoral Letter on August 6, that &quot;the homework has been done. Kenyans are ready and in some areas only two days are required for the review process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the NCCK and Catholics are unhappy that under the current provisions, the Electoral Commission &quot;is appointed solely by the Head of State and lacks true independence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They proposed that in order to achieve a balance, the opposition and other civic bodies like the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) be involved. Individual nominees would then elect the head of the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their letter, the Catholic bishops lamented the breakdown in the provision of health, education and transport services. They also questioned the motive behind the establishment of a bullet factory at Eldoret, in Kenya's Rift Valley Province which the government says is for the country's military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The on-going construction of an airport in Eldoret, some 270 kilometres north-west of Nairobi, the third major airport in Kenya after Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Mombasa's Moi International Airport, was another issue that raised nationwide controversy particularly in 1994. A cross section of Kenyans, notably the opposition, outspoken individuals and civic groups, generally expressed concern that a third airport was not a priority development project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They were of the opinion that Kenyan roads, which among other transport needs serve as the only means of transporting farm produce for the ordinary person, were in poor shape and needed more urgent attention than the airport project in the Rift Valley Province town. But the government has gone ahead with the project whose approval earlier on, passed through the normal parliamentary procedures. President Moi comes from the Rift Valley region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lately this year, news about the construction of the bullet factory in the same town became a subject of much speculation and debate, particularly among opposition legislators who questioned the motive behind such a factory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another issue that worries many Kenyans is the land grabbing mania, wherein the politically correct are rewarded with parcels of public land (&quot;plots&quot;), sometimes without regard to the future. Graveyards, public toilets, and children's playgrounds have become easy prey for the plot grabbers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although President Daniel arap Moi recently intervened to stop land related malpractices, the move was generally viewed as coming too late.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic bishops in their latest appeal said the Small Christian Communities (SCCs), which are dynamic neighbourhood social action and prayer groups would be used to raise public awareness of the evils of vote buying and election rigging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic clergy were at pains to stress non-violent agitation for change &quot;even when provoked.&quot; The head of the Catholic Church in Kenya Maurice Cardinal Otunga noted that the churches &quot;had played their role by pointing out injustices. God will take up whips and punish those who failed to heed this message.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In their press conference the same day, Protestant churches, through the Chairman of the NCCK Bishop Joseph Wesonga and General Secretary Pastor Mutava Musyimi called for &quot;basic reforms&quot; to be implemented before Kenyans should accept to participate in the next general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCCK letter to Christians also lamented that more than 30 years after independence, Kenyans were still subject to repressive colonial laws introduced by the British in the 40s and 50s as a measure to curtail the activities of the pre-independence Mau Mau freedom fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They also cited among what they called &quot;anti-people laws&quot; the Chief's Authority Act and various sedition and treason provisions of the Penal Code of Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They called for a new system of grassroots administration, preferably based on the concept of electing leaders. A similar process is in operation in Uganda and Tanzania through Resistance Committees (RCs) and Local Committees (LCs) respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCCK also called for full freedom for the public media in Kenya, and the freeing of airwaves by the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other issues covered by the churches include the provision of national identity cards to all eligible persons over 18 years of age and the financing of the forthcoming general election. In the last General Election, KANU, then being the only ruling party, had access to state funds. In a multi-party state, all political parties should have access to government funds, in preparation for general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Mr. Njenga Mungai, outspoken Member of Parliament for Molo constituency in Nakuru District, and a strong critic of the government's inability to effectively end the 1991 to 1994 ethnic land clashes which seriously affected his area, says he fears the rush to review the Constitution could throw the country into turmoil. He instead calls for a gradual process of change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a press conference in the Rift Valley Province town of Nakuru, some 160 kilometres north-west of Nairobi on August 13, the Opposition Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD-Asili) legislator asked the opposition not to put pressure on President Daniel arap Moi with their quest for constitutional reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warned that if reforms were implemented in a random manner, Kenya faced the risk of being plunged into chaos as has happened in Zaire and Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - For the second time in as many years, the annual Zimbabwe International Book Fair (ZIBF) was eclipsed by the row over the presence of the Gays and Lesbians Association of Zimbabwe (GALZ), a group whose activities would not be discussed in public according to indigenous tradition of the majority Zimbabweans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the official close of business, initially set for 6 pm on August 3, exhibitors whose turnout was 25 per cent higher than previous years, had packed away their wares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the significant growth in the number of exhibitors, the fair appeared to have been losing its glory in the eyes of the public over the last two years, if attendance figures are anything to go by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most stands resembled the empty symbolic GALZ stand, whose members were missing for the third day since winning their July 31 court battle to be allowed to man a stand. Although GALZ had the right to exhibit pamphlets and the like for the two days of the fair, the group not only failed to exhibit but had no one manning their stand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year, 31,000 people visited the book fair, about 2,000 less than the record 33,000 figure in 1994. It was during the 1995 event that GALZ was granted permission to exhibit at the fair, although the decision was reversed at the request of the Zimbabwean government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisers were silent on the GALZ issue and attributed the decline to the absence of school children. &quot;The event did not fall on any of the school holidays, hence the decline in attendance,&quot; said the spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the 1995 ZIBF, the banning of GALZ from exhibiting was accentuated by Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe's strong stance thus; &quot;If we accept homosexuality as a right, as is being argued by the association of sodomites and sexual perverts, what moral fibre shall our society ever have to deny organized drug addicts or even those given to bestiality, the rights they might claim and allege they possess under the rubrics of 'individual freedom' and 'human rights', including the freedom of the press to write ...on them?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But for GALZ Administrator, Keith Groddard, the association's participation at the &quot;1996 ZIBF represents strong advances in the battle for freedom of expression and cultural diversity in Zimbabwe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement, Groddard noted that culture belonged to all in Zimbabwe and dictations from politicians that all persons within a nation shall conform to a single set of cultural norms is loathsome in the extreme and to be challenged forcefully at every time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's censorship board had banned GALZ organisation from participating at this and any other fair in the country, a decision which was later nullified by the High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One exhibitor who sought anonymity expressed concern about security at the event saying; &quot;There have been a lot of threats against some aspects of this event. Nothing has taken place so far and we cannot take chances,&quot; he added, as he stored away books long before closing time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most parents and schools would not allow their children to visit the fair, for fear that their young ones would get the wrong message from the exhibitors, it was established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1995, some 50,000 visitors were expected at the annual exhibition.  Entrance fees were introduced in 1994 and these have been in place since, despite calls to accord visitors free entry to the exhibition, whose theme this year was Books for Business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About $100,000 worth of books were sold at the fair's bookshop, a figure which fell short of last year's figure. The shortfall was attributed to a 10 to 15 per cent increase on sales tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A fruitful writer's workshop ran as a parallel event to the book fair. This forum attempted to address problems facing today's authors, publishers, and more so the readership on the African continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also at the book fair was a large selection of cultural displays, art, dance, and drama which helped keep visitors entertained. These were sub- contracted to the Harare Polytechnic Fine Arts Department who ran the programme as part of their marketing strategy for the Harare International Fine Arts festival scheduled for 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the Frankfurt Book Fair - the world's largest - is reviewing its relationship with the Zimbabwe International Book Fair after the government's repeated interference with the right of participants to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This action was prompted by the controversy surrounding the GALZ group and their right to exhibit at the ZIBF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a protest handed to the Zimbabwe embassy in Bonn, Frankfurt Book Fair Director Peter Weidhaas said, he was afraid the exclusion of GALZ on direct orders from the government could mark the end of the Zimbabwe International Book Fair as the main commercial and cultural publishing event of sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Weidhaas' remarks were echoed by the representative of the Frankfurt Book Fair at the Zimbabwe fair, Peter Ripken, who said his organization would have to reconsider its future attendance given what he called &quot;the climate of intimidation and censorship.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government was damaging the reputation of the fair, he said, and &quot; Zimbabwe would soon become a pariah state like Nigeria if they go on like this. &quot;Why come when our books may be banned, when our stalls will not be protected from government-instigated mobs?&quot; he asked. Ripken said as a German, he fully understood the dangers of persecuting a minority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African publishers were equally forthright. The controversy surrounding the right of GALZ to exhibit would have a negative effect on future participation by South African publishers, said representative Gavin Cutler.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It (the attempt to bar GALZ) represented &quot;an abnormal abuse of Zimbabwe's host status,&quot; said Cutler, pointing out that freedom of expression was essential to the success of the fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Francois McHardy of the Witwatersrand University Press said it was &quot;absurd and short-sighted of the government not to allow a group to participate because of their sexual orientation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He pointed out that the fair was a big boost for Harare's economy with all the main hotels full. &quot;How would the curio craftsmen and traders feel if the book fair were to fail?&quot; posed McHardy. &quot;People have to realise that intolerance is going to affect them economically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the government's stance came under fire from human rights group Amnesty International. &quot;Although police protection was formally requested for GALZ, there was no official response, while law endorsement officials have said gays and lesbians have no right to help from police if they are attacked, &quot; an Amnesty statement pointed out. &quot;Government inaction to protect GALZ members would amount to condoning such abuse,&quot; the AI statement added, referring to threats from Sangano Munhumutapa, a tribalist grouping and some legislators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Freedom of expression and freedom of association are the rights that make it possible to discuss, meet and organise around the defence of human rights, including rights related to a person's sexual orientation,&quot; Amnesty said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, publishers of educational materials have been urged to &quot; price for the market&quot; when selling textbooks in developing countries so as to make books easily available and help promote a reading culture. &quot;Textbooks must be easily available to students. It is important to look at your market and make the books affordable. This will help empower students and create a greater readership base,&quot; said Ms May Bowden, a sales executive with Britain's John Wiley publishers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A participant at the ZIBF, Bowden noted that most publishers were simply converting prices set for developed countries when selling the same texts to developing country students.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One should take into consideration the buying power of people you are dealing with. It is also important to compare the two currencies involved before arriving at a price,&quot; Bowden stressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judged as the best publisher in the United Kingdom in 1996, John Wiley specializes in scientific and technical textbooks, especially for tertiary institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bowden said her company was committed to the education system in Southern Africa and worked in close co-operation with local institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We also publish general interest books and scientific journals. We are committed to supporting a book culture within the region,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most publishers are from the developed world. A uniform pricing system would disadvantage students from developing countries and it is for this reason that we employ a policy of market pricing,&quot; Bowden added.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A truce declared by Somali factional leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed following the death of rival strongman Mohamed Farah Aideed on August 1 collapsed on August 10 as the two sides' militias fought for a strategic air base west of the capital, Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fighting was also reported in villages between the Ballidogle base and the town of Afgoye, 30 kilometres south of the capital, according to militia field radios monitored in the Somali capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They said the battle for the Ballidogle base, built by the Soviet Union for Somalia's air force in the 1970s, began at noon (0900 GMT) on August 10 and by mid-afternoon, the casualty toll on both sides had reached 11 dead and 19 wounded, with the fighting continuing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali Mahdi told journalists at his stronghold in north Mogadishu that his militiamen had captured the base, which is 90 kilometres west of Mogadishu, but that claim could not be independently confirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The base is difficult to hold, as it is surrounded by dense bush in which militiamen armed with anti-aircraft rockets can take cover and attack aircraft as they land or take off. Ali Mahdi told reporters late the previous week that his militiamen in the bush would shoot down any aircraft attempting to land there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two sides were using 106mm recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft rockets, 75mm anti-tank ordinance, and heavy and light machine-guns, according to the reports reaching Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 11, fighting was also reported to have flared between the two rival Somali factions on the strategic road leading to Ballidogle airport, which had been cut off the previous day. At least 12 people were reported killed and a dozen others injured in the clashes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sporadic fighting also flickekered in the Medina neighbourhood of south Mogadishu on the morning of August 11, while other reports reaching Mogadishu detailed heavy fighting between the rival militia in Balad district, north of Mogadishu. The number of casualties from the fighting was not yet available, but eyewitnesses said that a number of people had either been killed or wounded and hundreds of families displaced by the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalis were also bracing since August 7 for a battle for Baidoa, the main centre of the fertile Juba River valley. The Raharwein clan announced on August 4 that they had recaptured the town of Hoddur, 350 kilometres north- west of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mogadishu and close to Baidoa, at the cost of 66 deaths and 91 wounded among their own militiamen</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and those of the Aideed faction, who had taken the town last February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hussein Aideed categorically denied on August 6, without giving details, that the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) had recaptured Hoddur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its fall was confirmed by travellers from the area, but they were unable to confirm the casualty toll. Hoddur lies in an open plain which provides no cover for attackers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Militia sources said militiamen from the two factions were converging on Baidoa, which General Aideed captured from the RRA last September at the head of a column of 600 men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The battle will start within 24 hours,&quot; one Somali analyst predicted on the morning of August 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The capital, where about 150 people were killed in battles last month, remained tense following a declaration by Hussein Aideed that he would &quot; eliminate all internal and external enemies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two rivals to Aideed -- the self-styled Somali interim president Ali Mahdi Mohammed, who controls north Mogadishu, and Osman Hassan Ali &quot;Atto,&quot; one-time Aideed financier-turned bitter political foe, whose United Somali Congress (USC)/ Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction controls part of the south of the capital, have both put their militiamen on high alert and threatened to cancel ceasefires they declared after General Aideed's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was the first reported factional fighting in Somalia since Aideed died here on August 1 from gunshot wounds he received a week earlier in fighting in Medina, and the replacement of the general at the head of the USC/SNA faction by his 34-year-old son, Hussein Mohamed, a former United States marine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political observers in the Somali capital believe that the resumption of fighting now threatened to plunge Somalia, which has been ruled by feuding groups since the overthrow of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991 after a bloody civil war, further into a political abyss that could drag on much longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to analysts, the faction headed by former US marine Hussein Aideed after his father, who died after being shot in the chest, stomach and leg while leading an attack on a south Mogadishu enclave, was already showing signs that it may disintegrate soon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The election on August 4 of the inexperienced 34-year-old to replace his slain father was seen here as an attempt to keep the south Mogadishu-based faction together. Hussein Aideed has spent virtually all his adult life in the United States, where he went as a teenager, returning briefly in 1993 as a marine with a US intervention force battling his father's militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A reservist, he was sent back to America as his father's militias dragged the bodies of slain US troops through the streets of Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He came back again last year, married, and became head of the faction's security committee, helping his father to secure the strategic town of Baidoa, 240 kilometres north-west of Mogadishu and the main centre of the fertile Juba River Valley.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With his muscular build -- unusual among Somalis, who are generally slim -- and his marine swagger, he became popular with the faction's unpaid and unkempt militiamen. But the ability to keep a faction together in this Horn of Africa nation where clan politics make those of Byzantium appear simple, depends on years of experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The powerful figures in each clan, sub-clan and additional sub- clans, are frequently not those put forward as leaders, and the alliances shift almost daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aideed, who tried to appear &quot;presidential&quot; during an interview on August 6, wearing slacks, jacket and tie, and speaking so quietly as to be almost inaudible, was flanked then by General Jama Mohamed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghalib, the hard-line &quot;Foreign Minister&quot; in the unrecognised &quot;government of Somalia&quot; his father set up last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghalib, a northern Issak, was close to General Aideed, a member of the Saad sub-clan of the Habr Gedir sub-clan of central Somalia's Hawiye, because the two men thought the same way, according to Somalis who knew them both.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was clear during the interview that Ghalib was in charge, since he fielded the tricky questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somali analysts also say that Aideed was given the top job because the alternatives, such as Abdul Rahman Ali &quot;Tuur,&quot; another Issak, and the first president of breakaway Somaliland in the north-west, would have divided the alliance immediately.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the general gone, the power of the Issaks in the alliance is seen as residual, as they do not have militias of their own, and the power behind the throne is up for grabs, the analysts say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Feelers from various clan groupings within the faction began to go out as soon as Hussein Aideed was nominated and accepted without dissent by the faction's leadership on August 4, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those soundings are being made through third parties, and are thus deniable.  Aideed's &quot;Interior Minister,&quot; Mohamed Qanyare Afrah was reported to have told diplomats the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, that Aideed's accession was a &quot; coup.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qanyare Afrah, a member of the southern Murusade clan, was formerly allied with the Abgal clan of north Mogadishu strongman Ali Mahdi Mohamed, but defected to General Aideed in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His hard line as an Aideed minister means that he has burnt his bridges with Ali Mahdi, whom he accused of lusting for power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other leaders within the faction are putting out feelers to see if they can rejoin factions they abandoned to ride on General Aideed's coat-tails when he was humiliating US and United Nations forces and capturing territory from other factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That peak has gone, with the faction's militiamen spread thin, defending those parts of south Mogadishu that they hold, Baidoa, and positions in the lower Shabelle River valley, south of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ali Mahdi has, meanwhile, told Aideed to remove his militiamen from the south Mogadishu enclave of Medina, where General Aideed was shot on July 25, warning that he was likely to revoke the ceasefire he declared then if Hussein Aideed did not pull his men out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts say that Osman Hassan Ali &quot;Atto,&quot; former financier to General Aideed but now an Ali Mahdi ally, could well do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Medina is held primarily by members of Ali Mahdi's Abgal clan under the command of a former businessman, Musa Sude Yalahow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Somalia is in the throw of another bloody clan struggle for control of the country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nakuru, Kenya - An outspoken Kenyan Catholic bishop says the resettling of victims of politically motivated land clashes that affected parts of the country between 1991 and 1994, is a prerequisite for genuine peace and development in those areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking here some 160 kilometres north-west of the capital Nairobi, outgoing diocesan bishop Ndingi Mwana a' Nzeki said, the prevailing state of fear and apprehension among the residents of Molo and Olenguruone in Nakuru district has rendered impractical efforts by the Catholic church to implement medical and education services in the interior for the benefit of the locals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Ndingi, whom Pope John Paul II appointed coadjutor Archbishop of the Nairobi Archdiocese on June 27, said it was the responsibility of the government to resettle the displaced people and to initiate moves towards reconciling them as soon as possible, instead of &quot;trying to create a false impression that peace has returned to the area.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The prevailing tension, he explained, has made local residents become suspicious of any visitor who tours the area, as &quot;witnessed in the threats that meet the church staff sent to assess development initiatives.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But reacting to Bishop Ndingi's statement, local District Commissioner John Abduba said the government had already re-settled the victims of the land clashes, contrary to the bishop's claims.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not true that the Government has not yet resettled the victims of the land clashes and that an atmosphere of apprehension and fear prevailed in the area as claimed by Bishop Ndingi,&quot; the government administrator was quoted in a report, carried by the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party daily, Kenya Times.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The DC observed that Bishop Ndingi's remarks could stir fear and tension by reminding the people of the unfortunate past, and urged the bishop and other clergy to assist the government in advocating reconciliation and good neighbourliness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The district administrator said some of those displaced during the clashes in 1992 failed to return to their farms, not because of insecurity but as a result of incitement and misleading stories by some individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Mr. Ernest Murimi, the Nakuru Catholic Diocese Executive Secretary for Justice and Peace Commission, &quot;most of the victims of the land clashes are still under the care of the church, among other non-governmental organizations, because the government is yet to come out with a workable system of resettling them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Murimi said it is important that the government provides facts and figures to suppoort what the DC said. He told APS; ...&quot;It would have been fair for Mr. Abduba to tell us where victims have been resettled, their numbers and when they were resettled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A report sent to APS by the Nakuru Diocese Justice and Peace Commission says the displacement of 30,000 people from Enosupukia in Narok District in mid-October, 1993 and camps at Maela trading centre in the Nakuru Diocese, almost doubled the workload of the office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And while many of the victims slowly drifted to other areas in Kenya, seeking housing and support from family members and relatives located elsewhere, over 10,000 displaced persons remained at Maela and the surroundings, 450 at Elburgon town, two at Molo town, 250 at Kamwaura Catholic Mission, 3,000 at Nakuru town, 200 at Thessalia and 50 at Kerisoi centre, says the report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, a proposed resettlement programme, which was to be undertaken jointly by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Kenya government did not take off, &quot;despite the fact that UNDP spent Kshs.40 million (about US$714,000) in preparation for rehabilitation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It further says the Catholic diocese of Nakuru spent Kshs 36 million (US$642,000) to provide food, clothing and health care among other services for the displaced people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only 200 families (1,250 out of 30,000 people) were resettled at Moi Ndabi on government-owned land, says the Nakuru Diocese report, adding...&quot;the rest were left hanging at Maela Trading Centre.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked what steps the Catholic diocese was taking towards resettling the victims, who were still under their care, Murimi told APS; &quot;We intend to resettle the land clashes' victims, who are still living in the centres of Maela, Elburgon and Kamwaura. These people, are apparently not able to find any other alternative. Their living conditions have deteriorated as they have been abandoned by both the Government and UNDP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the NGOs and churches, according to Murimi, seem to have given up on the issue of resettlement. &quot;However, with the past experience on the resettlement programme for needy families, we are confident that resettlement even on a small scale can be carried out successfully,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Justice and Peace Commission office expressed concern about reports pointing to the resurgence of similar skirmishes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to claims made by Bishop Ndingi last April that residents living around forest areas in Molo within the Nakuru Diocese, were apprehensive about an outbreak of fresh &quot;ethnic clashes,&quot; following the entry of three lorries full of unknown people into the forests of Molo and Njoro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Catholic prelate had also claimed that locals had begun to flee in fear of attacks on peasant farmers and incidences of cattle rustling had increased.  But these claims were denied by the local authorities, with one of them referring to Bishop Ndingi as a &quot;liar&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a comprehensive report that was compiled by a parliamentary commission headed by MP Kennedy Kiliku at the height of the 1991/1992 land clashes, more than 500 people were reported to have lost their lives while 1, 000 were said to have been displaced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Burundi's new junta ruler Major Pierre Buyoya has offered to talk to Hutu extremists fighting the Tutsi-led military government in a last- ditch effort to find a way out of the political imbroglio in his country, completely cut off from the outside world on August 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a national broadcast setting out a three-year transitional programme, Buyoya, who ousted President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya in a bloodless coup on July 25, also went on to warn that &quot;dialogue with armed factions&quot; would only be possible if they first laid down their arms and rejected &quot;destructive ideologies of extermination and genocide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya last month justified his July 25 coup saying he had stepped in to haul the country back from the abyss after three years of civil strife, during which tens of thousands of rival Tutsis and Hutus massacred each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week's broadcast text set out a four-point plan for the war- torn tiny Central African state, which included talks with armed factions, national debate, political and social reconstruction, and rebuilding state structures.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The process of national reconciliation &quot;should start in October 1996, if the conditions are right,&quot; Buyoya said, holding out the prospect of approving the resumption of party political activity, suspended since the current change in leadership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We confirm the transitional nature of the regime in place since July 25 and set a three-year transition period,&quot; Buyoya said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the transitional period, the country would be governed by a &quot; transitional national assembly&quot; which is to be created shortly from the national assembly disbanded following the coup, and leading members of the civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Buyoya will also be advised by a &quot;council of wise men,&quot; according to his speech, which also appealed to the international community to lift economic sanctions imposed by regional African states to punish his seizure of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The broadcast came only hours after the departure of the last two international commercial flights from landlocked Burundi, whose borders were sealed last week under an embargo prompted by a military coup last month, signalling its complete isolation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two jets of the Belgian airline Sabena, left on August 13 night carrying some 400 people. The company said the flights would be the last &quot;for several weeks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The flights were the last two commercial departures to be authorized by Burundi's African neighbours who imposed the embargo to back their demand that major Pierre Buyoya, who seized power in a bloodless coup on July 25, return the country to &quot;constitutional order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the passengers was Pascasie Minani, wife of president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya who fled to the US embassy two days before the takeover by the army which is dominated by the Tutsi ethnic minority, and still remains there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was preceded by the wife of Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first elected Hutu president who was assassinated in October 1993 in an abortive army coup, only a few months after taking office. Ndadaye's widow had been staying at the Belgian embassy since July 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Burundian authorities also sanctioned the departure of former Finance Minister Salvator Toyi, a member of Ntibantunganya's Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU), who had taken refuge at the European Union mission in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, reliable sources said several other senior officials of the former regime, believed to include Ntibantunganya himself, had been denied permission to leave.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All embassies in Bujumbura urged their nationals to leave Burundi if they had no essential reason for staying, but no evacuation was planned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Washington said 23 United States officials would remain in Bujumbura. Burundi's neighbours, including Rwanda which has the same volatile ethnic mix of 85 per cent Hutus and 14 per cent Tutsis, decreed an embargo against Burundi on July 31 following the military takeover by Buyoya, who ruled Burundi from 1987 to 1993 when he was defeated in elections by Ndadaye.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo has been implemented by Tanzania, which handles most of Burundi's imports and exports, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Zaire and Cameroon and has already created a shortage of petrol which is now rationed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Tanzania and Kenya have since agreed to be more flexible and a convoy of 210 tonnes of food from the World Food Programme (WFP) was expected to cross the border from Tanzania, after aid organizations said the embargo would deprive refugees and vulnerable people of vital food stuffs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape Town - South African police said on August 13 that they had arrested a prominent Islamic militant in connection with the mob lynching on August 4 of gang leader, Rashaad Staggie on the troubled Cape Flats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A police spokesman said a 37-year-old alleged leader of the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD) was arrested on charges of sedition and murder and more arrests could follow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they had also searched a number of houses in the Cape Flats, a vast network of mixed-race townships that are home to many of the city's gangsters and their opponents in the Muslim-based anti-gang movement.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The area has been tense since Staggie, the leader of the &quot;Hard Livings&quot; gang, was shot several times and then burnt alive after a pitched gun battle between 2,000 PAGAD supporters and gangsters outside Staggie's home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrest comes after PAGAD early last week extended their earlier threats of armed action against gangsters, to the government, for failing to prevent crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGAD spokesman Farook Jaffer threatened a &quot;Jihad (holy war)&quot; if the government did not eliminate drug dealing within 14 days, or if gangsters do not consent to end their illegal business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 11, nine people were injured -- including three by police birdshots when about 1,000 PAGAD members and police clashed after a PAGAD rally, prompting the Western Cape provincial government to call on President Nelson Mandela to impose a state of emergency in the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said they had used teargas, rubber bullets and birdshots on the PAGAD demonstrators after they rampaged through the streets brandishing weapons in contravention of an earlier undertaking they had given national police commissioner George Fivaz, that they would not carry weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After the incident, police said they seized 12 handguns and 221 rounds of ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the rally, before the clash with police, an unnamed PAGAD leader had told supporters not to be afraid of dying for their cause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;True followers of Allah (God) can't wait to die as then they will meet Allah himself,&quot; said the leader, hiding his identity behind a Palestinian- style scarf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Accusing police and the government of siding with known criminals, Jaffer told the South African Press Agency (SAPA) that PAGAD might turn to radical armed Islamic groups in the Middle East, including Lebanon's Hezbollah, for aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If this (war against drugs) is going to carry on and police continue to entertain the criminals, then we will have to call them (Hezbollah and other groups) in, &quot;Jaffer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGAD's campaign has generated interest in the alleged activities of Islamic militants in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police have been under pressure to prevent mob rule following the August 4 lynching of Staggie, in which he was shot and then set alight outside his home after a pitched gun battle between gangsters and about 2,000 masked PAGAD members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGAD's campaign, amid claims by one of its leaders that he received military training in Libya, has generated interest in the alleged activities of Islamic militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a secret police report that was leaked to the press last week, members of 11 South African &quot;Muslim extremist fundamentalist&quot; groups have received military training in Libya, Afghanistan and Iran.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niamey - Niger's Health Ministry has admitted that some of the more than five million anti-meningitis vaccines distributed in the country against an epidemic last year did not work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to reports in France that thousands of phoney vaccines were handed out to fight an outbreak of meningitis that claimed more than 3,000 lives in the impoverished West African nation last year, the ministry said there were several possible reasons why some were ineffective.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a radio statement on August 10, the Health Ministry said vaccines were issued throughout the country without undergoing any prior quality control, but that in two regions they appeared to have no effect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our concern was the urgent protection of the population given the severity of the epidemic,&quot; it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, it was noted in two regions of the country that the epidemic was persisting despite all the vaccination efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Niger's Health Ministry however said there were several possible reasons why the vaccines did not work, including their quality and storage or handling mistakes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two affected areas were given new vaccines and those which were doubtful were destroyed, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry made no mention of ongoing fraud inquiries into the phoney vaccines which were ordered last year but have so far produced no result.  Neither has anyone been charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Paris business newspaper Le Echos said in a report published from the French city of Lyons on August 9 that the thousands of phoney vaccines were among a consignment of 60,000 vaccines doses, officially provided by Nigeria at the height of the Niger epidemic in the spring of 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a spokesman of the pharmaceuticals company, Pasteur Merieux, said his company had despatched a vaccine consignment to Niger at the request of the World Health Organization (WHO).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said the international aid agency, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) - Doctors without Borders had warned that company that drugs without any potent effect, counterfeits of the vaccine sent by the company, had been in use in Niger, but declined to give further details because of the ongoing legal investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legal sources said enquiries had so far been unable to reveal the exact number of false vaccines used.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two international enquiry teams ordered into Niger and Nigeria by the magistrate in charge of the investigation, had so far produced no results, informed sources said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lagos - Nigerian immigration officials have seized two boats which were about to smuggle out 78 Nigerian children to Gabon and Cameroon, allegedly for slave labour and prostitution, a press report said here on August 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The boats were seized in the border town of Oron, in the south- eastern state of Akwa Ibom independent, newspaper, The Guardian said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The children - 40 girls and 38 boys - aged between 11 and 17 years, were paraded at the immigration headquarters in Uyo, the state capital by the agency's spokesman, Okey Ezugwu, according to the report.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the children said that they were paid 10,000 CFA francs (US dollars 20) each as transport fare to go and work in farms and beaches in Gabon and Cameroon during the holidays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Due to financial hardships, the practice of exporting teenagers to Gabon, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea and Zaire for forced labour has been on the increase in the past few years, especially in Nigeria's south-eastern states of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Imo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The authorities in those states have launched a campaign against such practices and have arrested some parents, guardians and suspected members of a smuggling &quot;syndicate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of Nigeria's illegal immigrants expelled in the last two years from Gabon were children who had been smuggled in as slave labour or for sexual exploitation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The reports came only hours after United Nations findings released in Geneva, painted a horrifying picture of modern slavery, with half a million juvenile prostitutes in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 50 million cases of Indian child labour, and entire Nepalese families held in slavery for generations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report, made public on August 13, is based on lengthy investigations by parliamentary deputies and organizations in some 20 countries, and as it appeared, 250 young Indians aged six to 12 demonstrated in New Delhi against child slavery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An Asian group quoted by the UN report said more than 55 million Indian children are &quot;kept in servitude&quot; although slave labour was officially abolished 20 years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Africa, similar charges have been levelled against Sudan, which has been accused recently of capturing black children both in southern Sudan and northern Uganda to sell them as slaves to rich Arabs in the Gulf region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The accusations have come from human rights groups, churches and the southern rebels who have been battling Khartoum since 1983 to end domination of the mainly Christian and animist south by the Arabised, Muslim north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bloody civil war has left at least one million people dead and forced millions of others to either become displaced internally or to flee into exile in neighbouring countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Catholic bishop of El Obeid, the Rt. Rev. Macram Gasis, is seeking clarification over a peace pact on the problem of the Sudanese Nuba Mountains people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Gasis wants to know whether the people of the Nuba mountains were consulted when a group of rebels from the area, jointly with the Khartoum government signed on July 31 a &quot;Peace Charter&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">outlining a &quot;declaration of principles,&quot; with a view to resolving &quot;the Nuba mountains problem&quot; in a peaceful and democratic manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop observes that the international community had condemned the present regime, isolated and punished it through sanctions, because of widespread abuses and violations of human rights, particularly against African ethnic groups and non-Muslims.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop, whose diocese incorporates the Nuba mountains, also reiterates that slavery continues in the area today and &quot;it is well documented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He warns the signatories to the charter that &quot;history and their God will judge them.&quot; The signatory rebel group had withdrawn from key military posts in Col. John Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Macram wonders if &quot;these people think they are going to be credible with the regime when they move from one side to another.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bishop Macram spoke to APS on August 10 at the ordination of Rev. Remijo Lominong William as a priest of the Catholic Church in Sudan. He becomes the sixth Sudanese priest to be ordained in exile but will return to work in Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the rebels who signed the &quot;declaration of principles&quot; - in effect the Sudanese Government's initiated &quot;Peace Charter,&quot; are Commander Mohamed Haroun Kafi, Chairman of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army Nuba Mountains Central Committee and Engineer Abdelbagi Hamdan Kabeir, the committee's secretary for Foreign Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sudanese government delegation was led by Brigadier Hamad Abdel Karim Elsaid, Minister for Finance South Kordofan State, in which the Nuba Mountains is situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two parties recognised that there had been a long-standing problem in the Nuba Mountains &quot;which led to the armed struggle since 1984.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Further, they acknowledged &quot;the unity of Sudan with its geographical and political borders in 1956.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers noted that while the defections could damage the fortunes of the SPLA in the Nuba Mountains, a key rebel leader, Youssif Kawa, was not among the signatories.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kigali - Rwandan parliamentarians have approved a draft legislation that will be used to punish suspects in the ethnic genocide which culminated in the massacre of between 500,000 and one million people in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft law will allow the first trials of those accused of ethnic massacres to begin, Rwandan national radio reported here on August 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The legislation, approved on August 9, covered organization of judicial inquiries into breaches of the law which constitute genocide or other crimes against humanity, committed in Rwanda between October 1, 1990, and December 31, 1994. This period covers the civil war in Rwanda which preceded the genocide which took place between April and July 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">October 1, 1990 was the date on which the civil war in Rwanda began. The official radio station did not provide any further details on the text of the new law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under discussion since June, the draft law was sent before commissions because of differences of opinion between the parliament and the government, despite the fact both are dominated by the mainly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) which has been in power since July 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was adopted on by 47 votes in favour, with one against and five abstentions, according to Radio Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now the legislation must be put before the constitutional court before it is promulgated by Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 80,000 Hutus, most of them accused of taking part in the 1994 genocide, are festering in overcrowded prisons, provoking repeated criticism of conditions from international observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Joshua Amselmo, spokesman of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, that the Red Cross had registered 80,259 prisoners in 255 detention centres in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than 54,000 of them were being kept in the country's 14 jails, and more than 25,000 in temporary holding centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rwandan judicial apparatus was decimated by the 1994 killings and has only been rebuilt very gradually.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As yet, none of those presumed guilty of the genocide has been tried either in Rwanda or by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which is based in Arusha, northern Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a statement read on Radio Rwanda, the Rwanda government is &quot; very satisfied&quot; with the passing of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The General Secretary of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) Rev. Jose Chipenda has challenged trained Christian communicators to help the Church in Africa communicate the Christian message effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Knowledge acquired by Christian communicators should speed up the use of mass media by churches on the continent, said the AACC head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Angolan clergy noted that unlike in the past, today's church in Africa must rely on the use of mass media-print and electronic - hence the need for trained Christian communicators to help churches incorporate mass media usage.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Chipenda was speaking at the graduation ceremony here for the 1996 Media Production Course, organized and conducted by the AACC Communication Training Centre (CTC) for 19 participants from seven African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Graduands at the 14th graduation ceremony of the AACC/CTC included seven women. Countries represented were Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Ethiopia, Cote D'Ivoire, Botswana, and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Rev. Chipenda, professional training for Christian communicators is as vital as equipping communication centres, therefore churches should take the challenges posed by these needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC General Secretary also called on the course participants to return to their respective countries fully prepared to exploit the knowledge they had acquired during the six-month-media course at the centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the six-months period, participants were exposed to various aspects of mass media production such as photography, news reporting, script writing and studio techniques.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing the same gathering after judging photographs displayed by the students, renowned Kenyan photo-journalist Mohamed Amin, commended the high standard of creativity displayed through the pictures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some of the creativity displayed here is outside what I have witnessed in my 40 years experience in photography. It challenges churches, among other institutions to exploit them (students) for the betterment of mother Africa,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Amin, who told the gathering that he has taken up assignments in dangerous situations during his career spanning four decades cautioned, &quot; photo-journalism can be both exciting and dangerous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amin, who is the managing director of the Nairobi-based Camerapix, lost his hand in 1991 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, while covering the volatile aftermath of the fall of President Mengistu Haile Mariam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his address, the CTC communication consultant, Mr. Polycarp Omolo Ochilo, hailed churches for showing interest in training both men and women in mass media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The fact that we are today graduating men and women is a clear indication that the church is concerned about gender sensitivity,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his remarks, photo editor for the independent Nation Group of Newspapers,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Sam Ouma, who conducted the AACC/CTC photography course, expressed concern that &quot;there are very few female photographers in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At Nation (Kenya's mass circulation daily) for example, we have only one female photographer in the male-dominated area,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;women should be encouraged to venture into photography.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission said it has dispatched 19,000 quintals of relief aid to thousands of needy people affected by the recurrent flooding.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement it issued here, the commission said the aid was distributed in Afar, Somali, Ogaden and Gambella regions where major rivers had burst their banks and rendered thousands homeless.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Awash River Threatens Cotton:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dubti - the Awash River which diverted its normal course near Dubti, would threaten unless prompt measures are taken to maintain its usual route, an official of the plantation warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tefera-Work Haile, representative of the Tendaho Agricultural Development Enterprise, said unless the flow of the Awash River that diverted from its normal route around Feriti locality in Dubti woreda maintained its usual direction, the cotton plantation on 2485 hectares of land should be damaged in about two weeks time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Tefera-Work estimated the ensuing damage at 62 million birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said similar diversion in the flow of the river damaged 336 hectares of cotton plantation in Detbahri area early last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The representative added that workers of the enterprise, hard pressed by shortage of potable water, have appealed to abandon the area after the effort to redirect the flow of the river ended up in failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another 2,500 hectares of cotton plantation cultivated by investors and farmers in Detabahri area is also exposed to disastrous condition, be sides the passing of the sowing period for a further 5000 hectares of land prepared for cotton plantation, the representatives explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about the problem, Ato Kidane Asefa, head of the hydrology department under the Ministry of Water Resources and other experts in the office told ENA that the implementation of the design that included the digging of a 500 metre canal to reverse the flow of the river to its previous direction began yesterday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry said in a statment a vaccination centre located on the premises of the Black Lion Hospital is administering yellow fever vaccines for overseas travellers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministry said travellers are often seen coming to the centre to get certified only two days ahead of their scheduled travel but, it said, entertaining such demands are incompatible with the objectives of the vaccination and cannot help the user either.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the vaccination to be more effective and save travellers the inconvenience they suffer to get it due to time limitation, travellers are required to get immunised 10 days before their travel programme, the ministry said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ministry said it is checking on the entry of diseases labelled communicable internationally at hygiene and quarantine stations set up at major air and land outlets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Being a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) , Ethiopia adheres to laws, regulations and directives given by WHO and makes health controll in incomint passengers, goods, transportation and corpses, the ministry said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Farmers who will be found by Lima Bank to be unworthy of debt relief will not be protected by the government, the Ministry of Agriculture has warned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a letter of July 19, agriculture deputy minister Matthias Mpande advised Lima Bank to give debt relief only to those who deserve it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Base your loan recoveries on a case by case basis,&quot; Mpande directed Lima Bank managing director, Venus Kasapatu. &quot;Ministry officials are being requested to assist you fulfill your loan recoveries programme.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpande assured Lima Bank the ministry will not interfere in any loan recoveries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the government's position has not gone well with many farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We thought that our debts would be repaid by the government through the scheme but these agents are coming to us to repay the 1994/95 loans which we failed to pay because of the drought,&quot; complained Lydia Mbewe of Chipata in an interview. &quot;My name appears on the list of loanees in the debt relief scheme but I was told by the agent here that the scheme would no longer apply to my case.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But things have not progressed as to expectations since President Frederick Chiluba's announcement of the debt relief to farmers over a year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have not been able to fully implement the scheme due to the fact that the memorandum of understanding has not been executed,&quot; Lima Bank managing director Kasapato explained the delay to his branch managers in a circular July 16.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And in an interview on Friday Kasapato said he had been assured of the government's commitment to debt relief.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am assuring you that the memorandum of understanding will be processed soon,&quot; assured agriculture deputy minister W.C Matutu in a letter of July 10 to Lima bank. &quot; I am appealing to your organisation to stop harassing the farmers and taking them to court until the issue is resolved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasapato, however, said Lima Bank has lists of farmers who are deserving. &quot; But other farmers engaged in poultry, for example, also signed up saying they could not repay because of the drought,&quot; Kasapato carped. &quot; We shall not accept such reasons. That is why the government has decided that we go through the lists and take them case by case.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Jury System Simplified</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi judiciary has come up with a cost-cutting means of speeding up trials for the 800 outstanding murder cases. It is to start engaging jurors who commute from their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy High Court Registrar, Bikitu Qoto, said the new system, which will also apply to jurors on treason cases, will cut hotel accommodation expenses for the jurors who will, however, continue to be provided with security and other services such as food and sitting allowances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Qoto said trial by jury, which is required by the country's constitution, is too costly for the judiciary which depends on government subventions affected by the cash-budget system. He cited the year long murder trial of several MCP officials, including former president Kamuzu Banda, which cost Malawi K3 million (US 200,000).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament has already passed the bill and it is now awaiting presidential approval. The bill allows any juror to sit for murder or treason trials.  Previously jurors were required to come from the accused's district of origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some lawyers, however, argue that the jury system should be dispensed with because it delays trial and pending cases. They say that its introduction was ill-timed and wrongly prioritised for the marginally poor Malawi, which is the only country using the system in the SADC region. They argue that the country would benefit more by investing in the training of lawyers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malawi To Discuss Deportees With South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi Human Rights Commission has been meeting with South African human rights organisations to find ways of easing the suffering of Malawian deportees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ombudsman James Chirwa, who co-chairs the commission with Law Commissioner Elton</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Singini, said in an interview that the commission had collected names of some of the Malawians due for repatriation and would raise their plight at the meeting with South African human rights bodies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has in recent months gone on a spree repatriating Malawians with dubious residence permits. Those repatriated usually leave without their assets and are thus subjected to undue hardships during the repatriation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chirwa and Singini are also linking up with their South African counterparts on the setting up of the offices of the Ombudsman, Law Commissioner and the Human Rights Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African High Commissioner, Llewelyn Crewe-Brown, said his government would not change its repatriation policies and would continue to repatriate people without proper travel documents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said those who complain about leaving their assets can always arrange to pick them up with their lawyers. He also said that it was difficult to release those found without proper travel documents so they could organise their assets because of the risk of their running away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He did, however, dismiss allegations that South Africa might be treating Malawians with a heavy hand because of the Malawi government's stand during the apartheid era. Malawi was one of very few countries in Africa which openly allied with the white-led apartheid government. Malawi was also not supportive of countries and organisations such as the ANC which were fighting to dismantle the system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bureau To Probe Corruption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly launched Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), has said it will review all reports of enquiries into alleged corruption, such as the Fieldyork notebook scam involving Malawi's ex-minister of education, Sam Mpasu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mysterious fire that gutted the offices of the Petroleum Control Commission, destroying vital information into the diverting of funds to private use by some officers, will also be screened, the bureau's director Gilton Chiwaula said on August 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiwaula said the bureau was empowered to review all enquiries into allegations of corruption made by other institutions to find out how serious they are for possible prosecution of culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked on whether the bureau would specifically investigate the Fieldyork notebook scandal, involving the procurement of notebooks by Sam Mpasu in 1994, Chiwaula said that there was no doubt that they would do this, &quot;especially now the public are demanding that we do so&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mpasuwho, who by-passed all government procedures in the purchase of the notebooks, is alleged to have received hefty kickbacks from the deal with a UK-based company. Mpasu denies the charge. President Bakili Muluzi, bowing to public pressure and keen to clear his government from corruption charges, replaced Mpasu as education minister and then later dropped him completely from the cabinet, but gave him the party portfolio of Secretary General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiwaula said the bureau would also review fraud enquiry reports into the PCC, the Development of Malawian Trust, whose general manager and a senior officer are on suspension, and into the Lilongwe city council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack Of Burial Space Brings Problems</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian (CCAP), in the Blantyre synod, may as well get used to the idea of having their bodies cremated when they die.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The church's general secretary, Rev Misanjo Kansilanga, is convinced that this is the only solution to the problem of a shortage of burial space in Blantyre's cemeteries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansilanga said the public should shed the belief that cremation of bodies was not compatible with African beliefs and traditions. He said the large numbers of burials being conducted at the church's cemetery in Blantyre, which is nearly full, had prompted the synod to restrict further burials to its church members only. He said the synod had written to the City of Blantyre to come to the rescue of the church but, up to now, there had been no response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In fact the city is also facing the same problem. It has already closed a number of its own cemeteries in the city because they are full.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kansilanga said there was a need to start teaching people to accept the idea of cremation, acknowledging that he was aware of the resistance the suggestion would meet due to deep- rooted African beliefs and traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">K160 Million In Unpaid Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Companies, government departments and the general public are depriving the government of K160 million (US 10.06 million) in unpaid tax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to redress this situation and improve the situation of the government coffers, the department of income tax has threatened to confiscate the property of all companies and individuals who fail to honour their tax obligations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Income Tax is the second biggest revenue generating department for the government, after Customs and Excise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the unpaid tax is due to tax evasion while a considerable part is also played by employers who deliberately delay remitting the taxes deducted from their employers, giving preference to other commitments, said Yvensio Chimombo, Commissioner of Taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Included among those owing the department money after deducting 'pay as you earn' (PAYE)funds from their employees, are some government departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chimombo said the time was up for tax defaulters. His department could no longer sit back while some unscrupulous people and organisations swindled the government of its much-needed revenue. He said that the law would take its course against culprits by confiscating their property which they could redeem upon payment of their tax dues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opposition Retains Seats</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The opposition Malawi Congress Party and Alliance for Democracy retained their parliamentary seats in a by-election held on July 29 in Nsanje, south Malawi, and Nkhata-Bay, in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCP won by a small margin the hotly contested Nsanje Lalanje seat vacated due to the death of Chimalizeni Sabola in March this year.MCP's candidate, Sylvestor Vazhi, scooped 3090 votes against 2795 votes for United Democratic Front's Ibrahim Phoso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Nkhata-Bay Aford's Austin Mwenda overwhelmingly beat his contenders by 4470 votes against 1475 for his runner up katantha Banda of the MCP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both polls were characterised by voter apathy with less than 33% of registered voters polling in both by-elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ruling UDF has protested against the results of both the polls alleging electoral fraud and has called for a re-run. The Electoral Commission is withholding the results following the protest and has since started investigations into the alleged irregularities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street Drug Vendors Challenge President</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Street vendors selling unprescribed drugs in the city of Blantyre have challenged president Bakili Muluzi, who on July 31 ordered police to assist in cracking down on the illegal business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muluzi said that apart from being illegal, the drugs were being stolen from government hospitals. This, he said, was one of the reasons for the shortage of drugs in these hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vendors, however, who sell anything from aspirin to drugs for treating tuberculosis, are unmoved by the threat, and have challenged the president to prove to them that the drugs are being stolen from hospitals. The vendors have also challenged the police to arrest them saying the law on the sale of drugs is very weak.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hospital authorities say theft of drugs by health personnel is rampant and contributes to the shortage of medicines in the hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Government Considering Value Added Tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Malawi government is considering the introduction of value added tax, to replace the surtax system that is currently in force on manufactured goods and services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controller of Customs and Excise, Ernest Mtingwi, and Commissioner for Tax, Yvensio Chimombo, said studies would be conducted on how best to introduce the new tax as one way of boosting government's revenue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mtingwi said the VAT system was already working in many countries, such as South Africa and neighbouring Zambia, and said there should be no problem introducing it in Malawi. VAT is tax levied on the rise in value of a product at each stage of its manufacture. It is thus expected to earn government more revenue than surtax.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - About 40 sets of twins have become the focus of a pilot observational study at a special clinic at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre to determine the effect of HIV infection on twins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Ronin Broadhead of Malawi College of Medicine, the paediatrician who is leading the research team, said one of the reasons for the two-year study was to find out the degree of risk of HIV infection and the effect of HIV on twins. &quot;For sometime now it has been known that the first twin is much more at risk of developing AIDS than the second twin,&quot; he said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the college, in conjunction with John Hopkins University in the USA, carried out a study to see whether by washing the vaginal canal, HIV transmission could be interrupted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said this had not, however, been proved so. It is, however, presumed that contact of the baby with vaginal secretions might have an effect on increasing the risk of HIV infection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our interest in twins continues because their mortality rate is high especially when mothers have big families and have to look after two babies at once.&quot; Mothers often find that one baby, the stronger one, dominates over the second, and the survival rate of the second twin is often much less than the single baby, he said. He also said that another objective of the study was to find out whether it was possible to improve the lives of both twins by running regular clinics and monitoring them carefully in the antenatal period and after the birth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the study also looks at different types of the virus as it is now known that HIV is not just a single type. &quot;It changes and replicates itself making 'cousins' which are related but slightly different in their actual form.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Broadhead said that he hopes the clinic will go on indefinitely providing services for mothers with twins. He said that twins always present a challenge and he hopes the study would help improve the outcome for both twins, adding that it was good clinical practice to run a clinic for a certain risk group such as mothers with twins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The central hospital has several advantages for the study, one being that it has from 13,000 to 14,000 babies delivered annually and it is hoped that the study will be able to gather information on at least 100 pairs of twins each year. The prevalence of HIV in delivering women is over 30% with the perinatal transmission rate established at 28%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that one in 40 mothers deliver twins, while in Europe it is one to every 80 births. Professor Broadhead said the biological reasons for this difference are not clearly understood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All twins delivered at QECH are eligible to be enrolled into the study, after informed consent for HIV testing is obtained from parents.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre - Malawi has said it was not certain if it had benefited from its membership to regional groupings like the Southern African Development Community (SADC), or the Common Market for Eastern Southern Africa (COMESA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a seminar on a study of economic integration in Southern Africa, Malawi's Deputy Finance Minister Lizzie Lossa lamented that Malawi had not benefited from most of the grouping's programmes and activities put in place to promote socio-economic development in member countries.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said there was presently a big trade imbalance between Malawi and some of its trading partners in the region in favour of other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said that although Malawi's benefits from such bodies could obviously not benefit those of other countries with bigger economies, like Zimbabwe and South Africa, there was need for the region to aim at greater regional integration and stability.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The morbid state of Zambia's national book industry has kept the country in a state of intellectual isolation from the rest of the world, said Ministry of Education permanent secretary, Sichalwe Kasanda, in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the Symposium on National Book Policy for Zambia at Lusaka's Mulungushi international Conference Centre, Kasanda said &quot;it is a situation that should make us all uncomfortable because it has a direct bearing on the speed of our development as a country, let alone as individuals&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kasanda, however, assured all these concerns had been finally addressed in the draft National Book Policy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The policy seeks to create a Book Development Council of Zambia under the auspices of the Ministry of Education to execute and bring to fruition the aspirations expressed therein,&quot; Kasanda said. &quot;Due care has been taken, as far as practically possible, to embrace the needs of all stakeholders - ranging from the writer who is the originator of the book, through to the reader who is the ultimate beneficiary in the chain.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Programme Specialist in Education from the UNESCO subregional office for southern Africa in Harare, Mauno Mbamba, said Zambia had taken a leading role in the process of developing a national book policy of the five countries that took part in the launching of the Study on Textbook Provision and the Feasibility of Cooperation among SADC member states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Zambia took full advantage of the consultations with other countries in the sub-region, as facilitated by UNESCO, and moved forward to initiating practical measures at the international level for achieving ideal conditions for the provision of textbooks and books in general,&quot; Mamba said, adding: &quot; Although Zimbabwe and Namibia have established a national Book Development Council, and Botswana and Malawi have expressed the need to create such an institution, none of these countries has reached the stage where Zambia is today, namely the formulation of a national book policy.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Unless the thin rail tracks are repaired Lusaka's Njanji commuter train will not last over two years unless, warned the company's general manger Peter Muche in an interview yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Muche said the thin rail tracks which were designed for much lighter trains cannot withstand the heavy equipment now in use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When the Njanji Commuter started the equipment used was lighter, but the coaches and locomotives were replaced when people complained that the Mulungushi coaches were of inferior quality,&quot; Muche said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But according to Muche, the government says it can only repair the rail tracks after this year's presidential and general elections due to budget constraints.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have already put this matter before the government but they explained to us that it cannot be financed because of the coming elections,&quot; Muche said.  &quot;We would appreciate four rail cars and six coaches which would cost over US$5 million but it would be a good investment in the long run because then we could hope to run this service for a long time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Ministry of Transport permanent secretary,Ronald Mukuma, in an interview yesterday, said the government was conscious of the importance of the commuter train and that is why it has &quot;kept the fares low on that train because it is a public service&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The renovations to that train were not included in the budget but we can expect them to be included in the next budget,&quot;Mukuma said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fare for the longest distance covered by the Njanji commuter train, Lusaka to Ngwerere or Lusaka to Lilayi, is K200.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Muche said the commuter train is able to meet all its general costs having collected about K380 million in fares last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It looks like we will do the same this year in spite of stiff competition from mini-bus operators,&quot; Muche said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Siavonga - A new policy aimed at improving the portrayal of women in the media is being development by the government, disclosed permanent secretary in the newly established Gender in Development Division (GIDD), Grace Mulapezi, in Siavonga yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening a training workshop for media personnel on Gender, Population and Development in Siavonga yesterday, Mulapezi complained that women issues that are positive are rarely portrayed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Instead negative and scandalous issues make headlines in the media,&quot; Mulapezi said. &quot;In line with this apart from the national gender policy that is yet to be considered by cabinet, a media policy that will include gender issues is being developed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at the same function, assistant director at GIDD Edwidge Mutale said &quot;integration of gender aspect in development strategies came as a result of failure of economic development strategies to raise the status of women&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In some cases, economic growth oriented development left women worse of than they were before,&quot; Mutale said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And demographer at GIDD, Joe Kapembwa, explained that gender is often confused with sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Gender is a social economic valuable used to analyse the roles, responsibilities, contributions and potentials of women and men which gives rise to the social relation between them,&quot; Kapembwa said.&quot; There is a big difference between the two.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">GIDD was established two months ago to replace the former Women In Development (WID) who it was felt had left out women from the mainstream of development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Advocates if WID felt that to integrate women in development, there was need to set up women's projects but this left women farther marginalised,&quot; Mutale said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chipata - Over K6 billion will this year be earned by Eastern Province farmers from cotton sales to South Africa's Clark Cotton Limited which bought Lintco's Chipata branch under the privatisation programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eastern Province farmers are this year expected to produce about 16 million kilogrammes of cotton - almost double that of last season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clark Cotton's ginnery manager, James Chisenga, in an interview in Chipata on Friday, attributed the increase in cotton production to good rains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are expecting between 15 and 16 million Kilogrammes of cotton this season , and at K440 per kilogramme, we will spend quite a lot because we have to make sure we buy all the produce,&quot; Chisenga said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And over 60 per cent of cotton is of excellent quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far the over 8 million Kilo- grammes we have received, about 69 per cent of it is of A grade, it is of excellent quality,&quot; cotton quality controller Andrew Ndjovu said in an interview in Chipata on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Njovu was worried about inadequate cotton storage facilities&quot;All the 16 million Kilogrammes of cotton have to be processed before the start of the rain season as the storage facilities are worrying,&quot; Njovu carped. &quot;We have to improve on these facilities in future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Njovu, however, assured that it takes time for cotton to be spoiled, even if it is soaked, so long it is processed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And according to Eastern Province permanent secretary, Harry Mutonga, the area has done well in the agriculture sector and there are no fears for starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I think we are very safe this season and we will make sure all the produce is bought as we have plenty of grain bags and there are no marketing problems, &quot; Mtonga said in an interview in Chipata on Friday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The government should seriously consider dialogue before going ahead with elections using the amended Constitution, advised the Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ) chairman, Griffin Nyirongo, yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyirongo, in an interview yesterday, said &quot;there is still room for discussion&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The manner in which the Constitution was adopted was not conclusive,&quot; Nyirongo said. &quot;The uncertainty surrounding the constitution has made it difficult for the country to attract investment.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government, Nyirongo advised, should &quot;take a conciliatory stand and meet the opposition parties halfway towards the resolution of the current donor freeze&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even the suspense over the date of elections needs to be cleared up because the suspicion it creates makes economic agents wary and they tend to be speculative, not committing themselves to any investments,&quot;Nyirongo said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And EAZ programmes coordinator, Muna Nakalonga, in an interview yesterday, said &quot;the players in the political arena should come together immediately&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;People should stop being proud because there is nothing to be proud about.  A whole year has passed by without growth,&quot; Nakalonga said. &quot; All the MMD government was required to do was to maintain donor-financed projects but even this might fail simply because the donors will completely cut off aid if we go with this Constitution to next year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) chairman, David Matongo, at the association's monthly meeting last Wednesday said the country needed &quot;political stability if this economy is to progress&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on the Stock Market and the Economy last Wednesday, investment consultant, Zoran Zuze, said the political situation in the country was affecting the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although there is no crisis in the form of a mass uprising, our government has decided to pass a constitution which on the face of it, appears as though it was designed to curtail opposition and extend its stay in power,&quot; Zuze said. &quot;It has also imprisoned opponents on treason charges apparently with no evidence. This has created a lot of uncertainty in the economy especially in the wake of the donor aid withdrawals.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zuze pointed to the effects of foreign exchange shortages and gave an example of Chilanga Cement Plc's shares which were going at K54 around the announcement of the ZCCM privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since these political developments the shares have fallen to back to K48,&quot; Zuze said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But finance minister Ronald Penza yesterday refused to give a conclusive answer to the requests made by the economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I stand by what I said on Sunday's television programme,&quot; Penza maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penza told the nation on ZNBC television's Open Fire programme on Sunday that the elections would be held with or without donor funding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations - United Nations Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali has warned the international community to be prepared for the possibility of a genocide in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his latest report to the UN Security Council released Wednesday, the secretary-general said while the UN might be willing to help in any contingency plan for a military intervention, it could not carry it out alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The UN is ready to help, within its limited capacity,&quot; he said, adding, &quot; But I am convinced that it is a delusion to think that such an operation could be planned, deployed and commanded by the UN as if it were a peace- keeping operation.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary-general said if the situation in Burundi exploded, &quot;military intervention to save lives might become an inescapable imperative,&quot; irrespective of what the government of Burundi, which is opposed to any foreign intervention, might think.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He disclosed that the UN had been pursuing a two-track approach - a possible peace-keeping mission and a multinational force - in its contingency plan for a rapid humanitarian response in the event of widespread violence in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But his report also indicated that the approaches had not recorded much success in terms of the number of countries willing to make troops contribution or offer financial, logistic or material assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the report, only 14 of 86 countries approached by the UN to indicate what contribution they might be prepared to make to a peace-keeping mission, responded positively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the multinational force, the report said, only 10 of the nearly 50 countries contacted by the UN have responded positively, and only three of that number -- Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania -- have offered troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The response of member states to the secretariat's efforts... to canvass support for intervention in Burundi has thus not yet matched the urgency and seriousness of the situation in that country,&quot; the secretary-general said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said in view of the poor response, some member states had suggested that the UN consider planning, organizing and conducting the force, as well as the possibility of its being financed through assessed contribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the secretary-general noted that with the force expected to reach about 50,000, &quot;I have doubts about the willingness of member states to provide troops for an operation on this scale or to finance it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said the UN had written to 30 potential troop contributors to assess their reactions to the possibility, adding, &quot;It is necessary to leave no stone upturned in the search for ways to help save Burundi from the cataclysm which threatens it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi has been in turmoil since 1993, when the first democratically- elected president was killed in a failed coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since then, an estimated 150,000 people have been killed in incessant violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A July 25 coup in which Maj. Pierre Buyoya replaced President Sylvestre Ntibantungaya has increased the fear of further deterioration in the situation, amid biting sanctions from neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - An organisation known as &quot;The Mwalimu Nyerere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foundation&quot; has been created in Tanzania for the purpose of promoting peace, unity and people-centered development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a document received by PANA in Dakar Wednesday, the foundation &quot;will seek to fulfill those purposes by encouraging and as necessary organizing dialogues within Africa, among and between governments, peoples, and local institutions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Formally registered in June 1996, the foundation seeks to perpetuate the local and international efforts of Julius Nyerere, the &quot;Founding Father&quot; of independent Tanganyika, which got its independence from Britain on Dec.9, 1961.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere was also &quot;Co-Founding Father&quot; and the first President of Tanzania, which was created by merging Tanganyika and the Indian Ocean islands of Zanzibar in April 1964. He was re-elected four times, refusing to stand in the presidential elections of 1985.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The foundation &quot;will work on the basis that neither peace, unity, nor development can be secure within or between countries unless the attitudes and institutions upholding them are rooted in the people and ultimately under their control.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been established as &quot;an intellectually independent body not linked to any political party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will initiate, encourage and assist the development of action-oriented proposals based on the sharing of experience, ideas, and knowledge, among governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To pursue its own objectives more effectively, the foundation will seek to cooperate with other institutions - within and outside Africa - which have similar purposes, or whose purposes overlap with its own.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While it will be independent of all governments and is separate from academic and other non-governmental institutions, &quot;the Foundation hopes to be able, as appropriate, to work with them, or assist them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, it will also promote the study of the principles adopted and practiced by Nyerere who introduced a socialist policy known as &quot;Ujamaa&quot; based on the African traditional family and village life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;To that end, the foundation will collect, analyze, catalogue and care for documents, letters speeches, interviews, reports and other information concerning Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The idea of establishing a &quot;Nyerere Center&quot; was first raised in 1986 after his retirement. It resurfaced at different times in the University of Dar es Salaam, among informal discussion groups, and among individuals discussing either the history or the future of Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finally, a group of individuals from government service, from the University, and from the private sector, persuaded Nyerere to allow their ideas to develop in a coherent and co-ordinated manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is intended that the foundation will be a modest-sized institution, pursuing its objectives economically and without ostentation in conformity with the example set by Mwalimu Nyerere himself throughout his life and work.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document sent to PANA said a temporary office has been opened in Dar es Salaam's Sokoine Drive, while contributions towards the foundation have already started coming in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nyerere is currently chairman of the Geneva-based &quot;South Center&quot; the successor of the South Commission, which was established by the Non-Aligned Movement in 1986 to promote economic dialogue among developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was also mediating in the Burundian ethnic conflict before the military takeover by the Tutsi-dominated army in Bujumbura on July 25.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe has registered an upshot of between</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12 to 86 percent in measles cases in the last two months, despite government's immunization programme of children aged five years and below.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ministry of health and child welfare official said in an interview over the weekend that most of the measle cases were among children over five years old.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said government was currently formulating strategies of eliminating measles in Zimbabwe, following a recent outbreak of the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nearly 5,500 measles cases have been reported in 1996 with 30 deaths, an increase from about 2,500 cases reported at the same time in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The official said 576 new cases of measles were reported during the week- ending Aug. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have been experiencing a sharp increase over the past few weeks and the majority of these cases are among children over five years old. We are looking at how the English-speaking Caribbean has managed to reduce measle cases to almost zero,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On malaria, the official said the national trend surprisingly showed an increase of 18 percent in the number of cases reported during the week-ending Aug. 4.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a total of 8,865 cases with eight deaths were reported countrywide during the week under review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malaria has so far killed 1,664 people in Zimbabwe in 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUANDA, Angola - Angola has deported 165 Malian, Sierra Leonian,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Gambian and Lebanese immigrants, Angolan police announced Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Aircraft of the Angolan airline, TAAG, were chartered to carry the deportees as part of a police operation code-named &quot;Cancer II&quot;, which started on August 8, to track and repatriate foreign nationals involved in illegal practices in the country.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last Saturday, about 150 immigrants, mainly Africans, were deported from Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation has spread to other parts of the country, especially in the provinces of Lunda-Norte and Lunda-Sul, where 250 immigrants from Zaire, Mali, Gambia and Guinea, accused of illegal diamond deals, have been arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since the beginning of the operation, one Frenchman, one Lebanese-born North-American, four Indians and one Chinese have been among the deportees, the majority of whom were Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The operation has so far led to the arrest of 748 illegal immigrants from 26 countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Senegal's foreign ministry has said the deportation of several hundred immigrants from West, Central and East Africa is &quot;difficult to accept&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a statement released to the Senegalese news agency Tuesday, the ministry regretted that &quot;such measures are taken by African states against African nationals whatever the reasons or justifications given.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Current negotiations are rather advanced but deportations are continuing,&quot; the ministry said, adding that the Senegalese government will make every effort so that a solution based on principles is found and practical modalities adopted to protect African nationals in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Eighty-six Senegalese deportees arrived in Dakar August 13, on board a Taag plane chartered by Luanda. They were taken care of by the foreign ministry in cooperation with the crisis committee chaired by President Abdou Diouf's chief-of-staff.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riverside - The Center for Women in Coalition at the University of California, Riverside is organizing a conference, &quot;Frontline Feminisms: Women, War, and Resistance&quot; to take place on campus January 16-18, 1997.  Participants will discuss the forging of new feminisms in the context of militarized situations around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference aims to link feminist activist and grass-roots organizers engaged in innovative feminist praxes with a gathering of scholars and policy- makers engaged in theorizing conflict and promoting cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Featured participants will include women from the Balkans, the Middle East, Central America, South Asia, the Philippines, Africa, and the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workshop, film/video, visual art, creative writing and paper proposals are due August 1. All scholars and activists interested in attending are invited to send their mailing and/or e-mail addresses to the organizers for inclusion on the mailing list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference registration will be $30 ($15 for students) and modestly-priced lodging will be available. (Registration and lodging can be waived in case of need.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The conference is international in scope and we are interested in flying activists from different parts of the world. This is of course dependent on funding. We have invited women associated with the politics of the Balkans, South Asia, Central America/Mexico, Israel and Palestine, Iran, and hope to expand our contacts in sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and South America.  However, we are particularly interested in creating linkages between local and national activists and scholars with women from other parts of the world.  In southern California, there is a richness of activism among Mexican- American, Native American Asian- American communities and we will be tapping into these regional networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirmed speakers include: Vasanthi Raman, Senior Fellow, Center for Women's Development Studies, New Delhi; Soona Samsami, Member Foreign Affairs Committee, National Council of Iran; Gila Svirsky, Member and Founder, Women in Black Advisory Council, Israel Women's Network; Rachel Wareham, Activist and Trainer; Motrat Qiriazi-Rural women activists; Kosovo Kemi Oyarzun, Founder, Center for Women's Studies, Santiago, Chile. This list does not include the many academic scholars who have either committed themselves to, or expressed interest in, participating. Also, we are working with the rich network of activist groups in Southern California that are addressing issues such as immigration, political asylum, and labor, which are closely linked with struggles elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The conversations will not only connect the &quot;global&quot; and the &quot;local&quot; they will also connect the &quot;academic&quot; with the &quot;practical&quot;. As such, we are welcoming all sorts of texts and discourses -- papers can follow the conventions of academic conferencing, but they can also include creative writing, photodocumentary essays, installations, film/video. They can and will be bi or tri-lingual and interpreters will be on hand! We hope that conversations are multiple, linking scholars with activists, poets, artists and whatever intersections and permutations of both. There will be panel presentations, workshops and films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We remain open -- in policy -- to any ideas and creative possibilities which we can accomodate within the constraints we have: time and money. So please do get in touch with us -- about people both here and internationally who we could contact. We are already heartened by the enthusiasm which is seeping in from all quarters of global cyber-space and will follow any &quot;lead&quot; you suggest. Please note again that our funding IS limited in terms of being able to pay for air-tickets but we are going to be creative about good but cheap accommodation in Riverside -- and transportation within the area (to and from airports etc).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. We are also committed to trying to financially assist women who are not connected to any sources of conventional funding (university, foundations etc) and who will be prohibited because of financial inability to pay for train/plane tickets, housing etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. We are also planning to put together an anthology of writing about these issues (again both academic and other kinds of work) which will be published.  We intend to archive (both in text and video) the conference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toronto - Inaugurated in 1995 to both critical and audience acclaim, Planet Africa returns as a regular part of the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival, presenting films from Africa and the African diaspora. Programmed by Cameron Bailey, Planet Africa includes six world premieres in a programme of eight features and five short films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We generated a lot of enthusiasm last year with a modest slate of films,&quot; says Bailey. &quot;This year we're back with a larger programme including several world premieres and more films from more of the African world. We've covered the continent more broadly with films from southern, northern and western Africa, as well as other parts of the Diaspora. This year establishes Toronto as the place in North America to see new African film each year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following are the films featured in this year's Planet Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN THE STARS MEET THE SEA (QUAND LES ETOILES RENCONTRENT LA MER) - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Raymond Rajaonarivelo, Madagascar/France, 1996 Madagascar's pre- eminent filmmaker establishes his place at the forefront of African cinema with this majestic film taking his story from a particularly resonant Malagasy myth. A boy, born on the day of an eclipse in a small village, is believed to possess great and dangerous powers. As a test, he must endure one night alone among the cattle. But a childless young woman rescues him, forever changing his fate. This startlingly beautiful film reveals Madagascar as one of the last magical places on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARISTOTLE'S PLOT - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Jean-Pierre Bekolo, Zimbabwe/France, 1996 ARISTOTLE'S PLOT began as the African entry in the British Film Institute's commemoration of the centenary of cinema. Instead of a respectful documentary like Martin Scorsese's US contribution, Bekolo serves up a wild hybrid that's half meditation on the trials of African moviemaking, half action movie send-up.  In a southern African town, a group of wannabe gangsters hangs out at the Cinema Africa, megadosing on the latest actionfest while assuming the names of their screen gods: Van Damme, Bruce Lee, Nikita, Saddam, and the leader, Cinema. Enter an earnest cineaste, trying in vain to enlist the government's help in cleansing the Cinema Africa of Hollywood contamination, replacing Schwarzenegger with Ousmane Sembene. Taking matters into his own hands, he becomes a vigilante for a home-grown film culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERYONE'S CHILD - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Tsitsi Dangarembga, Zimbabwe, 1996. In her debut feature, Commonwealth Writer's Prize-winning playwright and novelist Tsitsi Dangarembga distills the statistics of the millions of African children orphaned because of AIDS. When their parents die suddenly, Tamari and her brother Itai must fend for both themselves and their younger siblings. Itai heads to Harare, where local hoods take him in and train him in the ways of the street. Back in the village, Tamari accepts the advances of a lecherous shopkeeper. As she tries to use his gifts to pay for her siblings' schooling, the village women suggest she leave, to keep the village safe for their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN HENRIK CLARKE: A GREAT AND MIGHTY WALK - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: St. Clair Bourne, USA, 1996. African-American historian John Henrik Clarke is a legend among scholars. Born into sharecropping, self- taught long before he entered academia, he possesses an astounding knowledge of the roots and branches of African history. He's also a great talker.  Veteran documentarian St. Clair Bourne (MAKING DO THE RIGHT THING) lets the man do just that in this remarkable documentary, weaving Clarke's words into a mix of archival treasures and image manipulation. From ancient Egypt, we move through the Mediterranean, Africa's great empires, the slave trade, and African American history right up to the Million Man March. Though now blind, Clarke has lost none of his razor-sharp edge. &quot;If you lose your eyesight,&quot; he says, &quot;increase your insight.&quot; Narrated and executive produced by Wesley Snipes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SUMMER IN LA GOULETTE (UN ETE A LA GOULETTE) - North American Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Ferid Boughedir, Tunisia/France/Belgium, 1995 Ferid Boughedir's first film since his acclaimed HALFAOUINE is a sly comedy full of warmth, wit and exuberance, as he crafts a glorious portrait of a Tunisian resort neighbourhood where Muslims, Christians and Jews live side by side. It's the summer of 1967, and three teenage girls vow to lose their virginity by the festive Day of the Madonna. As events come to a boil, reports filter in about a potential war in the Middle East. But the people of La Goulette are captivated by more immediate news -- the nation's most treasured daughter, the celestial Claudia Cardinale (playing herself), is returning from Europe for a triumphant visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MACADAM TRIBE (MACADAM TRIBU)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Jose Laplaine, France/Zaire/Mali, 1996 Laplaine's lively, comic first feature weaves unemployment, lust and family commitments into a series of scenes-from-the-quarter. Mike is an ex-con and layabout, while his brother Kapa spends his time boxing with his amateur-fighter friend Duka. The brothers are deeply concerned about their mother, Mother Bavusi, a former market woman who now spends her days quietly getting drunk. When Duka is knocked into a coma, the whole neighborhood of strivers, whores and amateur philosophers rallies together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WATERMELON WOMAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Cheryl Dunye, USA, 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This debut feature from one of America's leading indie media stars, is fierce, funny and genuinely romantic. Dunye plays Cheryl, whose main passion is a forgotten black act or credited only as the Watermelon Woman. Frustrated by slim pickings on the dating front, Cheryl puts her energy into tracking down her mystery mammy. Moving effortlessly between fiction and mock documentary, Dunye reclaims the history of black-cast movies as she affectionately skewers the coupling habits of downtown Philadelphia lesbians.  Meanwhile, Cheryl falls for a flirty white girl named Diana, (GO FISH discovery Guin Turner). Cameo by legendary motormouth and lesbian icon Camille Paglia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">W.E.B. DU BOIS: A BIOGRAPHY IN FOUR VOICES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Direcotr: Louis Massiah, USA, 1996. Dr. William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868 - 1963) stands as one of America's greatest scholars and political activists. His life story, spanning the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, the rise of Communism and Pan-Africanism, and the Civil Rights Movement, is chronicled by four leading African-American writers: Toni Cade Bambara, Amiri Baraka, Wesley Brown, and Thulani Davis. This richly woven visual history explores the major strategies for African-American empowerment during the 20th Century.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Defence lawyers on Thursday asked a Lusaka Court trying eight opposition politicians for treason, to charge Zambia's Inspector- General of Police, Francis Ndhlovu, for perjury after it was proved he lied to the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlovu is a key state witness in the trial of the opposition leaders, for a spate of bombings which has rocked the southern African country in past months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence lawyers asked that the police boss be charged with perjury after it was found that he lied when he said on oath he had no knowledge of a group which called itself 'Mad-Max, Dogs of the War' which claimed it planted bombs.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlovu was giving evidence in the continued treason trial of the eight members of the United National Independence Party (UNIP), who have been charged with treason and murder, following their alleged link with the 'Black Mamba' group, accused of being responsible for the bomb explosions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief had earlier during cross-examination claimed the Mad-Max group were fictitious. So he had been unable to make any arrests which linked them to the bombs, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he was proved to have lied when a defence lawyer, Sakwiba Sikota, produced a deposition of a former intelligent officer, Christopher Mukoka, from the mad-max group, that Ndhlovu agreed that he knew Mukoka personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I pray to this court that the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who is right here in court, representing the state, issue instruction to charge the Inspector-General of Police with perjury since, under oath, he has told the court lies,&quot; Sikota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When high court judge Peter Chitengi asked the DPP, Gregory Phiri, whether he had reactions to Sikota's request, Phiri replied: &quot;No Reactions, My Lord.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The defence argued that the state was aware of the Mad-Max group, because it employed the group to plant bombs in order to frame the opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also said the Mad-Max comes under the Central Joined Operations Committee (CJOC) comprising the police inspector general, army and air force commanders, Zambia National Service commander and director of the intelligence unit under the ministry of defence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlovu, who later admitted that CJOC exists, sought the protection of the DPP not to allow him reveal secret operations in court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sikota also asked Ndhlovu to immediately resign as Zambia's Inspector- General of Police for committing a crime during the investigations on the Black Mamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police chief admitted that he committed a crime by issuing instructions that the telephone lines of the private 'Post' newspaper be tapped, contrary to existing laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only the Zambia Intelligence Service and Drug Enforcement Commission were supposed to bug telephones under the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlovu was later advised by the judge to remain silent if he did not wish to incriminate himself, after he was cross-examined for almost seven hours on Wednesday and Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The police boss ducked prying questions, saying he merely issues orders and directives, and so was not fully aware of the scenario of the treason case.  The trial continues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - The new commander of Ecomog, the ECOWAS peace keeping force in Liberia, has said the deployment of soldiers to trouble spots will be his top priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Maj. Gen. Victor Malu, however, warned that the success of the mission would depend on the cooperation of the warring factions and the fulfillment of the pledge by leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to raise more troops.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope by the time I get to Monrovia to consolidate earlier gains made by my predecessors, the additional troops we are expecting would have started arriving to aid our peace keeping operation,&quot; Malu told journalists Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the recent summit of ECOWAS Committee of Nine on Liberia, in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, it was agreed to increase ECOMOG's strength from the current 8,500 to around 18,000 troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Malu said the deployment of ECOMOG troops would stem incessant clashes between the warring factions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He takes over command from another Nigerian, Maj. Gen. John Mark Inienger, who headed ECOMOG for the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ECOMOG was sent to Monrovia in August 1990 to try and stop the civil war in Africa's oldest republic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war, started in 1989 as a rebellion by Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia, has killed at least 150,000 people, defying costly peace initiatives by ECOWAS and the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the Abuja summit, the Liberian warring factions signed a revised peace plan, beginning with a cease-fire last Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This is to be followed by deployment of ECOMOG troops to safe havens, disarmament of Liberia's estimated 60,000 combatants, and then national election in May 1997.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Former President F.W. de Klerk has apologized publicly for the misery of the apartheid era in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Delivering his National Party's submission to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Cape Town Wednesday, de Klerk admitted that apartheid had caused what he described as &quot;immeasurable pain and suffering to many.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He accepted responsibility and apologized for the unacceptable things which occurred during his rule. He also claimed that certain elements in the security forces had used unauthorized actions in an attempt to derail the South African transformation from apartheid to democracy while he was president.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while he accepted responsibility for human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era under his presidency, he was adamant that his government had never sanctioned assassination, murder, rape or assault.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk said that the apartheid government -- in an effort to fight the perceived communist threat posed by the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party -- had instituted a national management system to co-ordinate its response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Resultant far-reaching security legislation and the national state of emergency, he added, created circumstances conducive to many abuses and transgressions against human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There was a perceived need for unconventional counter-strategies, said de Klerk, but he had never been part of any decision by cabinet, the state security council or any other committee authorizing gross violation of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted, however, that he had authorized cross-border raids aimed at legitimate military targets which specifically excluded civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former state president expressed his deepest sympathy with those who suffered during the conflict and reiterated his apologies for the pain and suffering caused by the former policies of the National Party when it was in power in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a 23-member delegation -- led by deputy president Thabo Mbeki -- will make the African National Congress submission to the Human Rights Commission Thursday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenya recorded a 20-percent decline in international tourist arrivals in 1995, amounting to a drop of over 150,000 tourists, the minister for tourism nd wildlife, Noah Katana Ngala, has said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the drop was as a result of the weakening of most of the world's industrialized economies and general poor performance in international tourism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The slowed growth rate translated to a 20-percent decline in international arrivals falling by 150,000 tourists,&quot; Ngala said here Wednesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He, however, said that Kenya was not the only country whose tourist industry declined in 1995, observing that growth of international tourism was short of expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngala, who was launching a book on the 50th anniversary of the Intercontinental Hotel and Resorts, said tourists arrival worldwide totalled 561 million in 1995, reflecting a growth rate of 2.8 percent compared with 5.  5 percent growth rate in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said tourism will continue to be a major generator of foreign exchange for most countries and appealed to Kenyan hotels to recognize the tight competition they will be expected to face.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plane left Bordeaux, France, Wednesday and stops over in Nairobi before landing in Bujumbura Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 25 tons of drugs on board the plane will supply health centers and hospitals in Kirundo, Makamba, Gitega and Gankuzo, as well as one of the Bujumbura hospitals, for three months, the statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Because of the embargo which has been imposed on Burundi for a week now, certain drugs are becoming hard to find, especially anti-malaria drugs, while the disease is endemic in the region.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Currently, following the meeting of foreign ministers from the countries which imposed the embargo AuGust 16 in Kampala, only food aid for refugees and drugs are allowed through the borders by Burundi's neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, senior political leaders from Burundi have called for international sanctions to force new military strongman, Maj Pierre Buyoya, to give up power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking at a press conference in New York Wednesday after meeting with the UN Security Council, the leaders said the sanctions were necessary to put pressure on the new administration, which came to power through a military coup on July 25.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders, from the two political parties represented in the country's parliament -- FRODEBU and UPRONA -- said that such an action by the international community would reinforce the efforts of the countries in the sub-region, which have already announced sanctions against Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If the coup was allowed to stand, it would harm the interest of the countries around the world,&quot; said Jean Minani, president of FRODEBU and a former minister of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, &quot;it (the coup) would open the door for all those eager to take power through their weapons. This should not be tolerated in Burundi or anywhere else.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another FRODEBU official, Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, said the coup, which toppled president Sylvestre Ntibantungaya's government, should be condemned by everybody.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The embargo set on Burundi must be tougher and be implemented by the rest of the world until Buyoya gives up power,&quot; said Ngendahayo, a former foreign minister. &quot;That's why we are here, to tell it to the world, especially the Security Council. That's what we are going to do in the U.S. and Europe and the rest of the world.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, not all the four leaders at the conference, organized by the New York-based Parliamentarians for Global Action -- an association of elected legislators from 96 countries -- agreed on the need for stronger sanctions against the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Adrien Sibomana, an UPRONA member, who was a prime minister under Buyoya, said that he was concerned at the effect that sanctions would have on Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Burundi is a landlocked and poor country,&quot; he said, noting that international sanctions would hurt the people, especially children who might not have access to disease-preventing vaccinations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am not convinced sanctions are the best way to go,&quot; Sibomana added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The leaders all called on the international community to help initiate a process of political reconciliation in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They asked that the report of the commission of inquiry into the 1993 failed coup, in which the country's first democratically-elected President (Melchior Ndadaye) was killed, be published.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe that all those responsible for the series of killings and violence ought to be brought together irrespective of their party affiliations,&quot; said Anatole Kanyenkiko of UPRONA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kanyenkiko, also a former prime minister, said the international community had a role to play in terms of ensuring justice, adding: &quot;We want the report of the commission to be made public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The July 25 coup is the culmination of the violence which has racked Burundi since the 1993 coup attempt. An estimated 150,000 people have been killed in the violence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland - South Africa has decided to take punitive measures against Swaziland in their ongoing controversy over cheap Swazi sugar exports to the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Relations between the two countries have soured following complaints that cheaper Swazi sugar presented unfair competition to the South African sugar industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland Sugar Association general manager, Andy Colhoun, told PANA Thursday, that Swaziland had explained its case to South Africa, justifying the sugar exports which help redress a considerable imbalance of total trade between the two countries in favour of South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in spite of that, the South African Sugar Association had decided to take punitive measures against Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colhoun said the South Africans have decided to withhold certain important services and facilities in the country used by the Swaziland Sugar Association for which it has been paying 3.5 million rand a year (about 800, 000 U.S.dollars).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The facilities to be withdrawn when the contracts between the two associations expire March 31, 1997 are the use of the South African Sugar Association facilities for exporting sugar via Durban harbour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to the South African Sugar Association experimental station at Mount Edgecombe is to be withdrawn, thus denying Swaziland new varieties and other agronomic services from that station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Access to the facilities of the Sugar Milling Research Institute used for various analysis and other essential services essential to the running of an efficient sugar milling industry is also to be withdrawn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition, Swaziland will be denied access from November to the Mount Edgecombe Training Center where up to one third of the students trained come from Swaziland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colhoun said the Swaziland sugar industry could be damaged by these actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland's sugar industry has port facilities at Maputo, Mozambique, where the terminal is being upgraded and expanded and has offered the South African Sugar Association the use of the Maputo facilities when appropriate, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland is currently urgently looking for suitable alternatives in Mauritius, Zimbabwe and Australia to replace the facilities and services to be withdraw by the South African Sugar Association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colhoun said the Swaziland sugar industry was equally concerned about misinformation and misconceptions about the industry resulting from recent South Africa press reports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the reports stated Swaziland King Mswati owned over 50 percent of the country's sugar industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the true facts are that Tibiyo, the Swazi nation trust organization, owns 51 percent of Swaziland's sugar milling industry and 34 percent of the sugar growing industry which includes hundreds of small Swazi growers. The two industries are separate entities of which the king personally owns no part.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Colhoun said he understood top level discussions between the two associations were continuing in South Africa in an effort to resolve the dispute concerning Swaziland's sugar export.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Uncertainty surrounds negotiations scheduled to have started Thursday between the Zimbabwe government and civil servants to resolve a salary dispute which has paralysed government services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The uncertainty comes in the wake of the decision by civil servants to spurn an order by their representative body to return to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A major pre-condition for the negotiations set by the government Wednesday was that the striking employees return to work by Thursday morning.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil servants body, Public Service Association (PSA), Wednesday, ordered its members to return to work while it negotiates workers' grievances with the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But by early Thursday morning, government workers could be seen milling around the public service, labor and social welfare ministry head offices and the Africa Unity Square, as they persisted with their work boycott.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harare, the capital, the workers were addressed by some executive members of the PSA who castigated their colleagues who called off the strike Wednesday evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;You cannot be a leader if you dictate, the PSA should have consulted the workers if they agreed with the government's offer,&quot; said an irate worker from the ministry of higher education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The strike action, which has forced the closure of most offices throughout the country and suspension of some service, has generally crippled the provision of essential service over which the government has a monopoly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The business sector has moaned the absence of tax, immigration, industry and commerce and finance officers, saying the strike should be resolved to save investor confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civil servants are demanding 60 percent while the government in July awarded them increases of about 9 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public health workers who initiated the strike were Thursday adamant they would not relent until the government made a firm undertaking to review upward the increases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their job action has adversely affected the delivery of health services, with patients being attended to by army and Red Cross volunteers, who are evidently unable to cope.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigerian head of state Gen. Sani Abacha Wednesday administered the oath of office on military administrators (governors) for the nation's 30 states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Twenty-seven of them are new faces while three old ones were redeployed following a surprise reshuffle announced last week, the first change of the state chief executives since Abacha seized power in November 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He told the young military officers in Abuja, the federal capital, they should be servants and not bosses over the people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new thinking is that &quot;government is no more to be seen as a power above the people,&quot; but a veritable instrument for national development, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government exists for the people and you must, therefore, go to the states as servants of the people. Since you do not have a fixed tenure, your daily undertakings must be guided by decorum, dedication, discipline, honesty and above all, patriotism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The administrators are barred from obtaining foreign loans, and are to ensure continuity of programmes initiated by their predecessors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Abacha also charged them to maintain the &quot;momentum&quot; of his administration's transition to democracy programme, planned to end in October 1998, with the inauguration of elected civilian government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are to exhibit absolute neutrality and fairness in which their &quot;role must be transparently seen as that of an impartial umpire.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian leader avoided any reference to suggestions in the local press, since the change was announced, that some of the old military administrators could face trial for alleged mismanagement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the reports, the defence spokesman, Brig. Gen. Fred Chijuka, said he could not confirm or deny that such trials would take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is the prerogative of the presidency,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">No official explanation was given for the change of the military administrators, whose tenure of some 32 months was considered long, going by past experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speculation is also rife that a cabinet reshuffle is likely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But with silence and surprise as his greatest weapons, Abacha has managed to keep his trump cards close to his chest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The newly formed National Lima Party (NLP) yesterday added its voice to the call for political dialogue over the holding of the forthcoming presidential and general elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NLP co-chairman Guy Scott, in a press statement released in Lusaka yesterday, said his party's call for dialogue arises from economic concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrary to the impression given by the government media, even the World Bank has turned off the aid taps and this country is very tightly strapped for cash,&quot; Scott said, claiming: &quot;A World Bank representative told President Chiluba on Thursday last week that the Bank could not release finance unless there was some prospect of the bilateral donors coming back into the picture after elections.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And the only way, according to Scott, of ensuring that the donors come back &quot; is to conduct a dialogue that will result in some consensus over presidential qualifications, the voters roll, and other controversial matters&quot; .</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;At the moment it is the farmers who are bearing most of the financial strain,&quot; the Lima Party co-chairman complained, adding: &quot;There is no money out there for maize buying, and there is no money for inputs for the forthcoming season.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott advised that &quot;it is far better for the government to start a constructive process of dialogue than to remain silent and hope that something will turn up&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No miracle is going to take place,&quot; Scott warned. &quot; Only our own common sense will save us from misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a State House source was on Monday quoted by the state owned and government controlled Times of Zambia saying &quot;the President has always been ready for dialogue&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott calls for talks and &quot;it has always been the opposition who have torpedoed efforts for dialogue&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The State House spokesman was responding to accusations by the Zambia Democratic Congress that President Frederick Chiluba has closed all doors to dialogue with the opposition or the church - creating frustration and tension in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NLP also demanded that rural dwellers who have not yet collected their voters cards should be given a chance to do so by extending the period of the collection exercise which the Elections Office says will only run up to September 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott, who co-chairs NLP with Zambia National Farmers Union president Ben Kapita, complained that &quot;the publicity surrounding the collection of cards has been very poor, especially out on the farms&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We feel government should take the exceptional measure of allocating more time for card collection,&quot; Scott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott said &quot;right now, only some 20 per cent of those eligible can vote&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would appear that only half the eligible voters in areas such as Southern Province registered to vote in the first place,&quot; Scott carped. &quot; Subsequently it appears that fewer than half of these have actually collected their cards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And urging Ndola ruling MMD cadres to collect their cards in readiness for the &quot;war&quot;, President Frederick Chiluba on Wednesday said the collection voters cards will continue but not indefinitely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott also urged farmers to give their workers time to collect cards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While many commercial farmers have actively promoted the registration exercise, others have been unhelpful,&quot; Scott said. &quot;One case has been reported to me of a farmer refusing his workers permission to collect cards - on pain of dismissal. This is outrageous.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scott and Kapita yesterday called on the government to immediately release the K10 billion budgeted for the Food Reserve Agency in order to &quot;restore some semblance of health&quot; to the depressed maize market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They pointed out that maize was selling in villages at K7,000 per 90 kg bag - considerably less than the production cost of over K10,000.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailundo - The following are reports from Unita on the party congress taking place in central Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">23/08/96: The three commissions set up within the framework of the III Extra-ordinary Congress of UNITA, currently taking place in Bailundo since August 20, begun sitting today.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues related to the general policy of the Party, diplomacy and information are being debated within the Political Commission, while the Social and Economic Commission is discussing issues concerning the socio- economic life of the Party. Military issues are being debated in the Military Commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime, journalists and other invited guests visited the Londuimbali quartering area in order to see the real situation in the area described by most observers as dramatic as far as the conditions in which UNITA soldiers and their families are living is concerned. It is worth noting that conditions in the quartering areas are among topics being debated in the Military Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">20/08/96: Representatives of Angolan political parties are in Bailundo to attend the UNITA Congress which got underway on August 20, 1996. Ngola Kabango of the FNLA, Andre Milton Kilandamoko of the PSD, Malungo Belo of PDP- ANA and Emanuel Kunzika of the CNDA arrived this morning, aboard a Government plane, accompanied by a group of nine foreign and local journalists based in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Malungo Belo, their visit is intended to transmit their fraternal solidarity and good wishes for the success &quot;of this most important event.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the resolutions arising from the III Extra-ordinary Congress of UNITA will be decisive and give new life to UNITA and the country as a whole. He is the bearer of a verbal message from his party President for the UNITA President and a written message for UNITA congress delegates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ngola Kabango, who first visited Bailundo in 1975 as a member of the Transitional Government, expressed hope that the peace process does not derail and that it should involve all political parties in the country.  Invited guests from Italy, Germany, Ivory Coast, Burkina Fasso and Zaire as well as more than 30 journalists from various news organisations around the world are already in Bailundo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The entire town of Bailundo is covered with UNITA flags and photographs of the UNITA President and is proving to be too small to receive so many people anxious to accompany the UNITA Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">19/08/96: Portuguese political parties are present at UNITA's Extra- ordinary Congress. The Portuguese President, Dr Jorge Sampaio, is being represented by Laurentino Dias of the Socialist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon arrival in Bailundo, Laurentino Dias said that Portugal is committed to the Angolan peace process and will continue to render its support to the process through its participation on the Joint Commission and any other possible way. According to him, the Portuguese people hope that Angolans will be able to find lasting peace national reconciliation. &quot;Portugal maintains relations of trust and mutual respect with Angolan political parties,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Portuguese deputy, only through dialogue among all Angolans will it be possible to securely build a better country with solidarity. Laurentino Dias noted that the themes of the III Extra-ordinary Congress of UNITA reflects the Angolan political reality and corresponds to the expectations of all those who wish a prosperous future for Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Portuguese delegation to the III Extra-ordinary Congress of UNITA includes, among others, Commander Antonio Homem de Gouveia, former adviser to President Mario Soares and representatives from the PSD, CDS/PP (Portuguese political parties).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - The end of apartheid in South Africa may have removed the greatest destabilizing factor in Southern Africa, but other factors have come into focus with a potential to create instability in some of the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Authorities and non-governmental organizations in the region, cognizant of the lurking dangers, have gone on a peace offensive developing structures and building a capacity for peaceful resolution of disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Like the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) which has set up a mechanism for conflict prevention, resolution and management amid increasing marginalization of the continent in the post-cold war era, Southern Africa has taken the initiative in securing its own peace within the context of the OAU and UN charters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Southern African Development Community (SADC) Organ on Politics, Defence and Security, launched in Gaborone, Bostwana, in July, is the crystallization of the various efforts that authorities in the region have been making to contain potentially explosive situations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, South Africa's liberation, while eliminating the major source of instability, has exposed hitherto unseen or new factors in the politics of Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts see these developments as having a potential to create instability in some of the countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These factors range from arms smuggling from Mozambique into the volatile Kwazulu-Natal province of South Africa and the border dispute between Botswana and Namibia over a small island on the Chobe river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A potential right wing alliance involving the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and other opposition parties in South Africa as well as the anti-democratic monarchies in Lesotho and Swaziland ranged against the ruling African National Congress (ANC) are also seen as possible causes of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such an alignment would complicate the situation in Kwazulu-Natal, where over 14,000 people have died in the past 10 years in a low-intensity civil war between the ANC and the IFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allegations of ANC involvement in the recent pro-democracy strikes and demonstrations, that paralysed Swaziland and forced King Mswati III to accede to democratic reforms, illustrate the new political land-scape in the post- apartheid era and its attendant dangers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fragility of peace in the region is also shown by the nervousness of the Namibian government over the recent arms purchases by Botswana and the war games that the Botswana army staged on the border with Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reality facing Southern Africa is that the structural and predisposing factors for violence and instability will endure for a long time,&quot; says Jakkie Cilliers, executive director of the Pretoria-based Institute for Defence Policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Therefore, the creation of peace structures and preventive diplomacy mechanisms is a welcome development for SADC member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chaired by Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe along with South Africa's President Nelson Mandela and Botswana's President Ketumile Masire, the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security inherited the structures of the frontline states and the troika of the same leaders who in 1995 helped reverse the royal coup in Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The new culture of peacekeeping and preventive diplomacy in Southern Africa is synergetic to the re-awakening in Africa about the need for the continent to take the lead in seeking solutions to its many internal conflicts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Africans themselves must first and foremost be seen to clean up their mess while the international community must continue to provide the logistics,&quot; says Chris Bakwesegha, who heads the OAU's division on conflict prevention, management and resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the Africans insist that the UN should never abdicate its peacekeeping responsibilities in the region because African countries are also members of the world body, the reality on the ground shows that after the Somalia debacle and the tragedy in Rwanda, Africa is being increasingly marginalized by the cash-strapped UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UN peacekeeping budget has risen astronomically in the past five years to 3.6 billion U.S. dollars, a figure considered unsustainable given the state of finances of the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The trend is that unless one of the permanent members of the Security Council has an interest in a particular region, the UN is unlikely to be moved into undertaking an expensive peacekeeping operation,&quot; says Age Eknes of the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Bakwesegha and Eknes spoke at the recent &quot;training for peace&quot; workshop at Kadoma 140 km (87.5 miles) south-west of Harare, attended by military and foreign affairs officers and representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The workshop was organized by the Durban-based African Center for Constructive Resolution of Disputes and the Institute of Defence Policy. It was funded by the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs, an NGO to develop capacity for peaceful resolution of disputes as well as peacekeeping in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The long-term objective of the NGO &quot;contribute to regional confidence building and lay the foundations for mutual understanding and respect across cultural and geographical divides&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hopefully, through such concerted local efforts, the tensions on the Chobe river or the carnage in Kwazulu-Natal will be eliminated leaving the region to concentrate on the task of economic development.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia -- At least two million Zambian children under-five years old are expected to be immunized against polio during the country's second national vaccination campaign which started Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian health officials running the campaign said they hoped to immunize between 2.3 and three million children during the two-day effort.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the first phase, in July, close to two million children were vaccinated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials estimated they needed to vaccinate just 1.6 million children but the figure has been revised by the National Statistics Office and health officials who say they had under-estimated the target child population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The vaccination campaign is part of the World Health Organisation's global efforts to eradicate the debilitating disease by the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statistics provided by the Virology Laboratory in Lusaka shows a recurrence of the disease since 1992, when four cases were recorded. The figure doubled in 1993, and in 1995 45 cases were officially documented. There are six confirmed polio cases reported, so far, this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Polio, which normally causes paralysis of the limbs, is caused by what is medically termed the &quot;wild polio virus.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambian medical authorities say there are 99 other people infected with the polio virus for every person with the paralytic symptoms of the disease.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ACCRA, Ghana - Ghana has assured the international community of the determination of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to see durable peace return to Liberia and called for support to the peace plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;ECOWAS is determined this time around to effect the return of permanent and durable peace to Liberia, &quot; Mohamed Ibn Chambas, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and member of the Liberian Mediation team, told diplomats in Accra on Thursday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambas, who was briefing the Diplomatic Corps on the just-ended ECOWAS Committee of Nine (C9) meeting on Liberia held in Abuja, appealed to the ambassadors to increase pressure on their governments to aid ECOWAS to keep the Abuja Agreement on track.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A communique issued at the end of the C9 meeting reaffirmed and extended the Abuja Agreement for nine more months as the best framework for finding lasting peace in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting also spelt out a new schedule of implementation of the agreement for the return of democratic rule to the war-torn country next June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provision of adequate logistics for the West African Peace- keeping Force (ECOMOG) in addition to strengthening its capacity, form part of the crucial hurdle in the implementation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Apart from manpower requirements, about 132 million dollars is needed to make ECOMOG efficient and effective in its task of disarmament and demobilization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambas said ECOMOG needs 18,000 troops in order to safeguard the peace process, adding that arrangements have been completed for additional contributions from member countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Ghana would contribute one more battalion of 850 men, while Niger, Burkina Faso, The Gambia and Cote d'Ivoire add troops ranging between a battalion and a company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The level of troops from Benin and Togo would be determined in due course, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambas said one major achievement of the Abuja meeting was the reconciliation of the members of the Liberian Council of State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Council of state, he said, held an official meeting in Abuja and deliberated on the General Roosevelt Johnson issue, agreeing to reinstate him as a minister in the transitional government, as stipulated in the Accra Mechanism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johnson, on the other hand, said he was determined to work with the Council and would return guns his forces seized from ECOMOG last December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chambas quoted news reports indicating that a cease-fire declared in Liberia was generally holding, while Johnson's ULIMO-J has returned the guns his troops captured from ECOMOG to the peacekeepers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These news reports confirm that the Liberian peace process has been energized and is being brought back on track,&quot; Chambas told the briefing, also attended by members of the Liberia Mediation team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials hinted that Johnson was expected to leave for Monrovia, making a brief stop-over in Accra. They could, however, not tell when and how the faction leader who was at the center of bitter fighting last April, would reach home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We (have) left him in Abuja...he is expected to go to Monrovia. He may come over briefly to Accra before proceeding to Monrovia,&quot; Kwame Amoa-Awua, head of the Africa Bureau of the ministry of foreign affairs, told the Ghana News Agency (GNA).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - The Zambian government is to set up an inter-ministerial committee to monitor and coordinate implementation of the economic sanctions imposed on the Burundi military regime of Maj. Pierre Buyoya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia's deputy foreign affairs minister, Peter Machungwa, said Friday in a statement in Lusaka, that the country acknowledged that strict implementation of the sanctions by all concerned was bound to force the Buyoya regime to quickly restore democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia last week severed all contacts with Burundi, including water, land and air communication in protest against Buyoya's July 25 coup that removed the elected government of President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions followed similar ones by the Great Lakes and other African states which want Burundi to be returned to legality and constitutional order by reinstating that country's parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The embargo is also intended to put pressure on the Buyoya regime to unban all political parties and initiate immediate unconditional negotiations with all concerned parties to restore stability and peace to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Machungwa said government will impound all vessels and goods on Lake Tanganyika intended to bust the sanctions. Lake Tanganyika is Zambia's major trade link with Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Kampala last week, a ministerial meeting of the Great Lakes states and others participating in the sanctions agreed to impose a travel ban on members of the Buyoya regime within the region, in addition to the sanctions.  They, however, recommended to exempt medicines and emergency food from the trade ban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers had co-opted the office of United Nations Higher Commissioner for Refugees to ensure that only human medicines and food entered that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In order to effectively monitor the sanctions, the ministers established the regional sanctions coordination committee to be based in Nairobi and chaired by Tanzania.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Its functions will include harmonizing, monitoring and coordinating the activities of national sanctions committees, similar to the one being set up in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Work done by Nikuv Computers (Israel) Limited on Zambia's voters roll has impressed President Frederick Chiluba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touring Nikuv Computers' facilities at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre yesterday President Chiluba said he could not understand why some politicians were critical of the company's work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am satisfied with your work and I cannot understand those politicians who continue to criticise the work of Nikuv,&quot; said President Chiluba, naming Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika as one such critic.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba further challenged opposition politicians to visit the centre before making what he termed baseless attacks on the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I cannot understand how someone can say this card fades within a day.  Lewanika said this on television but this card is of high quality. It is designed for three presidential elections and it can last 15 years. It is better than the paper we had in 1991,&quot; President Chiluba said. &quot;I appeal to my colleagues and friends to visit you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nikuv Computers programme manager, Gershon Korda, told the President his company, which has tested the card, was guaranteeing its quality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We guarantee the quality,&quot; Korda told the President. &quot;Unfortunately none of the opposition leaders have visited us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Korda also assured Zambians that voters whose names have been misplaced in the provisional register would be included in the final roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are waiting for the inspection period to finish we will correct all the mistakes,&quot; Korda assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National Party secretary general, Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika, in an interview on Wednesday, charged that the whole administration of the voters registration exercise was bad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;An honest government would admit that the whole thing is a mess and does not give the sort of confidence that is required,&quot; Lewanika said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Lewanika maintained his earlier position that the quality of the voters cards was poor as the data was already erasing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lewanika was reacting to President Frederick Chiluba's claims in Ndola on Tuesday that the cards were of &quot;high quality&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Contrary to President Chiluba's assertions who has had his card for only two days, I have had mine for two weeks and seen that it rubs off and I will be handing it over to the electoral Commission as material proof,&quot; Lewanika said, displaying his partially erased card, advising:&quot;When one makes a mistake of low quality and maladministration they should not seek to cover up through lies. They should come up with corrective action when these are brought to their attention.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia has stabilised in that the economy had grown by about five to six per cent, said Bank of Zambia director of economics department, Felix Kani in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kani, speaking at the ongoing International Banking Conference being held at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre, however, acknowledged that the Zambian economy had suffered some &quot;shocks&quot; in the mining sector over the low production and prices as well as the closure of some banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kani revealed that the major challenge experienced by the Bank of Zambia last year had been to maintain economic stability &quot;with three banks in receivership and one in liquidation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kani advised that there was need for the Bank of Zambia to have a tight supervisory capacity over the country's financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most important is the flow of information in a market economy,&quot; Kani said.  &quot;Inadequate information leads to speculation from businessmen which can upset the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Professor Lawrence Harris from the University of London, while recognising the progress made in the Zambian banking sector, noted that the country was still living with the effects of the liquidity injection which had characterised government's desperate efforts to rescue Meridien BIAO Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 47 per cent increase in money supply is not benign and must be watched closely if the economic reform programme is to be kept on track,&quot; Professor Harris said, noting that the increase in money supply might be an indicator of spiralling inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Harris also urged the independence of the central bank as a factor in lowering the rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Prime Minister Meles Zenawi assured the nation here yesterday that the goal of attaining self-sufficiency in food, originally scheduled for between five and seven years, will definitely be reached by the next Ethiopian year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a press conference attended by local journalists, Ato Meles indicated that the country may even find it necessary to export some of its food grains since prices are expected to fall sharply because of the surplus. &quot;Some had even speculated that food self-sufficiency would be attained during the year just ended but I was personally of the view that the 1989 E.C. harvest season was a safer bet,&quot; the Prime Minister pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He at the same time dismissed as mendacious allegations that the reported 7.  7 percent growth in the economy was cosmetic, saying: &quot;The consumer public knows very well that there has lately been a near dramatic fall in the price of food grains; peasant farmers in much of the country have experienced substantial improvement in their livelihood: Coffee producers have even began introducing electronics equipment into their homes and offices.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The growth in the economy should not be assessed by rises in GDP only, according to Ato Meles. &quot;Of equal significance is the overall stabilization of the economy, the substantial reduction in budget deficit as well as the notable success attained in bringing down the inflation rate to a mere 0.9 percent,&quot; he told the heavily attended press briefing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked of his view of why organized terrorism has as of recently targeted this country, Prime Minister Meles made it clear that Ethiopia is by no means alone in getting exposed to the menace which he described as &quot;International.&quot; &quot;The ideology of terrorism is the ideology of frustration,&quot; he stated, adding: &quot;Those engaged in it whether here or anywhere else do so when emerging trends are not in their favour and thwart the fulfilment of their aspirations.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He nevertheless felt that multinational terrorists had turned their attention to this country on account of two reasons in particular: The government's unflinching stand against organized terror following the abortive attempt on the life of Egyptian President Hosini Mubarak last year and the openly declared intention of certain hostile forces to stop and if possible reverse the peaceful and democratic process upon which the country has embarked. Ato Meles stressed nonetheless that military action alone is not enough in countering such conspiracy, adding that public vigilance and the readiness to defend the gains made in all areas of national endeavour were even more important.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if the recent cross-border military counter-offensive was not a violation of Somalia's sovereignty, the Prime Minister said, &quot;definitely not!.  He recalled that the government had remained patient throughout much of last year when terrorists kept violating Ethiopian territory. He described the Federal government's choice not to retaliate in kind entirely on moral grounds since I having done so would have added to the suffering of the trouble-torn people of Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We met no hostile response from the international community because the situation could no longer be tolerated and our action was 100% correct from the legal point of view,&quot; Ato meles pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his exhaustive and detailed briefing, the Prime Minister touched on a whole range of issues socio-economic and political and the Herald informs its readers that these will be covered in depth in tomorrow's issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister Meles Zenawi was asked whether the multinational terrorist conspiracy was in any way connected with the present and future use of the Blue Nile, but said he hoped not. &quot;It should not in any way be related to that since the accord reached between the signatory countries very specifically asserts Ethiopia's national interests in a way that is not detrimental to those of the other parties,&quot; Ato meles noted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the means of dealing with such a problem, the Prime Minister said that his government's ultimate goal is to get at the very source of the menace. He, however, stated that plans for defending possible future targets of organized banditry are already in place. Ato Meles didn't underestimate the difficulty of entirely controlling terrorism, nonetheless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The ultimate plan in thwarting the threat lies in exploiting the age-old Ethiopian tradition of denying refuge to criminals,&quot; the Prime Minister hinted, but warned that resort to terrorism is not connected with any particular community or religious group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So far as counter-offensive actions are concerned, Ato meles vowed that the government will directly or indirectly hunt down the criminals right down to their lair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking of capacity building, which is a top the agenda of the government's five-year development strategy, Ato Meles stated that a lot has been done to raise the efficiency of the executive branch, particularly in the regional states. He said that in addition to intensive training programmes organized by the Civil service College, legal practitioners and woreda administrators have been offered short term courses. &quot;The result proved encouraging from the outset,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Meles disclosed the opening of new education faculties at Dilla, Alamaya and Bahir Dar, and engineering faculties at Bahir Dar and Makalle as well as health institutions in Dilla and other localities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These will all begin operation as of the next academic year, according to the Prime Minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Meles said that the Federal Government has been and remains committed to extending technical assistance to the various state governments, with priority to those lacking adequate skilled manpower. This, he said, was entirely inresponse to their request. &quot;To bring about an equitable development in all regional states,&quot; says Ato Meles, &quot;the Federal Government builds basic infrastructures in all, but cannot interfere in their internal affairs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked about his government's reported &quot;special relationship&quot; with the People's Republic of China, the Prime Minister said: &quot; We don't have any special relationship with any country. We have good relations with virtually all nations across the world and pursue a foreign policy which best serves Ethiopia's national interest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Meles saw no positive trend in Ethio-Sudan relationship. &quot;We can't have good relations with Sudan until the government there gives us solid guarantee against terrorist incursions and extradites known criminals,&quot; he said with feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister admitted that keeping under detention those implicated in the Derg's Red Terror for over five years without charges is no longer justifiable and pledged a swift measure. He nonetheless dismissed as mendacious allegations about clandestine arrest and imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he lived up to his promise of &quot;welcoming loyal opposition half-way, : Ato Meles said that none of them bothered to take any such step. He also said that he saw no improvement around the private press in particular but that he still remained hopeful of a positive response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking on ways of controlling corruption, Ato Meles said that the immediate strategy lies in &quot;hunting down the corrupt.&quot; But the ultimate solution is to be found in creating a working atmosphere that would let no loophole for all such practices. The Prime Minister cited the outright dismissal of customs police as a case in point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked to justify his original plans to send a peace keeping force to Burundi &quot;when there are closer and relatively better-off nations,&quot; Ato Meles said that it's foolish to consider oneself safe when a sister nation is caught in total anarchy. &quot;Besides it is justified on moral grounds for we have endured a similar fratricidal war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the Prime Minister, the country couldn't attract the expected amount of foreign investment. This was partly because of policies that hampered such involvement and bureaucraticredtape and partly because &quot;some investors don't see a good climate unless they are allowed to indulge in activities that would negatively affect our national interest,&quot; Ato Meles stated. He foresaw better progress in future, all the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Asked if he wields a mechanism for ready access to first-hand information on what is going on in the country, Ato Meles said: &quot;I sometimes go to the rural areas to have my own observation on the agricultural front. I would have wished to do the same in many areas but cannot to do because of very tight working schedules.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Afterwards Mr Chiluba described the talks as having been held in a frank and very friendly atmosphere and disclosed for the first time that he was in the process of meeting United National Independence Party president, Dr Kenneth Kaunda, soon to further dialogue on the recent developments in Zambia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I spoke to Dr Kaunda last week but the meeting did not take place due to the SADC meeting in Maseru. But we will continue the process of dialogue with him and all other opposition party leaders, &quot; Mr Chiluba said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said before departure for Lusaka in Pretoria that he met Mr Mandela to explain further the constituitional changes in Zambia and to correct the wrong media reports that former president, Dr Kaunda, is being harrassed by the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The President said his meeting with Mr Mandela was held under very warm and cordial relations and that the South African leader has now been given extra information on the developments in Zambia which were explained wrongly because of the constitutional changes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr Chiluba and Mr Mandela have been planning to meet since November last year, to discuss other pressing issues, and they took this opportunity to also hold bilateral talks between their two states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The announced meeting between President Chiluba and Dr Kaunda will go a long way in easing tension between the ruling party and opposition UNIP which, together with other political parties and politically active Non- Governmental Organisations have been calling for this kind of dialogue without seemingly much success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time that President Chiluba attempted to meet opposition parties for dialogue in Lusaka was in April when the meeting floundered and ran aground after opposition leaders a defiant position over who should chair the meeting and they even went as far as refusing to acknowledge his presence when he entered the conference hall for delibertions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in Pretoria, Zambian government officials led by Movement for Multi- party Democracy Chairman for International Relations, Vernon Mwaanga, met South African government officials to explain the recent constitutional changes in Zambia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team included Lands Minister Luminzu Shimaponda, and Deputy Minister for special duties at State House, Eric Silwamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba returned home immediately after the talks with Mr Mandela.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Prospects of shortages of maize later this year were not unreal, Zambia National Farmers' Union (ZFNU) executive director, George Grey, warned at an International Banking Conference on Friday at the Mulungushi International Conference Centre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking during a panel discussion on the possibilities of economic growth, Grey also warned that Zambia is approaching a crisis in the agriculture industry due to lack of inputs for the next farming season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is not enough money coming from the credit schemes and we have to know that the government has not received its money from the schemes...The government is relying on the private sector to provide inputs for this coming season and the private sector's capacity is severely limited,&quot; Grey said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Agriculture minister Suresh Desai last week announced that the government had stopped funding the three major farmers' lending institutions - Lima Bank, Credit Union and Savings Association and Zambia Cooperative Finance Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Desai said the institutions would be expected to run like other business organisations without the aid of government grants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grey predicted that the credit squeeze would show farmers that they had to pay back whatever they borrowed to enable them borrow again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It will show them that they have to pay back because credit is not a right, &quot; Desai said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As for the reliance on the private sector to provide lending for inputs, Grey pointed out that already, commercial banks were not willing to lend to farmers given the government's tendency to manipulate prices like it has done twice before in the last six months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the shortage of maize, Grey said the 15.6 million bags harvest announced by the government was not correct because reality had proved that the national figures were less than 14 million bags of maize produced in the last season.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Grey said this was due to a number of factors including the non- availability of grain bags and government's inability to bring in the maize to the food reserves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I hope these lessons force us to diversify more. I believe we should only grow enough maize to feed ourselves,&quot; Grey said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Bank of Zambia economist, Danny Kalyalya, said the growth in the agricultural sector and the economy as a whole was likely to come from non- traditional exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zambia has benefited from increased exports in flowers and vegetables in the last three years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - The 12-member SADC edged a step closer towards becoming a free trade area following the signing of a trade protocol agreement on Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protocol, which provides the legal framework for the removal of tariffs and other measures restricting free trade in the region, was supported by the 12 states at the community's 16th summit in Maseru, Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The protocol shied away from details, but Alex Erwin, the South African Minister of Trade and Industry, says these will be worked out in the next six months.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many community member states, like Zambia, insist on speeding up the phasing out of tariffs, hoping it will open up South Africa's markets and address the huge trade imbalance within Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa favours a longer phasing out period, but some community members see this as South Africa's attempt to maintain the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The perception is that South Africa is a bully boy,&quot; says</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Erwin, &quot;but the fact is that the trade imbalance within the region is growing rapidly in our favour in spite of tariffs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If you remove these trade barriers faster, they will accelerate even further in our favour,&quot; he warns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His Zambian counterpart, Dr Syamukayumbu Sya-mujaye, says South Africa has to &quot;open up its markets to goods from other countries&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are losing out to South Africa because of our lower tariffs, while South Africa's tariffs remain high. It needs to move fast,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade protocol - which binds Zimbabwe, Zambia, Lesotho, Swaziland, Tanzania, Angola, Botswana and Namibia - comes at a time when the community's members are pressing South Africa to open up its markets to goods from the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier this month, South Africa and Zimbabwe resolved a four-year-long trade dispute, which will see tariffs on clothing and textiles from Zimbabwe lowered from over 70 percent to 20 percent by 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trade protocol signed on Friday also makes provision for existing arrangements, like the customs union and bilateral agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The heads of state at the summit also signed protocols on energy co- operation, transport, communication and combating illicit drug trafficking.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - So finally our government through foreign affairs minister Gen.  Christon Tembo has decided to review our relations with the military government in Burundi in support of other east and southern African countries that have decided to impose economic sanctions against the military government in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The question the Jury then turned and asked itself was, what about the concept of sovereignty, is Burundi not a sovereign state?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only a few months ago, our government cried foul when foreign states threatened them with sanctions over the adoption and contents of the unpopular Constitutional Amendments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our government cried that Zambia as a sovereign state had the right to freely choose and develop its political, social, economic and cultural systems and therefore foreigners had no business interfering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jury then advised that the concept of sovereignty was by and large a myth in that no state was an island. Every state has a duty to comply and in good faith with its international obligations and respect conventions and treaties it had freely entered into and signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zambian government was still adamant about its sovereignty and that is why the Jury was shocked that it took a stance against Burundi which boils down to sovereignty. The principle of the action is okay, but it is this question of double standards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The adoption and contents of the constitution was more or less popular among MMD and government leaders, a clear minority, equally the coup in Burundi is popular among the minority soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the MMD government respects the principle that each state has the right freely to choose and develop its political, social, economic and cultural systems, why then shouldn't the Burundi people decide their political destiny?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why shouldn't the soldiers rule if that is the wish of the people of Burundi, why should Zambia bother if Burundi people kill each other?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The answer is simply that, a military coup is an affront to democratic ideals and further that the interest of other nationals in Burundi is threatened if the Burundi people rise against the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Legally speaking, the Jury appreciates the stance taken against Burundi, obviously morally, innocent citizens will suffer. But the most important thing to note is that we should never use the concept of sovereignty to block foreign interference when we are infringing the rights of citizen.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Contrary to media reports today (22 August), UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, has no plans to suspend its operations in Burundi.  UNICEF has eight international and 74 national staff members in Burundi and UNICEF programmes are continuing in health, water and sanitation, education, nutrition, psycho-social recovery and family tracing.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF is concerned that children are already being affected by the sanctions recently imposed on the country, and that the situation will deteriorate unless steps are taken to ensure their special protection. There is particular concern at fuel shortages which are hampering cross-border reunification programmes for 20,000 unaccompanied children and may paralyze immunization activities. Burundi was on the verge of reaching 75% immunization of under one year-olds, or 190,000 children, but there are now no supplies of Polio or BCG vaccines in the country. Fuel shortages will also jeopardize the supplementary feeding programme which is currently reaching 30, 000 malnourished children who have been uprooted from their homes. UNICEF currently has only three to five days' supply of fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UNICEF, together with other UN-agencies and non-governmental organizations, is advocating for protected supply routes, or so-called 'humanitarian corridors', to allow the continued flow of food, fuel, vaccines, medical supplies and other items essential for the well-being of children.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Number 23 (19 - 25 August 1996) in a series of weekly reports from the UN DHA Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) on general developments in the Great Lakes region. Sources for the information below include UN agencies, NGOs, other international organisations and media reports. IRIN issues these reports for the benefit of the humanitarian community, but accepts no responsibility as to the accuracy of the original sources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Zaire and Rwanda agreed on Thursday to a speedy and total repatriation of the more than one million Rwandan refugees currently living in Kivu region of eastern Zaire. The announcement was made in a press conference organized by Zaire's Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo and Rwanda's Prime Minister Pierre- Celestin Rwigema. Kengo wa Dondo said the repatriation process would go ahead &quot;rapidly&quot; and would be &quot;massive, organised and unconditional&quot;. The aim would be to ensure the return of all Rwandan refugees to Rwanda before Zaire's electoral process gets underway in May 1997.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The full statement said that the Government of Zaire would begin &quot;the progressive closure of the camps and ensure the rapid repatriation of Rwandan refugees&quot; while the Rwandan Government would take measures to welcome and install them in Rwanda. The two Governments also agreed to organize visits to refugee camps and transit camps and to pursue operations &quot;to separate intimidators from innocent people&quot;. It was later reported that Zaire had expelled 28 Rwandans to Rwanda on Wednesday, accusing them of being intimidators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The UNHCR on Friday stated its opposition to any attempt to forcibly repatriate Rwandan refugees from Zaire. Fernando del Mundo, UNHCR's spokesman, said that UNHCR was &quot;not going to be part of any forced repatriation&quot; and that the agency had not been informed about the discussions between the two Governments. Mr del Mundo recalled that both Governments had committed themselves in the past to resolve the refugee issue on the basis of voluntary repatriation and not expulsions. &quot;These are our standards&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Some 6,000 Rwandan refugees returned to Rwanda from Burundi on Thursday, leaving Magara camp and crossing the border during the night. This left only 220 refugees remaining in the camp. UNHCR planned to distribute a five day food ration to these people on Friday and had no plans to transfer these people to Rukuramigabo camp. This brings to over 50,000 the number of Rwandan refugees who have returned to Rwanda from Burundi since the beginning of August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># By Sunday night there were only 10,720 Rwandan refugees remaining in Burundi, 10,500 of whom in Rukuramigabo camp. 2,100 refugees returned to Rwanda from Wednesday to Saturday. (UNHCR reports that up to 4,000 refugees left from Rukuramigabo on Monday, 26 August 1996.) As of Friday there were 17, 000 people living in the Butare transit camp. They are being transferred to their home communes on a daily basis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># More than 6,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the July 25 coup, according to Amnesty International. Amnesty said that it had learnt that at least 4,050 civilians were extrajudicially executed between July 27 and August 10 by Burundi Government forces in Giheta district of Gitega province.  &quot;We are disturbed that as many people have been massacred since the coup as were reported killed in the previous three months&quot;, Amnesty said. The Amnesty figures are similar to claims by FRODEBU, made on August 16, that the Army had massacred 5,000 Hutu civilians since the coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A spokesman for Burundi's leader Pierre Buyoya on Thursday denied the findings in the Amnesty report. According to Reuters, Jean-Luc Ndizeye said, &quot; Amnesty International is either completely misguided or is falling into a propaganda trap. I am positive that they are misinformed and that these numbers are outrageous&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># A WFP convoy of four trucks arrived in Ngozi from Tanzania on Sunday carrying relief food (rice and nutritional biscuits) and medicines. A cargo plane carrying 24 tonnes of drugs and medical materials from MSF France arrived in Bujumbura from Nairobi on Thursday afternoon. The French relief agency plans to use the drugs to supply dispensaries in several locations around the country and says that these will assist more than one million people over the next three months. The MSF-chartered flight represents the first relief supplies to reach Burundi by air since the embargo imposed by Regional Governments was put in place. Rebel groups, meanwhile, were reported to be trying to impose a blockade in Bujumbura by dissuading peasant farmers from providing food. Aid workers said on Thursday that they had been told of death threats against farmers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Burundi's regime reiterated its opposition to UN proposals for a multinational force in Burundi on Tuesday, following a statement in support of the proposal by Dr Boutros-Ghali on Monday. Jean-Luc Ndizeye, spokesman for Pierre Buyoya said, &quot;we are against the sending of foreign troops. We are not surprised by Boutros-Ghali's declaration but we are opposed to it.&quot; He added, &quot;This approach does not take into account the reality in Burundi. It is up to we Burundians to take our destiny in hand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The comments come in the wake of the UN Secretary-General's latest report to the Security Council, in which Dr Boutros-Ghali stated that &quot;the international community must allow for the possibility that the worst may happen and that genocide may occur in Burundi. In that case, whatever Governments may think now, military intervention to save lives might become an inescapable imperative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report acknowledged, however, that previous efforts to find countries willing to take the lead in mobilizing and organizing such a force had met with little response. Two proposals had been considered by UN Member States, a peace-keeping operation and a force for humanitarian intervention deployed under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Some 86 Member States had been approached regarding a contribution to the peacekeeping proposal, of which 20 had replied, 14 positively and 6 negatively. On the humanitarian intervention force proposal, nearly 50 countries were approached, of whom 21 replied, and 11 declined to participate. Of the 10 positive replies, only three member states offered troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Boutros-Ghali was critical of the coup d'etat of July 25, stating that &quot; the forceful overthrow of the legal Government will not solve the problems of Burundi. It will reinforce the fears of one side and strengthen extremists on both sides. It will increase violence and add to the suffering of the Burundian people. It thus makes political dialogue all the more imperative.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On sanctions, the report suggests that they &quot;should not be seen as an instrument of punishment, nor should they be allowed to add to the hardship of the suffering people of Burundi. They are, as always, a means to an end.  The end in this case is the opening of serious negotiations for a political settlement.&quot; Consultations on establishing humanitarian exemptions continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># UNICEF will suspend its operations in Burundi at the end of next week unless Regional Governments relax sanctions, according to a Reuters news report on Friday. The news agency quoted Michel Sidibe, UNICEF's Representative in Burundi, as saying that &quot;at the end of next week... UNICEF will stop working for lack of of fuel and as a result our entire immunisation programme for the year will be wiped out&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The UN Human Rights Field Office in Rwanda published a report on Thursday revealing that 365 people died in various armed incidents in Rwanda in July.  The report said that 226 of these were caused by &quot;agents of the state&quot; including the RPA, which killed 182 people in operations against Hutu insurgents. 'Interahamwe' guerillas killed 45 people, while the responsibility for the deaths of the remaining 94 persons could not be established. Some 220 of these deaths occured in Gisenyi prefecture. The report also showed that the authorities had released 866 detainees last month and had arrested 2,769. Rwanda's total prison population at the end of July was 78,510, of whom 52,678 were in prisons and the rest in makeshift detention centres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># Rebels from the Lord's Resistance Army abducted 89 young people in Uganda's Gulu district in two separate incidents last week. On Monday they took 39 students from a mixed secondary school in Gulu, while on Friday they abducted 50 young girls from three villages in the district. According to a report in the New Vision newspaper, the rebels had moved from village to village telling residents they wanted young girls to take back with them to their jungle bases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"># The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights will establish a UN Centre for Human Rights in Zaire in the near future. Two human rights experts will be based in Kinshasa with a brief to study developments in the country and advise officials there. The announcement follows an agreement signed in Geneva by Jose Ayala Lasso, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and N'Singa Udjuu, Zaire's Justice Minister.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - Zimbabwe's informal sector, previously neglected by planners, is poised to become the engine for the country's economic growth if current initiatives by the government, local authorities and the private sector are implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After 16 years of uncoordinated planning, the three parties agree that the current unemployment crisis, estimated at 40 percent of the labor force in a country of 10,5 million people, is a recipe for instability in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Intelligence analyses already indicate that unemployment remains the biggest threat to stability in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Indigenous pressure groups like the Affirmative Action Group (AAG) and the Indigenous Business Development Center have threatened disruptive action if the situation continues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our observation is that there is a lot of resistance to empower the informal sector so that they move away from being consumers to producers,&quot; says Caleb Chihota of AAG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) president, Danny Meyer agrees.  &quot;We have been talking and talking, holding workshops and seminars on the need to come up with job-creating projects but we have never done something about it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Experts now admit that reliance on foreign and multinational investment where work places cost in excess of 50 000 U.S. dollars each is no longer tenable and are experimenting with various projects aimed at developing the informal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a recent workshop in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city, representatives from the three sectors acknowledged the potential of the informal sector, which now employs 1,5 million people against the formal sector's two million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;No matter what local authorities do they cannot afford to ignore the informal sector anymore. It is one of the fastest growing and vibrant sectors and should be taken into consideration during planning,&quot; says Godfrey Nhemachena, Gweru's town clerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The formal sector has failed to create employment, leaving 300 000 new labor entrants every year with no prospects of jobs,&quot; observes Thenjiwe Lesabe, Zimbabwe's minister for national affairs, employment creation and co- operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The advent of the world bank and international monetary fund-sponsored reform programme in 1991 triggered massive retrenchments of over 30 000 employees, most of whom find solace in the informal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The activities, which are labor rather than capital intensive, include carpentry, furniture and clothing manufacturing, welding, metalwork and panel- beating. Others are spray-painting, shoe repairs, hairdressing, vending and retailing, carried out from backyard shops or on street corners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Though some of them are flourishing, representatives of the sector still complain of outdated licensing and zoning laws, health regulations, income tax and companies legislation which discourage their existence alongside the formal sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also, lack of capital and land means that no vibrant sector exists, at least for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is against this background that Zimbabwe's local authorities are changing city and town by-laws to accommodate the informal sector while the private sector has initiated a sub-contracting and linkages programme designed to spread the benefits of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bulawayo town clerk, Mike Ndubiwa, says in addition to business incubators, the local authority has allocated sites for the sector in line with the type of activity being engaged in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ZNCC micro-business development corporation plans to build three incubator workshop sites in Harare and one in Kwekwe worth one million dollars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sites which are expected to create 100 000 new jobs by the turn of the century are expected to spread to rural areas to stem the drift to urban area by unemployed youths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The entrepreneurs that may use these sites will be engaged in a wide variety of activities. After two years they will be expected to graduate into the formal sector and move out to make way for others,&quot; says Frank Jackson of the ZNCC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chamber of commerce also plans to provide business management training.  The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries sub-contracting and linkages programme is beginning to bear fruit for the small enterprises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Allen Dickie, director of the programme, says 35 large corporations and 50 small enterprises had already been registered since 1994. &quot;Over 50 activities have been identified for linkages, three are already operational and 12 still under negotiations. it has been a win-win situation for both parties resulting in improved efficiency, competition and creation of wealth.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Lesabe says apart from creating an enabling environment through affirmative legislation, government plans to establish incubators which also provide space, equipment and consultancy services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government has also started an employment creation fund in which entrepreneurs borrow up to 30 000 (Zimdollars) to be paid back at 12 percent interest to offset the high interests of over 30 percent charged by commercial banks,&quot; she says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With all these initiatives in the pipeline, experts say there is need for the three parties to co-ordinate their activities to avoid duplication, even competition against each other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There are too many players. Current programmes lack a common framework with regards to implementation,&quot; notes Witness Chinyama, an economist with the Zimbabwe development bank, whose 800 000-dollar factory shell programme in Harare has been relatively successful in creating employment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Details of a multimillion-dollar investment deal in South Africa by German car manufacturer BMW are to be revealed here this week but amid fear that a further increase in crime would lead to a review of the company's investments in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials announced in Johannesburg Sunday that the chairman of the Bavarian Motor Works, Bernd Pischetsrieder, will arrive in South Africa this week to detail the luxury car maker's planned 220 million-U.S.-dollar four- year expansion programme in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While successful implementation of the investment could result in BMW South Africa becoming the sole global manufacturer of the company's right-hand- drive vehicles, Pischetsrieder is expected to issue a strong warning of contingency plans to switch production to plants in other countries should the local subsidiary fail to meet export targets. Industry sources say that if this happens, it is unlikely that South Africa would ever regain the investments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pischetsrieder's visit is expected to ease tensions, following warnings by BMW and arch-rival Mercedes Benz that the increase in crime in South Africa was compelling them to re-assess their operations in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African media report that the government's tame response to the unceasing crime wave has angered local and overseas businessmen, who view the situation as a major threat to new investments and economic confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Violent crime in South Africa is regarded as a more significant deterrent to investment than the government's passive handling of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BMW spokesman Chris Moerdyk said the success of the planned expansion programme would be dependent on persuading car component suppliers to open in South Africa. This would be difficult, he added, if crime is not controlled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BMW is South Africa's leading exporter of cars and components, with earnings of at least 200 million dollars forecast for 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's special duties minister, Wada Nas, has accused the Untied States Information Service of supporting a pirate opposition radio, which has been transmitting anti-government programmes since June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Nigeria is dismayed that a United States agency could provide logistic support to an illegal radio station, carrying out destabilization acts against the government of Nigeria,&quot; he said in an interview widely published Sunday by Nigerian newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The location of the pirate radio, which calls itself Radio Democratic International Nigeria, has been a mystery since it began broadcasting June 12, the third anniversary of the country's 1993 presidential election annulled by the last military regime.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Exiled Nigerian opposition officials -- including Anthony Enahoro, of the National Democratic Coalition, and Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka, leader of the National Liberation Council of Nigeria -- have featured on the radio programs critical of the administration of Gen. Sani Abacha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas claimed that the Nigerian government had discovered involvement of the U.S. agency in the recruitment of staff for the foreign based opposition radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alleged that a Nigerian journalist had been interviewed for a job with the radio by Bruse Copohed, a public affairs staff of the U.S. agency, in Nigeria's northern city of Kaduna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas claimed that the journalist was interviewed July 14, as an Hausa language broadcaster for the pirate radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nas said that the U.S. agency in Kaduna was already preparing travel documents for the unnamed journalist to join the pirate radio abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria, Nas said, would protest to the appropriate quarters, adding that &quot; government would not tolerate any act by foreign agencies directed at destablization the country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neither the agency nor the United States Embassy in Lagos was open for business Sunday and so could not comment immediately on the Nas' allegation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic relations between the Nigeria and the United States have been strained since the cancellation of the 1993 presidential election, prompting Washington to impose limited sanctions on the West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomats in Lagos had interpreted recent comments by President Bill Clinton, when he received the credentials of Nigeria's new envoy to the United States, as a sign of possible improvement in the troubled diplomatic relations between the two countries. They still enjoy good economic links.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. buys some 50 percent of Nigeria's crude oil, while multinational firms have managed to block attempts by American and European politicians to impose economic sanctions on Nigeria, because of their vested interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Abacha government has also said that it abhors foreign interference to its plan to return Nigeria to democracy in October 1998.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Nigeria's Dutch soccer coach, Johannes Bonfrere, has resigned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am tired of fighting,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He led the country's under-23 squad to beat Brazil and clinch the gold medal in the Atlanta Olympic Soccer event. This was the first time an African team had done so.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking from his home in the Netherlands, Bonfrere shocked Nigerians with his announcement Saturday in a telephone hook-up with Nigerian television's live programme, Mastersports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I have sent my letter of resignation together with the bank papers of the 25,000 dollars I was accused of stealing,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His resignation was the climax of a game of hide and seek between him and the Nigerian Football Association. He said he had written to the association informing it of his decision not to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He claimed the association had treated him badly and that he would not reverse his decision to quit the 7,500-U.S.-dollar a month job.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, soccer analysts believe that behind the scenes negotiations, at the highest level, might make Bonfrere change his mind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bonfrere said his quit decision was supported by the U-23 squad. He expressed gratitude to Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, who had publicly announced a 1.5 million naira (about 145,000 U.S. dollars) reward for Bonfrere for steering the team to the Olympiad victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I thank the head of state, General Sani Abacha; Chief of General Staff, General Oladipo Diya and Nigerians for their great support,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The football association and Bonfrere have been at loggerheads since January following allegations of misappropriation of 10,000 dollars meant for accommodation of the national team in Kenya before the African Nations Cup staged in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria decided at the last minute to boycott the nations cup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another bone of contention was the 25,000 dollars handed him to prepare the soccer squad for the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta. The association alleged Bonfrere stole the money, an accusation he denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the end of the Olympiad, Bonfrere left for the Netherlands, protesting the &quot;shoddy treatment&quot; he said he received at the hands of Nigerian officials.  His absence from the celebrations that followed the country's Olympic success has attracted much comment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides monetary rewards announced by the Nigerian leader for the Olympic squad and its officials, a national honor, Member of the Order of Niger, was conferred on Bonfrere for bringing Nigeria the Olympic soccer gold.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">strike on Monday, defying a government order to end the work stoppage over a pay rise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Friday last week, Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister, Florence Chitauro, said all civil servants who did for duty that morning had been sacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the workers on Monday morning gathered at the Africa Unity Square, in central Harare, where they were addressed by the government employees body, the Public Service Association.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They then marched around town singing songs and went to every government building inviting some of the workers who had returned to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PSA President, Givemore Masongorera, told the gathering that some workers had been locked inside government offices and could not join the others on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nurses went on strike last Monday, demanding 60 percent increments and they were joined by the rest of government workers on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Sunday, President Robert Mugabe criticized the strikers and said the strike might be an opportunity for government to reduce the number of public servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, the striking civil servants also remained defiant and instead called for the resignation of the chairman of the public service commission, Mariyawanda Nzuwah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following president Mugabe's endorsement of their sacking and admission that he was made to understand that the civil servants would be paid a 20 percent increase, the strikers accused Nzuwah of misinforming the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What it means is that the president was given the wrong information about our increments which form the basis of our grievance,&quot; said a spokesman for the civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The civil servants, who were denied a bonus (13th cheque) last year, maintained that they received a nine percent increase based on three percent cost of living adjustment and six percent annual increment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Work at all government departments ground to a halt as several hundreds of them, including hospital staff, converged at a government composite block chanting and singing revolutionary songs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They unanimously agreed not to return to work until their grievances have been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government is using intimidating tactics by sacking us. It shows somebody somewhere is misinforming them,&quot; said the spokesman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said the unprecedented industrial action had the support of the country's labor movement, Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) which last week called on civil servants to form a single strong union to represent them effectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Scores of members of the public could be seen stranded at national registration and passport offices due to the limited number of senior staff dispensing services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unemployed hopefuls also mingled with the strikers hoping to be engaged following a directive last week from Chitauro to engage temporary staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it could not be immediately established whether the departments had implemented the instruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Mutare, some workers also remained defiant and did not report for duty.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - President Frederick Chiluba was on Saturday saved by South African President Nelson Mandela when the issue of Zambia's constitutional crisis was raised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Prime Minister of Mauritius raised Zambia's constitutional crisis as one of the topics on the Southern African Development Community's (SADC) agenda but President Mandela, the Community's newly elected chairman saved President Chiluba 'public' embarrassment when he proposed that the matter be discussed in private talks yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mandela yesterday met the Prime Minister of Mauritius, then President Chiluba followed by Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, in Pretoria in meetings SADC observers believed were connected to Zambia's constitutional crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chiluba looks like a lonely frightened man,&quot; a South African minister commented as he watched the Zambian President deliver his speech on Saturday.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier President Chiluba made an undertaking to meet all opposition leaders in a bid to resolve the country's political impasse at the SADC heads of state meeting in Maseru, Lesotho.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SADC sources confirmed that President Chiluba, who made the undertaking publicly and repeated it to leaders in private and journalists covering the meeting, promised to meet UNIP and former president Kenneth Kaunda first before other opposition leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba last night confirmed in an interview with ZNBC that he would be meeting opposition leaders. He also claimed he has been in touch with former president Kenneth Kaunda with whom he had discussions on the phone last week and he was at pains to say he was not under pressure from anyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And sources close to the former president confirmed President Chiluba's call but said it came on Thursday last week while Kaunda was in the High Court attending the treason trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Leader of UNIP in parliament Patrick Mvunga who wondered why the statement was made in South Africa, hoped President Chiluba would keep his promise and meet the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We were not aware that he was going to meet us but since he said this while in South Africa that he will meet us we verily hope he will do so,&quot; Mvunga said. And asked whether he believes President Chiluba will keep his promise Mvunga replied: &quot;Seeing is believing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But in Maseru SADC leaders are said to be skeptical because of President Chiluba's previous unfulfilled undertakings which he never honoured. They are now interested in the dates which President Chiluba will propose so they can monitor his time table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pressure has been mounting from donors and neighbouring countries on President Chiluba to meet the opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And indications that President Chiluba may now be willing to talk to the opposition have become apparent since Thursday August 15 when he telephoned the UNIP leader at his Kalundu home in Lusaka.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at State House, who revealed that President Chiluba telephoned Kaunda, said the call did not find the former president who was attending the opening of the treason trial at the Lusaka High Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But State House sources further revealed that President Chiluba left his telephone number and an urgent request that Kaunda returns the call immediately he arrives from the court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation director general, Steven Moyo,who is assisting the former president in the absence of Rabbison Chongo and press assistant Muhabi Lungu, confirmed on August 21 that President Chiluba telephoned Kaunda's residence on August 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moyo also confirmed that Kaunda returned the call the same day but declined to disclose or comment on what was discussed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am surprised that you know about the call but I cannot comment because the matter is delicate,&quot; Moyo said in an interview on August 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other independent sources, however, confirmed that President Chiluba has in recent times been under pressure from donors to break the impasse between himself and the opposition and they point to the telephone call to Kaunda as a possible move to break the deadlock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And State House sources also revealed that President Chiluba was expected to meet the former president either on Monday or Tuesday last week but could not say why the meeting failed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Former president Kaunda is said to have spent the two days at his Kalundu residence with minimum appointments waiting for President Chiluba's call while the President spent Monday last week on the Copperbelt ostensibly to obtain his voter's card and address a rally in the continued unofficial campaign for this year's elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The situation is unchanged. There was no contact on Monday or Tuesday. Dr Kaunda spent all the time here but nothing happened,&quot; Moyo said on August 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Moyo, who was willing to confirm an earlier visit to Kalundu by some church representatives involved in the secret contacts between State House and the Kalundu residence, was on August 21 still unwilling to discuss any other the details about the moves to bring the two leaders together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Moyo, general secretary of the Christian Council of Zambia Rev Violet Sampa-Bredt accompanied by secretary general at the Catholic Secretariat Father Ignatius Mwebe and Lusaka businessman Mwamba Kalenga visited Kalundu to meet the former president on Wednesday, August 14.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They spent three and half hours with president Kaunda, a meeting which established that the UNIP president was willing to meet President Chiluba at any time and at any place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trio also raised the issue of violence and how it could be avoided for peace to prevail in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It was obvious that there was a misconception from the church representatives about Dr Kaunda's position. They appeared to believe Kaunda was the potential source of violence but we hope this has been removed,&quot; a source who sat-in during the discussion said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other attempts to bring former president Kaunda and President Chiluba together but failed were made by the church through Nevers Mumba during his recent Victory Ministries Conference and St Paul's Church where the two leaders were expected to shake hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN - South Africa's political settlement involved &quot;costly&quot; compromises, and a suspension of armed struggle was achieved only after negotiations began, Dr Alex Boraine, vice chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission told an Irish conference on reconciliation today (Monday).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a summer school at the Glentree Centre for Reconciliation, near Dublin, Dr Boraine said that in South Africa &quot;it was through negotiation rather than prior to negotiation&quot; that the end of he ANC's armed struggle was achieved. Peace efforts in Northern Ireland have been dogged by disagreement between the British Government and Irish nationalists over similar issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A verbatim extract from the relevant section of his address follows: &quot;Many people both within South Africa and beyond its borders have described this transition as nothing short of a miracle. But the miracle didn't drop out of the sky. It had to be worked for, argued over and costly decisions involving compromise on both sides had to be made, the most important of which was that neither side could win through force of arms or violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State could not suppress the resistance to its system of apartheid, nor could the liberation movements overthrow the State through force. The stalemate had to be resolved and the only way forward was negotiation politics. This is a fairly well-known process and I won't develop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, one major point must be made: the State first demanded that liberation forces should surrender their arms and their arms caches and commit themselves to constitutional means of resolving t e conflict. The liberation forces, however, didn't trust the regime and refused to do this.  It was only when the negotiations started and people from both sides stared, and sometimes glared, at each other across a table that it was made possible by agree ent for the armed struggle of the ANC in particular to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In other words it was through negotiation rather than prior to negotiation that this decisive step was taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The SOKA GAKKAI (SG) group was recently in Ethiopia on a field visit to survey conditions of refugees in the country. The four-member mission consisted of Mr. Hiroki Nagano, chairperson of SG Youth Peace Conference, Mr. Congdon Smith, Public Information Staff of SG International and interpreter, Mr. Noriyuki Oshima, Seikyo Press Reporter, and Mr. Yuji Imago, video cameraman. They arrived in Addis Ababa on Saturday 27 July and by Tuesday were on a chartered plane on their way to Gambella to visit a Sudanese refugee settlement in Bonga. They then visited Somali refugees in Teferiber and Darwanaji in Jijiga. SOKA GAKKAI also paid a visit to the returnee villages around Jijiga.On Tuesday, the day of their departure, the mission was at the Jesuit Refugee Service centre for city refugees. It was there that Addis Tribune caught up with them to ask about their brief stay in Ethiopia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first question posed to the group was why they chose to come to this country and not to another African country. With Mr. Smith, the only American in the mission, translating Mr. Nagano said,&quot; We had talked about this issue with the UNHCR in Tokyo. Our conclusion was that we had been in this region before, we had visited Somalia ten years ago in connection to assistance to Ethiopian refugees residing in Somalia. We wanted to establish a certain amount of continuity of assistance and that is why we have chosen to come to this region, and Ethiopia in particular.&quot; He goes on to say,&quot; Of course in Africa there is a great deal of attention internationally to the Rwandan refugees crisis, Mozambique returning refugees, Angolan refugees. However there is a tendency, world-wide for not enough international media attention on the refugees who are not dying- the non- emergency cases. I think that is what we find in Ethiopia - these are the long term refugees. So we have come here to consider maintaining humanitarian aid for the refugees and their safe return to the countries of origin&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Undoubtedly the mission's stay in this country was too short to give them a comprehensive understanding of the refugee situation. And that is probably why when asked what they had observed, Mr. Nagano answered in general terms,&quot; The first observation we had was that one must look at refugee issues in the long term perspective. It takes a long time to resolve this issue because not only does the refugee issue involve the refugees themselves and the camps in which they live but also the community in which the camps exist.&quot;Mr. Nagano's observation that &quot;in many cases the areas that host refugees tend to be poor in relation to the rest of the country&quot; prompting the less better off locals to wish that they themselves were refugees, brought an understanding nod from the Jesuit Refugee Service employees. &quot;We in Japan, I don't think have very much experience in assisting refugees. So many times we'll think 'OK lets help refugees, what can we do ?' we will send them blankets, we'll send them food. But we don't know what kinds of food to send. That is why its very important for us to be here, to study the need of the society and the culture, and specifically the living environment&quot;.The SG mission has held talks with local administrators in both the camps and the communities as well as the refugees themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOKKA GAKKAI is, Mr. Smith translates, &quot;a lay Buddhist organization that was established in 1930 in Japan. Initially it was an educative group that was based on Buddhist ideals and it wanted to improve education in Japan. SG wanted to promote an education system that would promote the true needs of the student. Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, the first president, was imprisoned for going against official education policy. We want to create a better world through investing in education and culture and humanitarian aid.&quot; Asked what they will do once they get back to their country, Mr. Nagano said, &quot;Each year we have fund raising campaign to assist refugees. This year, on our return to Japan we will have one. We work in collaboration with UNHCR office in Tokyo and we will have to see what their recommendation is next year. But personally, we would like to create a continuity of assistance to refugee issues in Ethiopia.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - &quot;Two steps forward, one step back: progress in social development will be eroded if countries do not take natural disasters into account in their development planning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was one of the key messages that emerged from the UN-sponsored World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, in Yokohama Japan, in May 1994.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week 5000 people were displaced because of flooding in the Awash river.  The report did not give details of damage done by the disaster, but it is not hard to imagine that there were economic and other losses. There was also flood damage in central Tigray, Jimma and Bale Zones. In the southern part of Ethiopia, over 37,000 people have been infected by malaria. Damage inflicted by disasters kill many people each decade and leave thousands more homeless.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disasters make for society's worst ills: migration, poverty, disease and environmental degradation. Natural disasters may be perceived as unalterable &quot; acts of God&quot;. Yet disasters are the trade-off for ignoring environmentally sustainable development practices. As one United Nations expert put it &quot;Only gradually are a growing number of emergency management professionals become more aware that disasters are often unsolved development problems, a consequence of the choices we make in our every day lives.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Communities continue to expand into areas prone to earthquakes, landslides, floods, droughts and high winds. Poverty and over population, obvious root causes, need to be addressed if we are to be realistic about disaster reduction. Also, political commitment is required to reduce disaster.  Warnings must be heard at the highest political , as well as the lowest grass- roots level. On the other hand, the post-disaster period is often a good time to launch prevention and preparedness programs, because public awareness and political will are high.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Using only one boat, police in Bora district of East Shewa made desperate attempts to save over 1,000 people stranded after the Awash River burst its banks early this week. Crops and livestock loss has been reported elsewhere in the country, said ENA. The police department called for help including more boats to help the flood victims, but there has been no word on their success.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Midrock Ethiopia, a major company in Ethiopia run by Saudi Arabian business tycoon Mohamed Hussein Al Amoudi has further plans to expand. Al Amoudi is already Ethiopia's leading investor with 15 companies worth over $200 million.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'Day light Engineering' intend building three plants in coming years, and the 'Salam Health Care General Hospital' should be completed in Addis Ababa next year at a cost of 46 million Birr. Al Amoudi also has airline and car- dealership interests, as well as tannery, paints, plywood and a variety of other businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Region 14 Increases Rent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As of Wednesday, Region 14 Administration Bureau began implementing a new rent policy on its commercial spaces. According to the new policy, tenants will have to pay higher rates per square meter. This tough measure was brought about, reported the official Region 14 newspaper Addis Lisan, because of findings that proved that many of the tenants were not doing business but renting out the spaces at a profit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">420 Thousand New Telephone Lines Promised</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa will be getting two-hundred thousand new telephone lines in the next two years. The announcement was made by the Ethiopian Telecommunication Authority and quoted by Addis Lisan, official Region 14 newspaper. The total number of additional telephone lines to be put up around the country will be 420 thousand. Ninety-thousand out of the two-hundred thousand lines for Addis are expected to be up by the end of the 1989 Ethiopian Calendar budget year.  More than 90 thousand Addis residents are reported by the authority to be making use of faxes, telexes, and other forms of communication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Ye Wonz Maibel&quot;- The Sad Tale Of Ethiopia's Lost Youth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A premier screening of &quot; Ye Wonz Maibel&quot; , a documentary by Salem Mekuria was on at the Hilton Hotel on Tuesday 13 August. The film is a personalized account of events that took place in this country between the early 1970's and 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Through Salem's brother, Solomon, we are given an inside glimpse of the student movement that played a part in the overthrow of Emperor Haile Sellassie. With the use of photographs, letters from her brother, archival footage and paintings, Salem narrates the story of a generation and reconstructs the events that led to their near extinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is my story&quot;, Salem explains, and she tells it well. Through Solomon and Salem's best friend Nigist taking different sides, we are given a clear picture of the split within the students' movement. The distrust between members of a single family is brought to light in interviews with the relatives of the victims. The &quot;kill or be killed&quot; atmosphere of the time was evident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film carries a clear warning to the present generation of the need for dialogue and restraint from confrontation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Salem, an independent film maker for the last ten years, is a 1978 graduate of Education Media from the San Francisco State University.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ethiopian National team might make it to the 21st African Nations Cup.  On Sunday, to the surprise of all, the Ethiopian football team managed a 1-1 draw with Uganda in Kampala. Ethiopia was the first to open the score, a few minutes into the second half. If Ethiopia wins the next game, which it will be played on home ground, they will be grouped with Egypt, Morocco and Senegal. It has been sixteen years since the national team has gone through to play in the qualification matches.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on Sunday disclosing that a contingent of the Ethiopian defence forces crossed 75 km into into neighbouring Somalia on 8 August . The operation was, the statement said, &quot;aimed at destroying the bases and sanctuaries of the multi-national terrorist group,&quot; which have, &quot;for sometime been engaged in terrorist activities along the Ethio-Somalia border and in other areas within Ethiopia.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">ENA quoted a government spokesman who said that ten terrorists have been captured while ten others were wounded. The statement put at 232 the death toll for the other side, and 20 on the side of the defence force. The number of its injured was put at 17.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The spokesman said, &quot;The terrorist group has tried to use as an instrument extremists who failed and were crushed in their attempt to spread Islamic fundamentalism in Ethiopia.&quot; A detailed survey was said to have been conducted before the go-ahead was given to the defence force to destroy the base of the group. During the operation, ten communication radios, 93 explosives, a truck load of bullets and other vehicles were captured. Also reported to be in the hands of the defence force are documents captured from the other side, showing their military strength and future plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On Wednesday evening, Ethiopian Television showed what it said was the battle ground strewn with dead bodies of the fundamentalists.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - An Ethiopian lawyer practicing in the United States, Alemayehu G/Mariam, has recently requested U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to undertake a criminal investigation of the activities and policies of the U.  S. Embassy and the consular office in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A news release issued by Ato Alemayehu gives eight points for Attorney General Reno to focus her investigation on. The allegations include; whether the embassy's American consular personnel and Ethiopian support staff have accepted bribes in the form of large sums of money and precious stones from Ethiopian visa applicants; whether the embassy's support staff, with knowledge and complicity of the American consular personnel and others, have engaged and continue to engage in large-scale extortion of visa applicants; whether the consular and embassy officials maintain a policy of discriminatory and arbitrary treatment against members of the Amhara ethnic group; whether consular officials at the embassy maintain a policy of discrimination based on income and wealth, it is alleged that the embassy imposes visa criteria which allows only the wealthiest Ethiopians to qualify for visas to enter the United States; and whether embassy officials keep a list of names of Ethiopians and Ethiopian Americans who oppose the present leadership in Ethiopia. The purpose of this list is unknown.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Alemayehu is currently a full professor of Political Science at California State University where he teaches courses in American government.  He is duly qualified as an attorney and counselor of the Supreme Court if the United States. Ato Alemayehu said he informed the Attorney General that his allegations are widely circulated among Ethiopians in Ethiopia and the expatriate Ethiopian community in the United States. He called on the Ethiopian public to give their support and cooperation in addressing these allegations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In response, the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa have sent a release saying; &quot; The embassy has no comment on these specific allegations. The embassy does take allegations of impropriety seriously, and does investigate complaints about its operations. The embassy has full confidence that its consular section is abiding by all applicable laws.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - In an extensive interview with the popular Amharic weekly newspaper, &quot;Reporter&quot;, (Nehase 6, 1988 E.C.), the General Manager of the Investment Authority of Ethiopia, Ato Taddesse Haile revealed that the mechanism by which land in Ethiopia is being made available for investment at present is inefficient. He pointed out that although the recently enacted investment code stipulates that land for investment must be made available for an approved investment in 60 days, there is no certain way to enforce the legal prescription as land administration is within the jurisdiction of regional authorities. There is no punishment for non-compliance with the legal stipulation, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Touching upon the experiences of other countries with respect to making land available for investment, Ato Taddesse said that in some countries land is made available on the same day as investment certificates are awarded. In other countries the question of obtaining land is only a matter of three to five days, he said. Concerning the government's land-lease auctions, he pointed out that they lag far behind investment needs. The time intervals between auctions are extremely long, making it impossible for investment activity to be undertaken on a daily basis, he pointed out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In connection with the size of land made available through the official land lease auctions and other related matters, Ato Taddesse made the following observations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The auctions do not satisfy the requirements for all sizes of land. The size of land needed depends on the type and scale of investment to be undertaken, but the auctions are offered in only a few standardized sizes such as 2,000, 500 or 5,000 square meters. But what about land requirements ranging between 15,000 - 20,000 square meters?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The land lease auctions are not supportive of the country's investment policy and legislation. how long are investors going to wait for the sizes of land suitable for their particular investment projects? The land lease auctions should be synchronized with investment needs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The government should not see land as a means of making profits or generating large amounts of revenue. The idea of selling land for profit should not be the guiding principle. The focus should be on promoting investment which yields multifarious benefits, including multiple job- creating rounds of labour demand. It is through investments that exportable goods and services, import substitutes and products for domestic consumption are produced. The benefits derived from investment far outweigh any financial gains accruing from land sales&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Land lease fees are very high in Addis Ababa because demand outstrips supply, but in the regions land prices are not so high.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Investment promotion is not something that can be done by only one sector or a few sectors. All sectors which have anything at all to do with investment should work in harmony towards the goal of investment promotion.  To this end, essential services such as banking, customs clearance, regional administrative services and services rendered by the various sector ministries should be efficiently provided. In fact, a positive change in the attitude towards investment ought to be made.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In connection with the question of incorporating some of the opinions put forward by private investors into the new investment code, Ato Taddesse pointed out that the allegation made by some members of the business community that none of their ideas were considered in the drafting of the investment code is unfounded, because, he said, some ten of their suggestions were in fact incorporated into the investment code. He said among the suggestions rejected was the idea of allowing foreign participation in the domestic banking business. He said that since the reasons for this had been repeated several times, there was no need to mention them again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the definition of a domestic investor, Ato Taddesse indicated that such a person could be an Ethiopian or a foreigner with a permanent residence permit. Domestic investors, he said, are not allowed to repatriate their profits. A question that could be raised here would be: Would domestic investors of foreign nationality be permitted to repatriate the sales proceeds of their capital upon return to their countries of nationality? If so, wouldn't a more strict definition of a domestic investor based on purely Ethiopian nationality be necessary? How</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">could a foreigner who can repatriate his capital upon termination of his investment be given the same privileges as an Ethiopian who by definition cannot so repatriate his/her capital?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In enumerating some of the major positive changes made in the new investment code, the General Manager emphasized the following:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The minimum capital requirement has been reduced;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The technology transfer royalty tax has been reduced from 40 percent to 10 percent;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A loss carry-over privilege of up to five years has been granted;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A choice between straight-line or accelerated depreciation has been given;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The previous capital gains tax of 30 per cent has been abolished;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* More sectors are permitted for private investment;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Sectors for state, private and joint venture investment have been quantitatively and clearly defined;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Accompanying implementation regulations have been issued simultaneously with the parent proclamation itself;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The requirement which obliges foreign investors to deposit 125,000 birr in a blocked account prior to the commencement of the investment approval process has been abolished;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The Public Enterprises Supervisory Authority has been designated as the official organ which conducts negotiations with foreign investors;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the level of foreign investment over the past four years has remained woefully low. Only some 2 percent of the total number of investment projects approved are of foreign origin while in term of capital, the share rises to some 10 percent. The actual foreign investment implemented is lower still.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To wrap up this general presentation on the press interview given by the General Manager of the Ethiopian Investment Authority, we would like to raise a few questions of our own and put forward some broad suggestions. It is a good thing that some significant improvements have been made in the new investment code, but how effective would such legislation on paper be in the face of chronic obstacles in the areas of land availability, economic infrastructure such as transport, telecommunications and energy, deep-seated government red-tape and the general lack of investor confidence? The General Manager of the Ethiopian Investment Authority deserves praise for the bold manner in which he has come out on the problem associated with land availability. However, he seems to have shied away from going all the way and suggesting a definitive remedy for the problem. Since the land question is so central to the level of investment activity in this country and since it is one of the outstanding problem areas where something could be done with any reasonable dispatch, allow us the liberty to propose something that we consider to be a little bolder: permit private ownership of land along with other possible forms of ownership and put up a competently manned land administration authority (with appropriate powers of delegation) to sell off or otherwise dispose of state-owned land. Let us first agree on the general idea. Details could be worked out later on. Let an African &quot;tiger&quot; spring out of a freehold-based investment boom! Freehold for Ethiopians! Leasehold for the &quot;Ferenjis!&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It was a bitterly cold evening when Gladys Masai wrapped up in her winter coat and set off to visit her aunt in Brits. The journey from Pretoria should have taken about an hour and she was armed with a portion of fried chicken and chips to make the journey more palatable. She never reached her destination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead the 50-year-old domestic worker was abducted at knife-point from her taxi and subjected to a brutal gang rape in a remote spot outside Pretoria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to People Against Women Abuse (Powa) a woman is raped every 35 seconds in South Africa -- a recent Nedcor report claims the figure is every 18 seconds. Recent unsolved cases of serial femicide in Cape Town and Nasrec in Johannesburg are perhaps symbols of a society where crimes against women (particularly black women) are given less weight than other escalating violent crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many rapes go unreported (police believe fewer than one in 35 is reported) because of fear of secondary victimisation from insensitive responses from the police, medical officials and the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Ministry of Safety and Security has made provisions for more gender-sensitive training for police officers, there is a huge chasm between what is suppose to be done and what happens when someone like Masai reports a rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her ordeal began in the last weekend of June when the mother of four adult children was abducted by five young black men after boarding the mini van from the taxi rank at Marabastad in downtown Pretoria at about 5pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This man came up to me and said he knew a kombi which was going straight to where I asked for. There were two other male passengers inside, but I didn't feel scared,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Masai was told that her fare would be R30 and she sat waiting with the two passengers and the driver. Soon two other men arrived with bags of shopping and the driver declared that he would wait no longer as he had other people to pick up on the way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group set off with her sitting at the back of the van. Within minutes the men opened up their shopping bags to reveal bottles and cans of alcohol.  Masai grew concerned as they became increasingly coarse and rowdy. &quot;They grabbed a box of fried chicken and chips that I had with me and ate it,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The taxi drove around for about two hours with an agitated Masai begging to be let out, before the vehicle stopped at a secluded spot and she was dragged out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Two of them held on to me -- one with a knife -- - and said they were going to have some fun. The driver said he would meet them later and drove off with the other two passengers, who had stolen R600 from my purse.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sobbing Masai was pushed into a veld near a river and raped repeatedly by the men, believed to be in their late 20s. Her ordeal lasted several hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They told me not to move or scream or they would come back with others to rape me again and then kill me,&quot; she said. &quot;It was a freezing night but I was scared and didn't move all night.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was only at about 8am that she felt courageous enough to drag herself to a nearby roadside service station and beg someone to call her employer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Masai's ordeal was not yet over. Hereafter she was to experience the kind of apathy, lack of sympathy and generally tardy treatment meted out annually to thousands of women who are victims of rape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First it was the manager of the petrol station who refused to make a call to either the police or her employer. Thankfully a customer offered to do so on his cellphone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Her employer arrived soon afterward and when the police failed to materialise a couple of hours later, decided to take her to the HF Verwoerd hospital in Pretoria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Still the police did not come for a long time and I was not even examined by a doctor. It was as if no one but my boss cared,&quot; complained Masai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After several more calls two officers finally arrived at the hospital.  Despite having been told it was a rape complaint they were men. So a female officer had to be found. Several hours later she arrived, but only spoke Afrikaans.There was a further delay for a female officer to be found who could speak Masai's language. During the long wait Masai was was not examined by a doctor and therefore unable to wash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All this took place despite the urging of her employer, a senior civil servant who kept pushing for better treatment. As Masai said: &quot;Imagine what would have happened if I had been on my own.&quot; They got home at 2am the following morning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sally Shackleton at Powa says this kind of treatment is sadly commonplace. &quot; The system stinks to high heaven. Too often women are treated as if they had done something wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation is quite different in Port Elizabeth where the police have set up a special support centre with the help of local people to deal with rape victims. Its success can be measured by the fact that the number of reported cases rose from 28 in February to 103 in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inspector Juanita Blom, one of the volunteers, said this did not necessarily mean that incidents of rape had increased in the area, but that women now feel confident that they will be dealt with efficiently and sympathetically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The way the system works is that once a sexual offence has been reported at a police station in the Port Elizabeth area, the centre is notified and the complainant is taken there to make a statement. The information is fed into a computer which sends it back to the original station where an officer will begin investigating the case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the victim the centre offers a haven of support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She is examined there by a district surgeon in a fully equipped medical room. Thereafter she is able to shower, her clothes taken as evidence and fresh clothing provided. An appointment is then made for her to have counselling with a social worker from the police service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans are afoot to establish centres like this in major cities across the country. thanks to funding from the RDP and as part of the government's Crime Prevention Strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It will come too late to Masai, who believes she was raped twice -- the second time by the system which was supposed to assist her.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - FW de Klerk's testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission this week was widely billed as an &quot;apology for apartheid&quot;. In reality it was less a case of mea culpa than J'accuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African National Congress, he suggested, was more a hindrance to reform -- which was firmly on track from 1978 -- than a force for liberation. Where the atrocities of the &quot;dirty war&quot; in the 1980s were concerned, he had no knowledge of them. If they were committed, they were the work of the security forces on the ground, acting without authorisation. And even those atrocities had to be understood (excused, was the implication) in the context of &quot; unconventional&quot; warfare forced on the National Party government by the &quot; revolutionary&quot; onslaught of he communist-backed ANC. &quot;It would be a serious mistake to adopt a simplistic approach in judging such abuses and violations,&quot; he warned the commission.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More disturbing, however, than this exercise in historical revisionism, was his failure to acknowledge the suffering caused by apartheid. He appeared to be offering a defence for a few isolated human-rights abuses rather than a perverse and gigantic exercise in social engineering which literally wrecked the lives of millions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not as if he distanced himself from the years of &quot;grand&quot; and &quot;petty&quot; apartheid. He noted that his father was a cabinet minister under three prime ministers and conceded that &quot;I myself have always been a loyal supporter of the National Party. I supported its policies in the period before 1978 ...&quot; He even declared that &quot;I retain my deep respect for our former leaders.  Within the context of their time, circumstances and convictions they were good and honourable men ...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Party leader's failure to appreciate what &quot;apartheid&quot; represented to the majority of South Africans leaves one desperate to find a mechanism to bring some understanding home to him. At risk of over- simplification (which seemingly poses little risk where De Klerk is concerned) it might be worth seizing on an analogy he himself used before Desmond Tutu &amp; Co.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At one stage De Klerk told the commission it was a &quot;simple truth&quot; that &quot;no president, minister, commanding officer, business manager, or school principal&quot; could &quot;know everything which takes place within the realm of his or her managerial responsibilities.&quot; Let us choose the principal and extend the metaphor, rolling up in this august person the &quot;honourable&quot; men to whom De Klerk referred -- DF Malan, JG Strijdom, Hendrik Verwoerd, BJ Vorster, PW Botha and (for the sake of continuity) De Klerk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our principal rules over a school which, through force of demographic circumstance, has a student body which can be arbitrarily divided. For novelty's sake let us leave aside pigmentation of the skin and choose the colour of their eyes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Our &quot;honourable&quot; principal announces that, for anthropological reasons which he is unable to substantiate on any scientific grounds (a detail which detracts not an iota from his sense of God- given certainty), the blue-eyed girls and boys are superior to the brown, the green, the grey and all the rest of them (the amber are &quot;honorary blue&quot;, because Jones's father is rich, but that is a by- the-way).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Henceforth, our honourable principal declares, the blue-eyed kids will sit at the front, on chairs behind desks with pencils, books and sharpeners while the rest will muddle along on the floor where they are invited to do their sums with fingers in the dust. The polyocular lot will anyway be excluded from all classes which teach anything more than the basics of hewing wood and drawing water, because the colour of their eyes make them unqualified for any higher education. They are also condemned to sit at the back of school assembly, to sleep at the windy end of the dormitory and to serve as fags to the blue-eyed kids while avoiding any social intercourse with them on pain of a sound whipping to both parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This dispensation creates such a sense of over-bearing superiority among the blue-eyed pupils that a number of unsavoury incidents ensue, the most memorable being the occasion when a particularly gifted brown-eyed kid is cornered in the school toilets and beaten to death on the grounds he is uppity. When some tearful students report this unfortunate incident to the Latin master he declares that the boy's death &quot;leaves me cold&quot;, a sentiment which draws no complaint from the oh-so-honourable principal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rumour of the state of affairs in our school filters out beyond its high walls and word gets back to the honourable principal that lynch-mobs are forming in the neighbourhood. Already alarmed by reports from snitches in the student body that the polyocular students are plotting to put broken glass in the scrambled eggs they are forced to serve up to the blue-eyed kids every morning, he has a Damascene experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inviting the parent-teachers' association (previously banned) to form a school board he appears before them to say: &quot;The teachers are proud of the role which they have played, in conjunction with others, in putting our school on the road to peace, prosperity and reconciliation ... we have gone through a period of deep self-analysis and we are indeed renewed from within .  .. we are prepared to admit our many mistakes of the past and are genuinely repentant ... we have apologised ... we have also forgiven ... can I have my job back ?&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Burundi's overwhelmingly Tutsi army has killed several thousand civilians since the military coup three weeks ago. Its offensive against Hutus has concentrated on a swath of territory across the centre of the country, as well as land bordering rebel camps in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Survivors accuse the army of using mortars and heavy weapons in attacks on groups of unarmed women, children and men, with no insurgents in sight.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A foreign official who works closely with Burundi's army said he had no doubt that when Major Pierre Buyoya seized power late last month the military took it as a signal for a new assault on Hutu rebels and civilians alike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's clear this is more than the retaliation against civilians we had before. The army has taken on thousands of recruits and there's an operation in blocks of the country to clear people out,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They are just going from hill to hill killing people. The army says it is killing rebels, but the problem is soldiers see Hutu civilians and rebels as one and the same, and that's how they treat them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The continuing bloodshed will do little to help Buyoya win over neighbouring governments, despite his announcement that he will soon appoint a new civilian Parliament and that within three years he will bring in some kind of democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Burundi has won just one concession from countries imposing the regional blockade which has shut off international flights and closed land borders: United Nations aid convoys arrived from Tanzania yesterday, the first since sanctions were imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a sign of increasing militarisation, Buyoya has replaced four civilian regional governors with army officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among those removed from office is the governor of Gitega province, where much of the killing is taking place. Tharcisse Ntibarirarana, a Hutu, had publicly condemned a massacre of Hutu students by their Tutsi classmates while the army stood by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military has been tied to other massacres in the province. Survivors of assaults in Giheta commune, in eastern Gitega, say an army attack launched two days after the coup is continuing. Victims accuse the military of shelling people who have fled their villages and sought shelter on hillsides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although independent verification of death tolls is almost impossible, foreign human rights workers say they believe the violence in Gitega province alone has claimed more than a thousand lives. Last night hillsides in Giheta, set alight by the army, were still burning amid reports of more killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some survivors say they believe the army is attempting to carve out safe areas for Tutsi peasants by clearing Hutus from their land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The head of military intelligence, Colonel Jean- Bosco Daradangwe, denied that a co-ordinated offensive had been launched but did admit civilians were dying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The army is sometimes undisciplined,&quot; he said. &quot;The acts of indiscipline are just isolated incidents, so people don't have to be afraid of the army as a whole. The tension between the army and the people is dissipating quickly.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Major General Salim Saleh peered through his Ray-Bans and pointed out beyond the army base to the green plains that stretch northwards from the little town of Gulu towards the Sudanese border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yes, he's out there,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe 15km away. His raiders are hiding out in the swamps and the forests. Will he attack Gulu again?&quot; he shrugged. &quot; It's possible. Aren't you frightened staying around here?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the early Eighties, the general played a key role in the &quot;liberation war&quot; against Milton Obote. Now his half-brother, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, has recalled him from life as a businessman (current interests: airline food, publishing, gold prospecting) to lead the fight against a very different guerrilla leader who has brought chaos and a peculiarly brutal brand of terrorism to northern Uganda.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The man Saleh is determined to track down is Joseph Kony, a former Catholic altar boy and herbalist who targets civilians rather than the military, and specialises in the mass abduction of teenagers and even children, of both sexes. He has acquired a mythical status among local people who believe the stories of his supernatural powers as leader of the so-called Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They should be called the Devil's Resistance Army,&quot; said Saleh. &quot;Everyone in the district except me seems to believe in witchcraft. Their prisoners are killed if they don't accept his ideas. Even the girls he takes are taught to fight, and are married off and raped. The people are scared. They've killed 50 or 60 people in the last week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Five miles outside town, the latest victims had been laid out along the roadside. Eleven villagers were killed overnight, apparently because they had refused LRA orders not to live so close to the highway. Some had been shot, others hacked to death with a hoe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One old woman had been spared but ordered to set fire to her own hut, which was now a smouldering pile of ashes. Her two sons had been taken away by the rebels. She said she didn't know how she could go on living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni hoped he had finished with religious- inspired uprisings in the north after the defeat of the Holy Spirit Movement, led by the &quot;prophetess&quot; Alice Lakwena, who devastated the region during her 1987 rebellion. Kony, said to be her cousin, picked up where she had left off, took control of the remnants of her forces and began an even more brutal campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has been helped by the traditional hostility of the Acholi people to the Kampala government and by terror tactics he appears to have learned in south Sudan. Here, in the vast, lawless region that marks the border between black Africa and the Arab north, where there has been fighting for decades between different rebel militias and the Sudanese government, there has also been a history of child abduction. Some has resulted from inter-tribal feuding but in recent years there have been reports that government-backed militias were involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kony has made such abduction the basis of the terror campaign. Over the past three years, thousands of young people have been captured from villages and schools in the area around Gulu and forced to join him. His current raids -- the most devastating so far -- are believed to be carried out by enforced conscripts he captured last August. His aim, according to the Ugandan military, is to capture 10 000 more. In the last three weeks he has already succeeded in abducting several hundred, who are now being marched back towards Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sixteen-year-old Beatrice Atim is lucky she's not among them. On the night of July 25 she was asleep when the rebels surrounded her dormitory in the little mission school of St Mary's College, out in the countryside five miles from Gulu. The girls were ordered out at gunpoint and taken down to the town, where the raiders stole salt and crates of soda. The girls were told to carry them, on their heads, as they were taken north towards the Sudan border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some managed to escape during an attack by helicopter gunships of the Ugandan People's Defence Force. Others -- including Beatrice -- were simply abandoned in the bush because they were incapable of walking further. This is not the usual LRA practice. Most who can't keep up are killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, back in class and dressed in her blue and white school uniform, Beatrice said she was frightened the rebels would come back. Eleven of her class-mates who didn't get away are still out there with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their prospects are not good, according to Aldo Ocen, the &quot;community mobiliser&quot; at the World Vision Trauma Centre in Gulu, which offers counselling and help for those who manage to escape from the LRA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 1 200 young people, aged between eight and 22, have been treated here since the centre opened 17 months ago, in a little compound on top of a hill overlooking the plains that stretch towards the Sudanese border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's not the ideal place for therapy, with the rebels still just a few miles away. The sound of gunfire and mortars often echoes at night around a battered little town that has become increasingly nervous since its electricity transformer was shot up. But Aldo's current group of 169 &quot;clients&quot; are grateful that here, at least, there are Ugandan soldiers to guard them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All have horrific stories to tell. Aldo says that one in five has been involved in killings, usually of fellow abductees who tried to escape. They were forced to beat their fellow prisoners to death with sticks and stones or else be killed themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;And after that they enter a different world where killing doesn't matter.  They know they've committed a crime and they don't want to go back to the government side. Then they are ready for the rebels' military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The girls have the worst psychological problems. They are forced to have sex with th LRA commanders, to cook for them and act as their wives -- but never eat the food they have prepared.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christine Anena is one of those attending the centre. She was 15 when she was abducted last September and taken to southern Sudan, where she was &quot; forced to be married like a wife&quot; to one of the LRA officers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He had three other wives besides me,&quot; she said in a near-whisper, staring blankly ahead of her, &quot;and we each had a day when we had to sleep with him.  We had to do what we were told or we were beaten. People were killed for disobeying military orders.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In one of the rituals that all LRA members must go through, she was smeared with shea nut oil: &quot;They believe it gives you strength and courage and makes you holy. It cleanses you like a holy spirit, and you can fight without fear.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She was involved in skirmishes with the SPLA, the guerrilla militia fighting the Sudanese government in south Sudan, and in &quot;looting and burning people's houses like a robber. I don't know if I killed anyone.&quot; She escaped when the LRA brought her back across the border to Uganda in May and she too was still terrified &quot;because the LRA always vowed they would recapture any deserters&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As the killings and abductions continue, there's a danger that this could become an international conflict. The Ugandans accuse the Sudanese of helping the LRA, just as the Sudanese government accuses the Ugandans of helping the SPLA in south Sudan. Both claims are almost certainly accurate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ugandans' latest weapon in their propaganda battle against Khartoum is policeman Benson Ojera, who was abducted last August and chosen by Kony as his trusted personal bodyguard. Ojera escaped back to the Ugandan side last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If his eyewitness accounts are correct, the Sudanese have provided Kony with weapons, food and medicine -- though not direct military training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Museveni, clearly embarrassed by the continuing rebel attacks, has already sent his half-brother 5 000 ex-servicemen who have been recalled to join the estimated 12 000 troops already stationed around Gulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saleh is under pressure to get results. He admits, privately, that as a soldier he'd like to chase the LRA when they cross back to Sudan &quot;but that's not the policy yet -- the government really has to think about that. The LRA will go on killing until they are killed.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Some three million patients across South Africa receive medication from their doctors every month. By the end of September, the Department of Health will have changed this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dispensing doctors have united to slam proposals by the department to curb their right to dispense medicines. They say it will drive up the cost of health care for the poorest sector of society.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The National Convention of Dispensing Doctors (NCDD), which represents 7 200 of South Africa's 8 000 dispensing doctors, says most of their patients live in disadvantaged areas where there are no pharmacies or where facilities close after working hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our typical patient cannot afford to take time off work to see the doctor, so he visits the surgery after working hours, long after the day hospitals accept their last patients for treatment,&quot; said NCDD representative Dr Theodore Rai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;By the time he leaves the surgery, if there is a pharmacy in the area, which is often unlikely, it will be closed. It is too dangerous for him to take public transport to another area to find a pharmacy, so he relies on his GP to dispense medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What the department is doing is removing the GP's tools to treat the patients. Many people who see doctors in disadvantaged areas don't just want to hear that they have gastroenteritis or bronchitis, they expect the doctor to help them cure it as well.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not true, said the department's chief director of registration, regulation and procurement, Bader Pharasi, who is steering the draft regulations to withdraw doctors' rights to dispense medicines. The department wanted to ensure patients receive medication from the people best trained to do so -- practising pharmacists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pharasi said the department had found shocking examples of unsafe and unhygienic premises in visits to 1103 dispensing doctors. Medicines were not properly labelled with names and usage instructions, syringes were re-used, premises were dirty and medicines were stored at room temperature instead of in refrigerators.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the amendments to the Medicines Control Act, which will require doctors to receive additional training and certification before they are allowed to dispense, was aimed at providing patients with the best service.  Doctors were not trained in pharmacology, and dispensing doctors' premises were not inspected regularly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Traditionally, throughout the world, diagnostic and dispensing services are separated. The department has been investigating this issue since 1994 and we are not advocating a total ban on dispensing doctors, we just want to ensure they are properly trained to do the job properly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He admitted pharmacies were not widely available in disadvantaged areas, and said the department would examine introducing regulations to make it incumbent on existing pharmacies to open after hours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rai said he doubted the department's &quot;survey&quot; of 1 103 dispensing doctors had been scientific. There were existing channels to censure dispensing doctors who practised in unhygienic conditions or prescribed the wrong medication. The Interim Medical and Dental Council could take action against these doctors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I find it strange that the department is sitting on these examples of bad practices among dispensing doctors and using them as a tool to justify their actions. It claims to have shocking evidence, but it has not referred these doctors to the council for disciplinary action. It is completely derelict in its duty to the public.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Doctors and other interested parties have been given until the end of August to comment on the proposals. The NCDD has sent a memorandum to the department objecting to the proposals and has asked patients to write to Minister of Health Nkosazana Zuma, expressing their opposition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are also concerned that the changes will push up the prices of medication. &quot;We see indigent patients who pay between R30 and R60 for consultations and get their medication free. This makes up about 30% of our members' patients,&quot; said Rai. &quot;These people will have to go to state hospitals -- we estimate they would total about 600 000 patients each month.  State facilities are already overburdened, and it is unlikely that these people would receive better care than we provide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'We also have contractual agreements with trade union sick funds to provide their members' medicines at cost price. I doubt whether pharmacies will provide medicines at cost. The only patients from whom we make a profit are those who belong to medical aid schemes, and believe me, those bills are scrutinised, so there is little chance of profiteering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pharasi said doctors who provided medication for sick fund members would be &quot;treated on their own merits&quot;. If it was in the patients' interest for them to continue dispensing, the department would have to ensure those doctors were competent to do so.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NCDD is outraged by the department's failure to consult it before publishing the amendments in the Government Gazette in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The department only met us in April, after we requested a meeting and paid for a venue. We asked for a follow-up meeting to present our case, and were allowed one delegate in a meeting of 30 people,&quot; said Rai.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pharasi admitted the department had only consulted two organisations, representing dispensing doctors in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal, before publishing the regulations. But the department held workshops on the issue last year and had used the media to publicise its new policy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - In a flashback to the past, the censors published a list of banned magazines last week. Why?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's chief censor, Dr Braam Coetzee, says he feels like &quot;lying down and saying, 'Carry me off the field.'&quot; He and the 50 or so housewives, retired school inspectors, theologians, lecturers and teachers who judge films, objects and publications under existing censorship laws are &quot;waiting to hand over the keys&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last week, the directorate published a shortlist of banned magazines. Such lists used to appear regularly, with anti-apartheid pamphlets and political tracts jostling for room among all the skin-mag titles. With new liberal legislation being dealt with in Parliament, the sudden reappearance of the list drew surprised comment. Was this the last kick of a dying horse, a last- ditch bid by the censors to reassert their right to pronounce on what citizens should see and read?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those feeling vulnerable to moral onslaught have diligent Narcotics Squad members to thank. Coetzee's committees act only on complaints, and they went into action after being handed a cache of magazines seized in a Narcotics Squad raid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time magazines were judged undesirable in terms of the Publications Act of 1974, which the new Film and Publications Bill will replace, was in May. They included copies of Hottest Asian Babes, Lusty and Thrills Readers' Wives, and were also handed in by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the Publications Control Board, pickings have been slim for some time.  Coetzee is surprised, &quot;even amazed&quot;, that so few publications arrive for scrutiny; instead, &quot;99% of the job&quot; involves pre- screening films for classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Either people have given up, or it's because new legislation is in the offing, or people are simply making their own choices. We're still operating in terms of the Act. Even if Parliament approves the new Bill, as expected, it will take a few months to set up the new structures. We're guessing that by January everything will be done by the new board,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Given the new constitutional rights of freedom of choice and expression, what will be okay in terms of the new Bill? If it's a bona fide literary, dramatic, documentary, scientific or art work, just about anything goes. But the Bill draws a line at photos of child sex or &quot;a lewd display of nude children&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Bill provides for a Film and Publications Board which, on complaint from the public, can rate as XX, and ban for distribution, magazines, films and videos carrying photos of child sex, explicit violent sexual conduct and bestiality -- as well as &quot;degrading sex&quot; and explicit violence, which must amount to incitement to cause harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">So what's child sex? According to the Bill, it involves a person under 18 (or presented as being under age) taking part, engaging in or helping another person to engage in &quot;sexual conduct&quot; or &quot;a lewd display of nudity&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sexual conduct&quot; means stimulated or aroused genitals, genitals lewdly displayed, masturbation, intercourse (which includes anal intercourse), fondling or touching genitals with an object, the penetration of a vagina or anus with any object, and oral-genital or oral-anal contact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to one expert, &quot;lewd&quot; was added to avoid the axe falling on material like David Hamilton's soft-focus shots of nubile, cheesecloth-clad teens. Will a family snap of a scantily clad little girl playing the vamp send parents for the high-jump? No, says Professor Kobus van Rooyen, former Publications Appeal Board chief and leader of the task group appointed by Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi to draft the Bill: &quot;Lewd must be narrowly interpreted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We tried to delineate areas and leave some leeway for interpretation. The aim was to use adverbs and adjectives, rather than the sweeping terms of the past, such as 'indecent' or 'obscene'. If you want laws in this area you must leave room for motivated discretion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the amendments by the parliamentary portolio committee was to insert &quot;degrading sex&quot; in the XX category, the impetus coming from African National Congress MPs driven by a strong women's lobby. The task group was opposed, believing it to be too vague -- and it may be challenged in the Constitutional Court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It's defined in the schedule as &quot;explicit sexual violence which degrades a person and which constitutes incitement to cause harm&quot;. One expert suggested material showing a woman to be enjoying rape would qualify. The Bill provides for appeals all the way to the supreme court, so again, interpretations are likely to be narrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Material rated X18 -- non-violent, explicit sex and visuals of genitals -- will be available only at adults-only, specially licensed shops. Another category, R18, will cover material that, judged within context, may be harmful or disturbing to children under any age up to 18 years, and which will be restricted, in the case of films, or sold in a sealed wrapper if a publication.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Afrikaans-medium universities are living on borrowed time.  The South African Student Congress (Sasco) this week placed Afrikaans tertiary institutions firmly in the firing line after last weeks clashes at the University of Potchefstroom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four people were arrested during violent student demonstrations -- the latest in a series of confrontations between Sasco members and the management of tertiary institutions over the transformation process on Afrikaans campuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But central to these increasingly racial clashes among students is language.  Sasco is clear -- it will not accept Afrikaans universities which use language as a means to exclude other racial groups from tertiary education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">White student leaders on Potch campus say they will resist any change to the current language policy. They say Sasco threatens what is most precious to them -- their language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Stephenie Allais, Sasco's education officer, said: &quot;The use of Afrikaans makes these institutions inaccessible to a large percentage of black students.  This is unacceptable for a public institution.&quot; An institution she pointed out which is funded by taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potchefstroom receives 47% of its funding from the state, the balance is received from private donations and university fees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The University of Pretoria, which has seen similar clashes, has already implemented various programmes to accommodate the needs of other language groups and is attempting to phase in English courses as quickly as possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco has refused to participate in any student organisations and has withdrawn from the Potchefstroom's Transformation Council, until after a university summit next month. At the summit, the major stakeholders in the transformation process will thrash out their grievances, among them language.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to an agreement reached by Sasco and Potch's university management after last week's demonstrations, the governing body will, in the short term, have to &quot;discuss the existing language policy in order to deal with problems in the present situation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although the Potch campus, surrounded by the rich maizelands of the North- West province, was tranquil earlier this week, black and white students avoided each other near the administration block, ironically known as &quot; Lover's Lane&quot;, site of last week's demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sasco says it doesn't want people to feel there is any attack on Afrikaans, but that no language should dominate another. What they would like to see is Afrikaans universities and colleges implement a dual- or parallel-medium of instruction where students are offered lectures in either English or Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But white students at universities like</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potchefstroom see this as a direct attack on their &quot;culture and traditions&quot;.  Students at &quot;Pukkies&quot;, as the students call the university, see these traditions threatened by Sasco.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing chairman of the Potch student council, Dirk Herman, says Sasco has hijacked worker/management disputes to further its own aim. These worker issues have to be removed from the transformation process, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although university management might be preaching transformation and racial tolerance, the message isn't filtering down to the lecture theatres.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have a very clear position on the student council, that this is an Afrikaans university and must stay an Afrikaans university,&quot; Herman said. He believes Afrikaans students have a constitutionally guaranteed right to be taught in Afrikaans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This has been dismissed by several constitutional experts at the University of Witwatersrand who say neither the interim nor new constitution make such guarantees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Herman accepts &quot;Pukkies&quot; is a national asset, and must produce graduates, but he says, Potch must remain an Afrikaans institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The problems on campus are not racial, but political.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Smuts Matshe, local Sasco chairman, says the structures at Potch are only there to keep the status quo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At national level, Sasco accuses Potchefstroom of &quot;window dressing&quot;. And it says racial tensions are so high its members are afraid to sleep in the hostels for fear of reprisals after last week's demonstrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sasco doesn't even have an office on the campus. How can we transform this university if we don't have any access to resources?&quot; said Matshe from the public phone at his hostel, his only means of communication with the outside world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The language issue, Matshe believes, needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. &quot;Right now the university is only satisfying the resources of a minority group.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They are all paying university fees and students should have at least some say in the medium of instruction they receive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Potch's vice-chancellor Professor Carools Reinecke, the main language is Afrikaans according to the university's founding charter. However the charter makes provision for other languages to be used if the university's senate approves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Part of transformation in my opinion is democratisation. We need to engage in open and frank discussions. But we have to remember that we have to fulfil the expectations of management, staff and students,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reinecke hopes the recommendations by the Commission on Higher Education on tertiary education, will help guide the university's transformation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Doctor Johan Hendrickz, marketing director at Pretoria University, the commerce faculty already offers all its courses in both English and Afrikaans and half of the engineering courses are now offered in parallel-medium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The university's stated policy is that we will not use any language to exclude people or as a form of discrimination.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iain Currie of the Wits Law School believes the days of strictly Afrikaans- medium tertiary institutions are numbered. &quot;They are just not palatable in today's current political climate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said instruction in Afrikaans is being squeezed out at tertiary institutions. This, he says, has already been happening at other Afrikaans universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Potchefstroom it seems is the last to follow the trend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mining giant Gold Fields has finally admitted its men's only hostel system may be at the root of violence which left 28 workers dead in the past month on three of its mines. Gold Fields representative Marion Brower said the company has begun setting up forums -- a move to integrate workers regardless of ethnic origin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brower said the forums would bring together workers to discuss integration as a means to quell violence between the predominantly Zulu union, United Workers' Union of South Africa (Uwusa), and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). However, she said though Gold Fields wanted to solve the violence urgently, management at the different operations &quot;moved at their own pace&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NUM said the violence among workers, which management has put down to conflict between Zulus and other groups, was a result of an outdated Gold Fields policy of allocating workers to hostels along tribal lines. Nearly all of Gold Fields' 90 000 miners around the country live in the hostels. Brower said &quot;most of the Gold Fields mines (hostels) were traditionally segregated&quot;, but workers could now request to move.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The death of NUM East Driefontein branch treasurer Lesaoana Rapopo from gunshot wounds last week sparked off violence between Uwusa and NUM members underground. Seven miners died during conflicts last week, bringing to 20 the number who have died violently in the past three weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This Monday another four miners were killed in violence underground at Leeudoorn, another of Gold Fields mines, near Carltonville. Similar conflict was also reported at Northam, near Thabazimbi in the North-West province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The regional co-ordinator for NUM in Carltonville, France Baleni, accused mine management at East Driefontein of deliberately stalling the integration process by &quot;giving Uwusa the final say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consultations with all workers should not hinder progress. And mine management is only pretending to be facilitating talks (between NUM and Uwusa) but they are the ones contributing to the violence.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uwusa representatives could not be reached for comment this week.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A controversial army general and former spy chief is at the centre of a row over a R50-million management consultant contract to transform the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Rival consultants have complained about the award of the transformation tender to leading consultancy Deloitte &amp; Touche, says parliamentary defence committee chairman Tony Yengeni who intends to investigate claims that the tender process was handled incorrectly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the centre of the row is Major General Marius Oelschig, formerly logistics supplier to the Angolan rebel movement, Unita, and commander of Ciskei's army at the time of the 1993 Bisho massacre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">General Oelschig is now in charge of the armed forces' transformation and was head of the SANDF evaluation committee which recommended the State Tender Board select Deloittes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rival contractors have complained about General Oelschig's close relationship with Deloittes. The general worked closely with the firm for two- and-a- half years on another transformation project which won him and them an international award in June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There have also been questions about the coincidence between the Deloittes tender and the sum set aside by the SANDF for the contract. The military had secretly earmarked R50-million for the project. Deloittes pitched its tender at R49,59-million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Oelschig's military background makes him a startling choice as the man tasked with leading the armed forces in shedding its apartheid legacy. His career has included a substantial stint in military intellgence where he was at one stage director of special tasks, responsible for co-ordinating UNITA.  He then became the military attache to France. When he returned to South Africa he took up another post with army intelligence, before becoming chief of the Ciskei Defence Force in 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1992 Oelschig, fluent in both Portuguese and French, returned to the national army and has since been involved in various transformation projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The award of the transformation tender to Deloittes was first announced in the State Tender Board's gazette in March. But it was only reported in the commercial press in June. It is understood the delay resulted from complaints lodged by the other bidders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The public sector director at Deloitte and Touche, Pierre Tredoux, told the Mail &amp; Guardian the transformation project it had worked on with General Oelschig was different from the work it would now be doing -- it had involved &quot;building a complex decision-making model to help the SANDF decide on how best to deploy its resources&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tredoux denied rumours that Oelschig would soon take up a consultancy post at Deloitte &amp; Touche. He said he had a firm contract with all his clients that he would not recruit them at any stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SANDF Colonel John Rolt said Oelschig had only worked with Deloittes during the latter stage of the award-winning project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yengeni said at this stage he did not want to comment on the appropriateness of Oelschig steering the SANDF's transformation. &quot;At this stage I do not want to link Oelschig's background with his current transformation work for the SANDF.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Human Rights commissioner Max Coleman cites &quot;personal reasons&quot; for his decision to resign from his post. But the word in human rights and legal circles is that his action was prompted by disillusionment fuelled by differences of opinion with Human Rights Commission (HRC) chair, lawyer and theologian Dr Barney Pityana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Coleman would not be drawn on the issue this week. &quot;If that's what people are saying, then that's what they are saying,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not want to comment. It's a non-issue.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His resignation takes effect in October. While he says he &quot;will leave in good spirits, convinced the commission will go from strength to strength&quot;, those he leaves behind will mourn the loss of a man who had &quot;a huge contribution to make&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversies which have marked Pityana's tenure as chair of the HRC so far are said to have fed the veteran human rights campaigner's unhappiness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First there was a highly publicised confrontation with Professor Dennis Davis, whom Pityana called a racist for criticising the HRC's lack of profile and suggesting that appointees, selected from political party nominees, were being rewarded for &quot;services rendered&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A subsequent controversy involved the Sunday Times, which reported in June that creditors were after former Pan Africanist Congress official Henry Isaacs, once an associate of Pityana. It reported that he was being sought by creditors, faced numerous fraud charges and had an unpaid default judgment awarded against him for R20 000 in unpaid rent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pityana accused the newspaper of being part of a vendetta against Isaacs.  But it appeared Pityana acted on what Isaacs had told him without hearingthe newspaper's or the creditor's side -- prompting an editorial condemning his &quot; cavalier use of power&quot;, which the newspaper said threatened the dignity of the HRC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But while some critics see Coleman's decision to quit as evidence of a deeper malaise affecting the commission's ability to function properly, others see the body's problems as structural.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Entitled to 67 staff, the HRC is negotiating for 83, but has only 15 people on board. This excludes the commissioners, of whom four are part-time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Difficulties included delays in getting premises allocated by the Public Works Department; in having the commission's regulations promulgated; and in employing staff -- all caused by a welter of red tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The greatest obstacle, which will persist, is the difficulty of moving fast within the public service,&quot; says the HRC's chief executive officer, Louisa Zondo. &quot;We had received complaints by the time I joined in May, but we couldn't act. The commission's powers were promulgated on May 17.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She said the commission's R6-million budget was inadequate: &quot;Nobody had a clear idea of what our work would entail when it was set.&quot; This could be overcome by networking with other agencies and securing foreign and private- sector funding for projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The appointment of former journalist John Mojapelo as media and public relations officer is expected to remedy the HRC's relative lack of profile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile its first hearing is pending: senior legal officer Liesl Gerntholtz said the case involved a student at the Durban College of Education who faced expulsion because she was pregnant and unmarried. It was one of about 15 complaints since July that would involve investigation and public hearings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The commission has launched a nationwide investigation into abuses in prisons, prompted by letters from hundreds of prisoners complaining of assaults by warders and gangs, bias in the parole system, racial discrimination over work and food allocations and inadequate treatment of prisoners with HIV/AIDS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of about 325 complaints received since June about 150 had been processed.  Most were matters that could not be dealt with ahead of the new constitution's certification, which will see the Bill of Rights applying between private individuals and not just between the state and individuals, and because of the absence of any civil liberties legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Other matters the commission was dealing with included violations of patients' rights in mental health institutions, the position of black children at predominantly white, Afrikaans-speaking schools and alleged abuse of street children by police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pityana could not be reached for comment by the time of going to press.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The first time Olympic gold medalist Josia Thugwane received any support from South African sporting authorities was when he arrived at Johannesburg International Airport to depart for the Games in Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On that occasion he was given a kit bag which held two Springbok strips to add to the six pairs of running shoes which had been donated to him over the years by a major sports clothing firm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Six weeks on and Thugwane and his family are getting ready to move into a house bought for them by the Mpumalanga government. He is chauffeur-driven everywhere and carries a cellphone donated by the National Olympic Council, &quot; because they haven't found me a sponsor yet,&quot; he explains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While these newfound luxuries are very welcome, Thugwane says he could have done with some support a lot earlier in his career. &quot;When I had nothing it was hard to keep going, I wish I could have got some help then,&quot; he told the Mail &amp; Guardian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But it's very nice that everybody wants to help me now and I'll take whatever I can get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Thugwane first came to the attention of the national athletics federation when he won its national championship in 1993, Athletics South Africa's chief secretary, Banele Sindani, says he was not given any funding for coaching or equipment because long-distance runners &quot;tend to go their own way&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;They concentrated more on making money from running marathons and this is very successful for many. We tend to concentrate on track and field athletes who can benefit more from training and funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That said, Sindani's organisation only has the scope to deal with 20 athletes in the run-up to Sydney 2000 and their programme is already full. &quot; Of course, we would like more money but the government has other priorities like housing, education and health, only then can they look at us and we understand that point. Although we don't have an affirmative action policy here, we do try and help black athletes as they're usually in need of more assistance than others.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For some Olympians the situation was very different from that of Thugwane's.  In 1994, Durban City Council spent R14-million refurbishing and heating their Olympic-sized pool, so that Penny Heyns and other Olympic hopefuls could train there during the winter months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The obvious imbalance in sporting facilities for young black and white athletes, a large factor in the overwhelmingly white team which the Nocsa sent to Atlanta, is unlikely to be redressed soon, according to Sindani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sports Minister Steve Tshwete admitted this week that paucity of sports facilities in township schools is a major source of concern to him and affirmed that the issue is a priority for his department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it's unlikely the racial mix of the team which goes to Sydney in four years' time will be significantly different from the team which went to Atlanta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Echoing the sentiments of many of the coutry's new sports administrators, Sowetan sports editor Molefi Mika maintains it will be many years before young black athletes can enjoy the success of their white counterparts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's not really surprising when you think in some of the townships they hardly have a running track or a swimming pool. I don't mean an Olympic pool, I mean any pool.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - When South Africa take the field on Saturday for their second match in the Test series against New Zealand, once again the only black players on the pitch will be wearing the opposing team's colours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the row over the South African Rugby Football Union's (Sarfu) commitment to the new South Africa still simmering, Sports Minister Steve Tshwete this week admitted to the Mail &amp; Guardian that his power to coerce the rugby authority was limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking after a meeting with Sarfu officials on Tuesday, Tshwete said: &quot; We've made it quite clear that if they don't follow our suggestion, then they are living in the past. We have to keep putting pressure on them and persuade, persuade them. We have no other means.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can't take a big stick and beat them -- unfortunately funding isn't something we can use against them. They are even richer than my department.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tuesday's hastily convened meeting came as a result of the sports minister's criticisms of Sarfu's development policies last week. On the day the Springboks suffered their second successive defeat at the hands of the All Blacks, Tshwete asserted that the association's development policies were nothing more than a ploy to get white rugby back into the international arena.  His outburst provoked an angry reaction from Sarfu, but this week the minister went on to make the point further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Blacks are already finding it hard to identify with what they are calling a lily-white team. If there is no visible development at upgrading black players at junior levels, then the Springboks will forever be a white team and they will not be representative of this country.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tshwete's comments were especially injurious to Sarfu, given their timing at the end of a week when the association launched its new development programme, a high proportion of which concentrates on the promotion of the game in the black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly on the surface, the association appears ready for change. An impressive development budget shows R15-million spent already this year, a sizeable percentage of which was used to provide and upgrade facilities for young black players. In the Blueprint for a Dream brochure, which accompanied the launch of the development programme, it's difficult to spot a white face.  Even the association's new letterheads are printed in Xhosa along with the traditional English and Afrikaans, although the effect is somewhat negated by the choice of Leon Shuster as the musical accompaniment on their telephone answering system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The association strongly denies its embracing of the black community is purely cosmetic. Sarfu's commitment to the new South Africa is so strong, according to chief executive Rian Oberholzer, that &quot;the Springboks are the only team selected on merit. All our other representative teams are chosen with an affirmative action policy. With this new programme, we're going even further to develop black interest in the game.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Tshwete is not convinced: &quot;Their development programme is porous in a number of areas. They need to go back and tighten up their development of black clubs. Neither are they paying attention to the development of the game in black schools.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result of Tuesday's negotiations was a temporary truce between the sports ministry and Sarfu. Tshwete says he will now wait to see whether the association will act on his recommendation, namely the setting up of a rugby academy &quot;which will concentrate on the develpment of players of colour&quot; and a heavier emphasis on the development of black clubs. With both the minister's and Sarfu's repeated emphasis on developing the game at junior level, it's unlikely that South Africa will field a proliferation of black players at senior national and provincial level in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While the authorities continue to thrash out policy, the mangement of one of Gauteng's handful of black rugby clubs, Eldoronians Football club in Lenasia, says that Sarfu's new initiatives will have little effect on their week-to-week activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We've got our allocation from the Transvaal Rugby Union, it's unlikely that Sarfu will give us more,&quot; says club chairman Marlon Adams. &quot;We find that the unions are not really interested in helping out black senior players. If there's a black and white player at junior level, each with the same potential, then you'll find the rugby union will take each of them away and watch their development, give them training and so on. If you have a black and white player with the same potential at senior level, then they'll only be interested in the white player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year with the aid of four white players, the second division team progressed to within two places of promotion. This season, their fortunes haven't been so good. &quot;We lost our white players,&quot; explains Adams. &quot;We didn't have the money to pay them and they left. We wrote 40 to 50 letters to companies looking for sponsors and we couldn't get one. A lot of them say 'You belong to one of the richest rugby federations in the world why don't you ask them for money'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lack of funding is something plenty of white rugby clubs have in common with Eldoronians. However a credibility problem is not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some people still think it's strange to see coloured people playing rugby and it's hard for them to take us seriously,&quot; says Adams. &quot;Racism is by no means gone from the game. It's not what it used to be say three or four years ago but it's not completely out of rugby and it won't be for another 20 or 30 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The eradication of racism from rugby is something in which the media can play large part, according to Sarfu's chief exectuive. Maintaining that the development of the game was not just down to his association, Oberholzer said the media can and must play a part in changing the perception that rugby is a white elitist sport and that black players don't want to participate in the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Responding to his comments, Moplefi Mika, sports editor of the Sowetan said that if there were more black players in the game, his newspaper would allot more coverage proportionally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Show me a black Springbok, show me a black Western or Eastern Province player,&quot; he said. &quot;If they were there, we'd put them in our paper.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mika also questioned the commitment of the current senior national side to developing the game into a non-racial one. &quot;Recent things suggest that some people haven't been honest and the Springbok captain Francois Pienaar is one of them. Nelson Mandela fought hard against opposition to give them their Springbok emblem and this is what they say as a thank you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Pienaar portrays himself as a captain who has support in the black townships. Then he goes and welcomes the old flag to games. I'm not sure these guys know what they're doing.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The KwaZulu-Natal offshoot of People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) is a politically conservative shadow of its Cape-based mother body, with mainly National Party supporters rallying around calls to confront homosexuals at gay bars and &quot;deal forcibly&quot; with doctors performing abortions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Led by a Muslim activist, a Hindu priest and a Christian pastor, the mainly Indian group has transcended the &quot;Muslim&quot; stereotype attributed to the controversial Cape movement, but has failed to win support from the province's Muslim left wing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 200 Pagad supporters marched in Durban last week under banners echoing the recent NP election slogan, &quot;Hang the killers, hang the rapists&quot;.  Pagad leaders say the other targets cited during the march -- homosexuals, abortionists, gamblers and prostitutes -- are those of a separate</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">organisation, the National United People's Organisation (Nupo). The leadership and many members of Pagad and Nupo are, however, one and the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Drugs and gangsterism are the current issue,&quot; says the chairman of both organisations, Rashid Suleman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Pagad's Hindu leader, Vedic Pandit Randuth Nagaser, says he has doubts about Nupo's alliance with Pagad, as he opposes violence, critics say Suleman's greatest claim to fame is a recent debacle when he was caught carrying a gun in court during the emotive trial of two men charged with murdering Chatsworth schoolgirl Natasha Sookdeo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad's Christian secretary, Pastor Eugene Perumal of Chatsworth's Soul- Savers Outreach Mission, is more candid about the group's objectives: &quot;Pagad is limited to gangsterism and drugs. Nupo is also targeting shebeen lords, abortionists, homosexuals, prostitutes, and morality in general. We are one group, two organisations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Perumal says the group wants to work with police and remain non- violent, he adds: &quot;We are armed. The people are armed. If the need for violence arises, it will take place.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the group intends protesting outside Durban's gay bars to urge homosexuals &quot;to repent&quot;, and will demand that doctors and back-street abortionists stop performing abortions. &quot;They are going to be seriously approached. If they refuse, we're going to take them out by force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is this approach, which comes from sections of the community which opposed the armed struggle of the liberation war, that has kept the Muslim left wing at bay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslim Youth Movement has reserved judgment on Pagad for the time being: &quot;We strongly feel Pagad has the right to do something about evils in its community, but we don't want people to take the law into their own hands,&quot; says the movement's secretary, Saydoon Sayed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Organisation for Civic Rights leader and African National Congress member Iqbal Mohammed blames Suleman for the poor response to Pagad in Durban: &quot; Pagad's development in the Cape was grassroots, but Suleman has no standing in the community.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad's strongest message of support comes from the conservative Muslim council, Natal Jamiat-ul-Ulema, which says it &quot;shares the concerns&quot; of Pagad and warns that if the government fails to act on crime, &quot;more and more groups will emerge to do battle with the criminals&quot;. It has stopped short, however, of supporting Pagad's call to arms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad) called off a march to drug dealers this week, but the organisation said this was not evidence that it has run out of steam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pagad representative Farouk Jaffer said the decision was taken because Pagad did not want a violent confrontation with the police. The movement was young, and its actions so far were just the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Faithful members gathered at the Gatesville mosque on Tuesday night, where they received updates on the organisation's progress while their leaders conducted a press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaffer and co-leader Ali &quot;Phantom&quot; Parker, whom police are seeking to question in connection with charges of sedition and murder, poured scorn on the police's ability to deal with crime and to arrest them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaffer said until the police began arresting drug dealers and gang leaders, Pagad would continue with its &quot;programme&quot;. Last Saturday the organisation cornered a man selling Mandrax in Athlone and poured petrol over him. He managed to escape before being set alight. The man was not arrested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Pagad would continue to visit dealers to &quot;conscientise&quot; the police about them. &quot;We will be witnesses, the police will have to arrest them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jaffer and Parker said they had spent most of last week travelling to other parts of the country in response to calls to launch Pagad elsewhere. They had helped establish the organisation in Kimberley, in Lenasia and Laudium in Gauteng, in Pietersburg and in Paarl in the Western Cape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 400 supporters -- considerably fewer than at Pagad's previous gatherings -- gathered at the mosque on Tuesday night. The gathering was monitored by a heavy police and army contingent, and it dispersed quietly after being told the march was off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parker dismissed police attempts to arrest him and Jaffer, saying his continued freedom was evidence that the &quot;whole police system has collapsed&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both men's homes were raided last week and another Pagad leader, Nadthmie Edries, was arrested and charged with sedition. He was released on R10 000 bail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sedition is described in South African law as &quot;gathering together with a group of people with the intention of ... subverting the authority of the government&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Cape Town newspaper reported that detectives were investigating charges of sedition and murder against Pagad. The public has been asked to assist the police in tracking down Parker and Jaffer. Police warned that Parker was &quot; heavily armed&quot; and should not be approached if spotted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Yet, since the raid, both Parker and Jaffer have appeared at Pagad gatherings. Parker addressed supporters at a gathering at the Gatesville Mosque last Friday and the two hosted this Tuesday's press conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Armoured vehicles surrounded the mosque before the press conference, but no attempt was made to arrest or question the two Pagad leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Western Cape police spokesman Superintendent John Sterrenberg said reports that police were intent on arresting Parker and Jaffer were incorrect. They were merely &quot;invited&quot; to assist police with their ongoing investigation into the sedition and murder charges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sterrenberg said the searches of Jaffer's and Parker's homes were conducted within the parameters of the Criminal Procedure Act and the police involved did not have warrants for their arrest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The two men were not approached during their appearances at the mosque because &quot;it would be extremely insensitive, to say the least, for the police to enter the sanctuary of a place of worship&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He conceded, though, that a case of sedition would have to be made against more than one person.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Mo Shaik, chief of the National Intelligence Co-ordinating Committee (Nicoc), is to quit his position at month-end for a new post in either the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Trade and Industry. Smart money is on the latter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An announcement is expected shortly, but it is understood Shaik's new job will see him based in Europe, working with South African trade representatives and devising ways for the country to achieve greater penetration of the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is likely to be replaced as Nicoc co-ordinator by African National Congress MP Linda Mti, who currently chairs the National Assembly's Portfolio Committee on Safety and Security and who has played a key role in Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nicoc advises the government on intelligence policy, co-ordinates the activities of the country's intelligence agencies and advises the government on threats and potential threats to the country and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The intelligence committee is currently chaired by ANC MP Lindiwe Sisulu- Guma, recently appointed deputy minister of home affairs. Speculation as to a possible successor saw the spotlight fall on ANC MP Jennifer Schreiner, but she is believed to have declined the position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Inkatha Freedom Party national caucus chairman Lionel Mtshali (60) faces an uphill battle as he prepares to take over the national Arts, Culture, Science and Technology portfolio next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Outgoing minister Ben Ngubane has set the ball rolling on far-reaching legislation in the young ministry and his departure to the KwaZulu-Natal legislature will deprive Mtshali of much-needed transition guidance from the ministry's first incumbent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pulled off what was to be the IFP's first ambassadorial posting to Argentina, Mtshali will now have to build a working relationship with the African National Congress-dominated departments under him, while balancing the demands of the vocal artisitic and scientific communities, as well as those of South Africa's myriad cultural groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A loyal founding member of the IFP, decribed by others in the party as &quot; very close&quot; to IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Mtshali first rose to prominence in the KwaZulu government when he replaced former IFP secretary general Oscar Dhlomo as education and culture minister in 1991. He is credited with promoting the art of Zulu dancing during his tenure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Passed over by his then deputy, Prince Vincent Zulu, for the education post in the KwaZulu-Natal government, Mtshali has since played a key role in implementing party policy within the national caucus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is a former school teacher, principal and school inspector. He is well travelled and has a history of promoting education in rural communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He holds a master's degree in education from the University of Orange Free State, with undergraduate degrees in education and history from Rhodes, Unisa and the University of Zululand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - South African baboons are being exported to the French military so that they can be exposed to radio-activity in experiments designed to test the safety of nuclear plants in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earthlife Africa this week released official documents to show the French Ministry of Defence has applied to South African authorities for at least 20 baboons captured in the wild to be exported to France so that they can be used in tests to &quot;evaluate the subclinical effects of irradiation doses experienced by people during an accident in a nuclear power plant&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The documents show the baboons will be exported by the Centre Africain de Primatologie (Cape), a research unit in the Hazyview area of Mpumalanga that has previously been implicated in cruel treatment of animals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The export application states the research will be conducted in conjunction with the University of California Los Angeles, at a laboratory in Gren-oble owned by the French army's health services. The application says the &quot;general conditions of experimentation&quot; have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the French Medical Service Research Centre.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a local animal rights organisation, South Africans for the Abolition of Vivisection (Saav), says it has evidence that animals used in military laboratories are often subjected to experiments involving tests on chemical weapons and explosions. The organisation also questions why research regarding civilian nuclear power stations is being conducted by the military.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Although the stated goals of the experiments are to try to develop ways to protect soldiers/people from radiation effects or to improve treatments, the programmes mainly demonstrate in animals what has already been known from human exposures. Furthermore, such experiments are not carried out to advance the treatment of human injuries but to test the efficiency of weapons of war - - in this case nuclear weapons,&quot; says Michelle Pickover from Saav's research committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earthlife Africa's Johannesburg branch has written letters to Environment Minister Pallo Jordan and Colin Cameron, director general of the Department of Environment Affairs and Tourism, demanding that South Africa's involvement in the international trade in primates be banned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Warwick Humphries, co-ordinator of the Johannesburg Earthlife branch, says baboons are protected by the Convention in International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), of which South Africa is a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the provisions of Cites is that the capture and trade in primates not be permitted if the population of wild primates is not known. As this population has not been determined, the permitting of the exportation of baboons is a flagrant violation of Cites,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cameron was not available to comment, while Jordan said he would consider action after a report-back by his department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cape was the subject of controversy in 1990 when investigators from the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) discovered 122 wild baboons and two vervet monkeys in cages on its premises. The premises appeared to be abandoned and the animals were starving. Some had been kept in cramped cages for more than a year and could no longer extend their limbs.  The baboons had to be killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Documentation in the possession of the Mail &amp; Guardian refers to the export of &quot;six large male baboons&quot; to French army research laboratories already in 1993, and to visits to Cape by French military personnel -- as well as members of South Africa's Roodeplaat covert chemical warfare laboratory -- in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Controversy around the capture and translocation of wild animals is set to escalate in conservation circles as SABC-TV news this week uncovered evidence of high mortality rates involved in the capture and transport of rare suni antelope and zebra herds in the Kruger National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kruger's chief warden, Harold Braak, told the M&amp;G a large number of zebras had died during a recent capture operation in the park because sedatives given to the animals were incorrectly mixed. A number of suni antelope which had been rounded up so that they could be moved to the northern parts of the park also died because their feed had been watered and a toxic weed grew in it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braak rejected accusations that these incidents were the result of &quot;callous&quot; behaviour on the part of parks officials. He said translocation was necessary to manage game effectively and to ensure that rare or endangered species could be reintroduced to wilderness areas where they had vanished. In the case of elephants, capture and transport of herds has become an alternative to culling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;These operations are warranted, but it does happen that there are losses.  I have strong feelings about the way animals are treated, and we have veterinary officers monitoring operations to ensure that problems are minimised. We have nothing to hide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He added that outside organisations -- including Earthlife, Saav and the SPCA -- would be welcome to monitor game-capture operations in the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braak also confirmed reports that trainee game rangers at Kruger were required to shoot a charging elephant as part of the course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The elephants are chosen and then chased with a helicopter towards the aspirant ranger. The stress on the elephants is immense,&quot; says an anonymous letter from a Kruger Park official. &quot;Some wounded elephants are chased for kilometres by the chopper before they are put out of their misery.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Braak said only rogue elephants which break out of the park and harass surrounding farmers are chosen for this purpose. He noted that the practice had been terminated earlier this year -- apparently after the SPCA had contacted the park authorities to query evidence of undue animal mortality in Kruger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Neil Fraser, manager of the Wildlife Division of the National SPCA, said his organisation was already monitoring game-capture operations in KwaZulu- Natal, the North-West and the Free State, and would now extend these activities to the Kruger National Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa has a huge game-transport industry because of the large number of new state and private reserves that are growing in various parts of the country -- and is probably a world leader in this field.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew McKenzie, chairman of the Wildlife Translocation Association of South Africa, says the National Parks Board generally has a good record with capture and transport of game, mainly because properly trained vets are involved in the operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the greatest problems and mortality -- usually caused by a condition called &quot;capture myopathy&quot; that sends animals into severe shock -- take place when private companies get involved in unregulated capture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The SPCA and the Wildlife Translocation Association are serving on a committee, along with a number of other agencies, to devise a code of conduct to regulate the industry.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - President Nelson Mandela and his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, this week backed Defence Force Chief General Georg Meiring in his battle to keep details of South Africa's apartheid-era chemical weapons programme from the public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts on Wednesday had to hear part of a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) submission on &quot;Project Coast&quot; in camera -- after Mbeki ruled an earlier cabinet decision to lift the secrecy on Coast did not apply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Democratic Party MP Ken Andrew, chair of the committee, later said he was &quot; disappointed that so many elements of this still remain secret to the public&quot;, and that &quot;African National Congress (ANC) members in particular&quot; were upset about it. ANC MP Llewellyn Landers said: &quot;There was some unhappiness and also an attitude of 'We don't really understand why (the secrecy) is necessary.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is not clear why the executive has decided to back, at least for now, Meiring's attempt to keep an apartheid-era project under wraps. Wouter Basson, former head of Project Coast, is known to have maintained links with Libya as early as 1993 and still after the 1994 elections. The exact nature of Basson's visits to Libya -- a country with which the ANC government has better relations than the National Party government had -- is not clear.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NP leader FW de Klerk dropped a hint this week when he told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that agreement had been reached within the Government of National Unity that some details of covert operations not be disclosed &quot;in the interests of South Africa&quot; -- and that he and Mbeki had both served on a top-level ministerial committee monitoring such operations.  De Klerk's spokesman Fanus Schoeman confirmed the chemical weapons programme could be an example of the type of operation covered by the &quot;framework agreement&quot; of the GNU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The chemical weapons programme was set up by the SADF in the mid-Eighties under the cover of a number of front companies, chief among them Roodeplaat Research Laboratories and Delta G Scientific. The SANDF maintains Coast was for defensive purposes only, but a Sunday Tribune report last weekend claimed projects included research into a bizarre sterilisation scheme to stem black population growth, and on poisons possibly used against anti-apartheid activists like Reverend Frank Chikane, who now heads Mbeki's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The privatisation of the front companies in the early 1990s, a process in which prominent Project Coast operatives pocketed state assets totalling more than R50-million for an investment of as little as R350 000, attracted the attention of the Office for Serious Economic Offences (Oseo). Among the chief beneficiaries was former special forces soldier Philip Mijburgh, nephew of Magnus Malan. Malan, as defence minister, had been party to an April 1990 decision to privatise Roodeplaat and Delta G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In late 1994 Oseo reported to Justice Minister Dullah Omar on its investigation, saying it needed permission to follow the flow of funds overseas and asking that the secrecy on the project, regulated by the Protection of Information Act, be lifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Omar sent the request to cabinet, but a decision was not taken until April 3 this year, delayed by counter-presentations from the NP and the SANDF.  Cabinet's decision reads that &quot;Oseo be authorised to continue its investigation abroad&quot; and that &quot;the secrecy measures surrounding the project Coast be lifted.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A dispute over the interpretation of the Cabinet decision arose when Meiring, appearing before the public accounts committee on May 15, did not provide full details on Project Coast. He undertook to supply more details later, but asked that the committee hear it in camera. Andrew replied his committee operated in the open, saying he understood Cabinet to have lifted the secrecy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meiring wrote to Andrew again last week, saying: &quot;It is my understanding that Cabinet has given permission for the lifting of the secrecy measures surrounding the project to enable the Oseo to complete its investigation. It is not our understanding that authorisation has been given for a revelation of all the project information and we have as yet not received any directive from our minister to release classified technical and operational detail of the project to anyone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a Defence Ministry insider said, there appears to have been extensive lobbying by &quot;the generals&quot; of Deputy Defence Minister Ronnie Kasrils, who has been handling the issue. On Monday, Mbeki wrote to Andrew backing Meiring's contention that the cabinet decision to lift the secrecy was relevant only to the Oseo investigation. &quot;I would like to confirm that on April 3 1996, Cabinet approved the lifting of secrecy measures surrounding the project to enable the Office for Serious Economic Offences to continue its investigation overseas on financial matters related to this project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Any further decision by Cabinet concerning the secrecy provisions affecting this project can only be taken after the conclusion of this investigation. However, we agree that the chief of the SANDF should answer all questions put by your committee to him. To enable him to brief the committee fully on the project, we request that the hearing be held in camera.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo confirmed the letter had been sent to Andrew, but said it was merely a confirmation of a second cabinet decision on the matter, about a month ago. He denied it had changed the April decision, saying it was merely a &quot;clarification&quot;. Repeated approaches by the Mail &amp; Guardian to Cabinet Secretary Jakes Gerwel for confirmation of the second Cabinet decision failed to elicit a response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana confirmed Mandela backed Meiring's interpretation. He said: &quot;The view would be an overall lifting can be considered once the Oseo investigation is over ... There is no intention to impose permanent secrecy on the matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mbeki and Mandela's interpretation appears to be at odds with earlier statements by members of Omar's ministry. Omar failed this week to answer questions about the original intention of the April decision. Kasrils also did not respond to repeated approaches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Correspondence between Meiring and Andrew also revealed that Mandela holds the key to disclosure on operational details and the results of the chemical warfare research conducted by Roodeplaat and Delta G.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meiring said in his letter last week that &quot;elaborate security arrangements implemented on instruction of the president make it impossible for the SANDF to access this information without the explicit instruction and co-operation of the president&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the information was captured on a computer optical or CD- ROM disk. SANDF spokesman John Rolt confirmed De Klerk had approved the security measure. &quot;The present president, after he was briefed, endorsed them.  Therefore the current president can lift them.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mankahlana said Meiring's statement referred to &quot;an existing set of circumstances&quot; and that it was not Mandela's own decision -- he was &quot;acting in Cabinet&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the end, the public accounts committee learnt little new this week. Oseo investigator Dawie Fouche testified that a five-year research contract between the SADF and Roodeplaat was cancelled by the SADF on the same day Roodeplaat was privatised and transferred to Mijburgh and other colleagues in August 1991. The termination of the contract meant the SANDF had to pay these new owners R32,6-million in &quot;cancellation fees&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andrew said the in camera session was cut short due to a lack of time shortly after the SANDF had started its briefing. He said Oseo and the auditor general were taking the matter further now, but that the committee &quot; will take it further in due course&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC's submission to the truth commission has commendable qualities. It is detailed, in some respects frank (for example in disclosing the names of people executed by the ANC's intellegence operations), and it is often peruasively argued. But it is also too much of a lawyer's defence rather than what it should be: a moral acknowledgement of the extent to which the organisation transgressed human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document makes a general claim that its strategic aim did not involve attacks on the civilian population which constituted the political base of the apartheid group. This is broadly true. The ANC's attacks did kill civilians, sometimes intentionally so, but this was never an absolute requirement of the strategy it adopted.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC contends that it took a principled stand against terrorism and that it avoided attacks on easy targets. This is less easy to sustain. It is true that on occasions the ANC argued against the use of terrorism, but it did not always criticise its cadres when they carried out attacks which had a principally terrorist function nor did they always disassociate the organisation and its leadership from such attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chapters three and four of the present evidence do sustain an argument that the ANC was involved in a just war -- the chapters mainly detail human rights violations by various South African governments until 1994. I have no major objections either to the evidence or the argument. I think that the degree of repression which existed in 1961 was of such character that the ANC's decision to embark upon armed rebellion was morally defensible</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In chapter five the ANC argues that it consistently adopted a relatively restrained approach to the use of violence, that cadres were trained and disciplined to avoid or at least minimise civilian casusalties. Generally, this is convincing -- there was plenty of evidence at the time that ANC cadres took precautions to avoid killing or hurting civilians, black and white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Quotations from leadership statements are deployed to show how the ANC attempted to govern the conduct of its warfare -- but it is not clear that the language had a restraining effect. It was often, as in the cases of some of the phraseology quoted here, rather unclear in its meaning and implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ANC rhetoric between 1985 and 1988 was susceptible to different interpretations. The document does not acknowledge the leadership's responsibility sufficiently during this period for those attacks which did occur on soft targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document deals in detail with a number of particular attacks that involved civilians. It justifies or explains some of the attacks which were ostensibly directed at soft targets in various ways: by referring to and defending the ANC's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">understanding of what constituted a military target (Pretoria car bomb, rural landmines, Magoo's bar); by blaming others on cadres panicking because they would not, if captured, be accorded prisoner-of-war status; and attributing other soft target attacks either on the state's dirty tricks or on a context in which increasingly embittered cadres acted upon their own initiative (Amanzimtoti).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This part of the submission is too vague to be totally convincing. Between 1977 and 1989 at least 1 426 attacks were attributed to the ANC. Some indication of the precise scope and scale of ANC armed activity and the casualties it inflicted would be welcome: there is none here. Moreover there were some attacks on soft targets which were too well planned and too sophisticated to have merely been impulsive on the spot reactions by junior cadres to aparheid atrocities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example the 1988 Ellis Park car bomb, if mounted by the ANC, would have required the co-ordination of several units and fairly sophisticated technology. The document makes no mention of this incident. Are we to understand that it was an operation mounted by the authorities to discredit the ANC? Or was it sanctioned by the ANC's chain of command? This is not an isolated example. Even at the cost of a longer submission more detail should have been provided.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report contains a section on the activities of ANC-aligned self-defence units during the 1980s. It suggests that any crimes committed by such bodies were mainly the result of efforts by state agencies to subvert the ANC's activities and discredit the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Certainly, as with the case mentioned in the report, the Phola Park SDU, this did happen -- but are we to assume that all SDU misbehaviour was the consequence of &quot;third force&quot; conspiracies? Was not some the consequence of the propensity of badly trained and badly disciplined ANC supporters to bully people and exploit their relative power?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of these abuses were the result of police manipulation, but a lot of abuses committed by activists in the name of the ANC reflected a militarist sub-culture which the ANC itself did much to foster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On abuse of human rights within the organisation, this document reproduces the findings of its own previous internal commissions of inquiry. Some people would argue that these commissions did not go far enough in identifying perpetrators of abuses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The document says nothing about abuses in camps which may have taken place before the late 1970s, yet there were allegations of these from ANC defectors as early as 1968: if these can be refuted they should be.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ANC says it consistently condemned the practise of necklacing. It did -- but not immediately. Indeed, in some statements it appeared to give it some moral sanction. For example, Chris Hani in an interview to mark the 25th anniversary of Umkhonto (December16 1986) had this to say with reference to necklacing:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is not a weapon of the ANC. It is a weapon of the masses ... I refuse to condemn our people when they mete out their own traditional form of justice to those who collaborate ... The necklace has been used against those who have been actively collaborating with the enemy. We say the movement should be vigilant to ensure that whatever sentence is passed on anybody, it is as a result of participation by revolutionary elements of our struggle&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text in which these quotations appeared was published by the ANC and circulated widely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In conclusion: in comparative terms -- with reference to the general conduct of liberation wars in other parts of the world -- the ANC fought a clean war. And if any armed rebellions are morally justifiable, the ANC's decision to take up arms was certainly defensible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is a pity, though, that this document takes such pains to &quot;contextualise&quot; every abuse and violationof human rights committed by the organisation -- at times this effort comes close to excusing the inexcusable. As a consequence the moral weight of this document is diminished.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The ANC's armed struggle never amounted to more than a &quot; sporadic and symbolic endeavour&quot; despite a moderately high cost in terms of deaths and casualties, says an unpublished account of the liberation movement's military tactics written by a former member of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The study by Howard Barrell, entitled Conscripts To Their Age: African National Congress Operational Strategy, 1976 to 1986, presents a very different perspective on the ANC's guerrilla activities to that presented in the organisation's submission to the truth commission this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Umkhonto weSizwe did not develop its armed struggle beyond the sporadic, symbolic endeavour it was when the ANC first resumed attacks inside South Africa in 1976, despite numerous decisions and attempts to do so,&quot; says Barrell in his Oxford University doctoral thesis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The work is probably the most exhaustive account of ANC strategy and draws on extensive interviews with leaders and members of the ANC and its military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;On average, slightly more than two ANC guerrillas were killed or captured by security forces for every three of the 634 guerrilla attacks between 1976 and 1986 (almost all of which were carried out by the ANC),&quot; the study notes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Since many, perhaps most, MK attacks can be classified as modest in their dimensions, this casualty rate indicates a high cost for what were minimal operational rewards.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrell says that in 1985 and 1986 there was a shift away from sabotage operations aimed at industrial installations with an increased number of attacks being carried out on security forces and civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite some dramatic incidents -- including bomb blasts in Pretoria and Amanzimtoti and attacks on Sasol and Koeberg -- MK remained largely ineffectual at a military level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The statistics indicate that on average between 1976 and 1986, for every three insurgent attacks, which were usually modest sabotage actions, security forces killed or captured two ANC guerrillas, recovered seven insurgent hand grenades, captured three firearms and neutralised more than two limpet mines.&quot; These statistics, he says, correlate with the &quot;frustrations and disappointments&quot; described by ANC strategists and members interviewed for the thesis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Barrell also points out that MK guerrillas had little success in linking up with and getting support from ANC political structures inside the country, with the result that short-term cross- border incursions remained the norm, while guerrillas who successfully infiltrated into the country generally had short periods of survival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A deeply damaging consequence of this was that the ANC was never able to achieve its objective that political and military structures should cooperate closely -- and give direction to the possibilities for popular insurrection that the organisation believed were developing in the townships in the 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The failure of its armed struggle to make real military progress defined almost all strategic questions the ANC asked itself between 1976 and 1986.  Likewise, almost all the ANC's decisions to change operational strategy and structures between 1976 and 1986 were designed to remedy this failure. And a high proportion of these decisions were never implemented.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Non-implementation was most evident in cases where it was decided that political and military structures should cooperate more closely in the hope of creating the kind of organised domestic political base in which armed combatants might reasonably hope to survive. Personal and departmental rivalries and vanities persistently undermined these decisions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Until about 1988, &quot;attempts to develop an internal underground leadership of seniority and genuine organisational power were repeatedly deferred or frustrated ... The result was that the ANC underground remained fractured between political and military components, each comprising units that were usually isolated from each other; the only link these units often had with the 'ANC' was with the ANC abroad, which was unable to maintain a dynamic relationship with them or provide them with tactical guidance in what was, certainly from 1984, a fast- moving situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This meant a further failure. The ANC was unable to control or direct insurrectionary activities carried out by informal armed groups that began operating quite spontaneously in the townships under the banner of the ANC and the United Democratic Front in the 1980s -- called MK auxiliaries and then &quot;grenade squads&quot; by the movement's leadership. &quot;Various ANC leaders,&quot; he says, &quot;fought to control it (armed action by informal units operating in the townships) while it appeared to be succeeding and denied any link with it when it failed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The thesis says the ANC leadership became obsessed with the idea that apartheid could only be ended by popular armed struggle -- &quot;a kind of Sisyphian task to which all else had to be subject&quot; -- and that this mindset was cemented by the massive levels of violence unleashed by the security forces against the organisation and its members in the 1970s and 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Yet by the mid-1980s the evidence strongly suggested that not only was armed struggle a failure at a military level but that popular political mobilisation, including the activities of the militant trade unions, provided a more serious challenge to the state than the ANC's military campaign. Much of this political mobilisation and organisation had been initiated or conducted autonomously of the ANC,&quot; says Barrell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The political dividend the ANC derived from armed struggle made the resources spent on it and lives lost in it worthwhile in the ANC's calculations. Indeed, the heavier the ANC's losses, the higher that return often was: the more MK cadres being buried or marching off to jail, the greater the evidence that the ANC had dared to struggle against a brutal, powerful and internationally infamous enemy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, says Barrell, involved a tragic irony. Apartheid was most effectively challenged by political struggles on the part of ordinary civilians inside the country rather than by the armed actions that dominated the ANC's tactics in the 1970s and 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Therein,&quot; says Barrell &quot;lies the explanation for the paradox of the ANC's trajectory: how it found its success in failure.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A single incident is missing from the ANC's submission to the truth commission and it speaks volumes about why both the African National Congress and the National Party this week failed, essentially, to take moral responsibility for the abuses committed by their members in the apartheid years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In July 1988 a car bomb exploded outside Ellis Park killing two civilians and injuring 38. The ANC has never denied responsibility for this attack and, because of the sophisticated technology involved, it would have been carried out by the organisation's Special Operations group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This unit of Umkhonto weSizwe was, according to the ANC's submission, formed with the mandate of undertaking high profile attacks on targets such as the Sasolburg oil refinery, Koeberg and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Voortrekkerhoogte -- and it reported via a separate chain of command directly to ANC president Oliver Tambo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that chain of command could, according to research published by the Institute of Defence Studies, have included at least two people who now sit in the Government of National Unity: Defence Minister Joe Modise and his deputy Ronnie Kasrils -- senior officials in the Umkhonto weSizwe hierarchy at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy President Thabo Mbeki indicated ANC military leaders would provide the commission with information on the lines of command governing former MK operatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And he said the ANC was encouraging individuals to seek amnesty where necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amnesty committee can, if requested, hear submissions in camera.  Publication of the details of the application will only be made if amnesty is granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If everyone who was compromised by past abuse came clean at the truth commission -- which, at least in the initial arguments for the establishment of the organisation, was seen as a prerequisite for coming to terms with the past -- some members of the Cabinet would have to apply for amnesty without the prospect of automatically receiving this.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little doubt that the ANC's report to the truth commission is, both in its moral and academic integrity, far superior to that of the NP. It is a thorough 90-page document which effectively summarises the history of those turbulent years under apartheid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It also includes a thick set of appendices -- one of which comes refreshingly close to the kind of frankness that was expected of the political parties appearing at the truth commission: 34 names of people who were executed in the ANC's camps after being &quot;found guilty&quot; of being spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tom Lodge, politics professor at the University of the Witwatersrand, sums up the key difference between the ANC's conduct and that of the NP and its supporters during the apartheid period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In comparative terms -- with reference to the general conduct of liberation wars in other parts of the world -- the ANC fought a clean war.  And if armed rebellions are justifiable, the ANC's decision to take up arms was certainly defensible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is little doubt that most ANC members, including key leadership figures, would pass the proportionality test -- that the extent of violence for political purposes was in proportion to the objective of the act -- which the truth commission must take into account before granting amnesty to perpetrators of human rights abuse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead of using this ethical, and strategic, high ground to produce a frankness that was expected of the truth process, Lodge says the document &quot; takes such pains to 'contextualise' every abuse and violation of human rights committed by the organisation -- that at times this effort comes close to excusing the inexcusable. As a consequence the moral weight of this document is diminished.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NP's 35-pager contains none of the complex mix of honesty and defensiveness that defines the ANC report. Reading like a matric history textbook written in the 1980s, it is devoted to a justification of the former government's actions in terms of the historical context for apartheid -- with former state president FW de Klerk's apology for human rights abuse at the time limited to a small paragraph on page 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">De Klerk's defining quote came early on: &quot;In dealing with the unconventional strategies from the side of the government, I want to make it clear from the outset that, within my knowledge and experience, they never included the authorisation of assassination, murder, torture, rape, assault or the like... The above statement is also a reflection of the viewpoint of my colleagues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He made no mention of the suffering and loss of people who were resettled by apartheid, nor those who were detained, banished or exiled. The explanation for apartheid was kept vague: broad sweeps of policy which appeared to create a framework for executive decision-making.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was as though De Klerk had surrendered his adult powers of judgment to the forces of time and history: &quot;We are all the children of our times, and the product of the cultural and political circumstances into which we were born and with which we grew up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Jannie Gagiano, political scientist at the University of Stellenbosch, says it was not possible for the members of the former government's executive not to know what was going on at the time. &quot;(Frederik) van Zyl Slabbert, the leader of the then opposition, used to tell me stories when he was in Parliament, stories which were floating around. If somebody like Van Zyl Slabbert knew what was happening in Mozambique and Angola, why did the minister of defence not know? People like him and De Klerk must have known what was going on ... and if you knew you can hardly say I did not give instructions ... It is like when Uli Schmidt is known to kick in the scrum but is still considered a bit of a hero and you hear them saying: 'You can't be an angel if you play in the scrum'.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Craig Williamson, former NP politician and senior adviser to the State Security Council, &quot;You can't just stand in a cesspool and wipe your hands quickly and say 'I am clean'. The NP does not yet understand what its policy does and what it did, and until it does, I can't see this thing coming to rest.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem for the truth commission is that the ANC, with its mix of honesty and omission, has missed the opportunity to provide the kind of collective catharsis that the organisation was expected to promote.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - After months of struggling to obtain sponsorship, five mountaineers and a cameraman left for Tibet on Sunday August 16, in South Africa's second-ever attempt at scaling Mount Everest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The battle for sponsorship followed the recent Sunday Times-sponsored expedition which saw bitter infighting between team members, rows over sponsorship and the death of team photographer, Bruce Herrod.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Sunday Times expedition, led by Ian Woodall, is believed to have cost about R1,5-million, according to a well-placed mountaineering source.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, the R220 000 budget for the latest team -- - Alex Harris (25), Anton Erasmus (27), Sean Disney (24), Robin Walshaw (25), Mark Campbell (26) and cameraman Sean Wisedale (30) -- is minuscule in comparison.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The cost of our entire expedition amounts to Ian Woodall's petty cash,&quot; said Harris, the team's leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There's been a lot of negative feeling from potential sponsors,&quot; co- climber Walshaw explained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Disney added: &quot;Sponsorship has been damaged by the previous expedition ...  I'm very bitter about it.&quot; He produced a file thick with rejections of sponsorship requests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Times editor Brian Pottinger turned down sponsorship, as did Independent Newspapers' deputy chief executive Ivan Fallon, who &quot;was fairly abusive on the phone&quot;, said Harris.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fallon says he was not abusive, but &quot;polite and firm. Anyway, it's absolute nonsense sponsoring people who have a dream of climbing Everest. They can go ahead and climb Everest if they want to, without my sponsorship,&quot; Fallon said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More than half their budget was sponsored, some of it scraped together from friends and relatives. The rest they provided personally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The expedition has been endorsed -- and partially sponsored -- by the Mountain Club of South Africa (MCSA), which distanced itself from Woodall's trip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MCSA president Andre Schoon said the negative impact of Woodall's expedition &quot;has been of great concern to the mountain club&quot;. However, he said the MCSA was &quot;extremely happy&quot; putting its weight behind Harris's team members, all of whom have considerable mountaineering experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Schoon said the tight budget would &quot;have a bearing on the expedition&quot;, and that they would have to cut back on assistance, such as yaks and porters in their assault on Everest from the North Ridge. He also said that &quot;a lightweight expedition&quot; such as this one was far more susceptible to bad weather than an expedition with more resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The North Ridge approach, from Tibet, is a technically more difficult and less popular route than the most commercialised South Col route from Nepal, taken by Woodall's team. Permits for the North Ridge approach are also considerably cheaper -- $5 500 for the group, as opposed to the $70 000 the Nepalese government charges for a team tackling the South Col approach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The climbers admitted last week that one of the reasons they'd chosen the North Ridge approach was because it was cheaper, but also because they thought it was safer -- if technically more difficult -- with less crevasses than South Col.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The biggest sponsorship the team raised was R50 000 in cash from camping outfitters ME Stores. Managing director Warwick Stevens said although it was unusual for his company to provide sponsorships of this sort, &quot;there needed to be a technical climbingteam to go again to Everest,&quot; to re-establish credibility in South African mountaineering. &quot;we were forced to be (the biggest sponsor). If we didn't step in, they didn't go.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Stevens conceded &quot;R50 000 for that sort of expedition is not a lot of money ... As a sponsor's view, this was a bargain.&quot; He said that his company was interested in developing mountaineering in South Africa, not in high- profile publicity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Their prize is to have a successful expedition, not necessarily to reach the summit. I think the guys sold themselves a little bit short,&quot; and that with more work they could have raised another R100 000, although not much more. &quot;I think the expectation of sponsorship is a little bit unreasonable.  Sponsorship is a business decision, not a donation,&quot; Stevens said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Keith Laing, financial director of CI Accessories, which sponsored the Harris trip tents and packs and gas appliances worth R21 000, sponsored the Woodall trip to a similar degree.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We got nothing out of it (the Woodall trip), so we were actually quite cynical about this one,&quot; Laing said. &quot;We've never yet seen a photograph of a Coleman stove on Everest, despite having sponsored it on the first one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Laing said his company was promised photographs and an assessment of its products from Woodall's team, but had not received either. The Sunday Times &quot; were in it as a marketing ploy&quot;, argued Laing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But most companies not directly involved in mountaineering and which were approached by the team were sceptical of the trip as a meaningful and unifying drive for the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Petroleum's public affairs liaison officer Peter Petersen said: &quot; Expeditions such as these are looked upon as a luxury. It's a nice-to-do thing, but won't help us here at all.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nedcor's assistant general manager Dr Ivan May said: &quot;We can't do everything. We've just sponsored the Olympic team ... Mountaineering is not a priority.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Andy Hackland, who was a member of Woodall's team, but resigned along with co-climbers Ed February and Andy de Klerk in protest at Woodall's leadership style, said the team's lack of sponsorship could actually be an advantage in the long run.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Small-scale is probably the better way to do it.&quot; Many mistakes are made in mountaineering, Hackland said, because climbers feel indebted to their sponsors and &quot;push the boat too far&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The team has not only struggled with sponsorship but has also battled to obtain media coverage. The climbers left Johannesburg International Airport following a press conference that was attended more by family than the media.  The climbers estimate the total coverage of their expedition thus far amounts to less than 15 newspaper articles, a few radio interviews and one television appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When they return, they'll be leading a development initiative to take four climbers from disadvantaged communities up Mount Cho Oyu, the world's sixth- highest mountain, also in the Himalayas. They're hoping this trip -- whether they reach the top or not -- will persuade potential sponsors to drop their scepticism about mountaineering and put financial muscle behind developing the sport in South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Voice of Soweto, a local community radio station, has linked up with British billionaire Richard Branson in a bid to obtain a FM licence in Gauteng.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application for a Gauteng radio licence is part of an effort to set up a radio station to be called Virgin 96 FM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio station's planned format is music and news bulletins, with the bulk of programmes aimed mainly at the youth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director of the Virgin Group in London, Will Whitehorn, told the Mail &amp; Guardian that the &quot;principle shareholders&quot; in the Virgin application are Standard Bank and Soweto Megalomedia. Standard bank is in line to set up the financial backing if and when the application is approved and to take an equity stake in the station, says Whitehorn; while Soweto Megalomedia is the black consortium which was established to make the application to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitehorn pointed out that the chief executive officer of Voice of Soweto, Mpumi Dakile, is the principle shareholder in the consortium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dakile, acting representative for the Megalomedia consortium, said in a statement earlier this week that the licence application was done in &quot; partnership with Virgin and South African financiers&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of the financiers is believed to be Richemont, the international business arm of the Rembrandt Group -- owned by the Anton Rupert family empire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whitehorn confirmed that Richemont has approached Virgin for a stake in the radio station, but says &quot;everything is still up in the air&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Local Rembrandt representative Hans Knoetze denied that Rembrandt was involved in the licence application, adding that he is &quot;unable to talk on behalf of Richemont&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rembrandt is the fourth-largest group of companies in South Africa after Anglo American, Sanlam and SA Mutual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Richemont owns 50% of Nethold, a multi-million rand pay and satellite television operation that functions in the Benelux, Nordich and Mediterranean countries, Central Europe and the Middle East.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Based in Switzerland, Richemont's main operations outside of media include the Vendome luxury group and the Rothmans International cigarette group whose brands include Rothmans, Peter Stuyvesant, Dunhill and Craven A.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ruperts own a 27,2% stake in Perskor (owner of The Citizen), which owns a 15,4% stake in M-Net.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If the Ruperts are linking up with Branson in an indirect manner, they will make a formidable team, says one industry source, while another says he is fearful that this type of partnership -- a new foreign kid on the block (Virgin) teaming up with old local money (Rembrandt) -- will sideline the real issue of black empowerment and diversity in the media, especially since both Virgin and Rembrandt, either directly or indirectly have other media interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin has several media interests in Britain including a medium-sized book company which publishes entertainment, rock and television books, among others. &quot;We have published several well-known biographies such as the Ted Turner biography, one on the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley and so on,&quot; Whitehorn says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin is also involved in post-television production, providing facilities for editing and interactive programming. It owns the largest commercial radio station in Britain on both AM and FM frequencies. The AM frequency is national, with a FM frequency for the south-east of England. Whitehorn says the total listenership is about 4,5- million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He refused to comment on how much money Branson will be ploughing into the South African radio station, but said Virgin Radio International (the company set up for all international interests outside of the UK) will have 20% of the equity -- the maximum shareholding allowed under South Africa's laws on foreign ownership in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Virgin application was one of 11 applications received by the IBA for three new FM and one AM licence in Gauteng. According to the IBA, nine applications were received for the Fm licence and two applications for the AM licence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Virgin's other sideline operations include a rival to Coca-Cola and selling Virgin Insurance and Pension Schemes. In October, Virgin Atlantic Airline will also begin a regular service from Johannesburg to London.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura - Perhaps the safest way to get around Burundi is to hitch a ride on a Primus beer lorry. While other vehicles run the gauntlet of Hutu rebels, and the army moves with trepidation in many rural areas, there is no part of the country that central Africa's best-loved beer cannot reach. And it does so unscathed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Brarudi brewery, bottler of Primus, is among the most valuable and closely guarded buildings in Bujumbura. Soldiers are on hand outside its barbed- wire-topped walls to ensure the rebels don't hit where it hurts -- and to claim a few bottles of beer for their effort.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government is protecting a precious source of social stability -- if the Primus runs out, Burundians will know the country is collapsing. And in three years of civil conflict, political chaos and economic decline, the brewery has become the bedrock of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The war and falling prices have driven the coffee industry into the ground.  Foreign aid paid a good chunk of the government's salaries until the United States and European countries cut it off in April. The sanctions imposed by Burundi's neighbours after the military coup a fortnight ago are preventing exports. So it is left to the brewery to drip-feed the government's coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Last year beer taxes were the single largest source of revenue. This year they may account for up to half the government's income. But the brewery and the government are not the only ones taking a slice of the pie. Lorries laden with Primus move freely because Hutu rebels exact their own &quot;tax&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While coffee convoys and other goods are a favoured target for the insurgents, it may take no more than a crate or two of beer for the armed men at the roadside to wave the Primus lorry on. Hauliers pay the biggest contributions -- otherwise known as protection money -- to the most organised of the rebel groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is smart politics by the rebels. Hitting tea and coffee plantations is one thing. But who wants to be responsible for cutting off the beer supply?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Possibly the Dutch. The Brarudi brewery is 60% owned by Heineken, creating some dissent in the Netherlands, where the company is accused of helping to perpetuate Tutsi power and the slaughter of Hutu civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brewery's Belgian manager &quot;went on holiday&quot; the night before the coup, leaving orders forbidding the Burundian staff to talk publicly about the brewery's operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Besides Primus, Brarudi brews Amstel, holds the Coca-Cola concession and bottles water. But at the end of a hard day, most Burundians reach for a Primus. From early morning government soldiers can be seen swigging from the three free bottles they receive each day. Their officers insist it has no impact on their fighting abilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the evidence from Rwanda suggests that it adds to their brutality. Many of those who contributed to Rwanda's genocide could be seen drinking a Primus between killings. As Rwanda's largely Hutu army retreated before the Tutsi rebel onslaught, the soldiers abandoned weaponry to the enemy in favour of hauling crates of beer on to their vehicles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those were good times for Burundi's brewery. Rwanda's war had shut down its own beer production, leaving an open and thirsty market. But now the Burundians have their own conflict, and the pressure of regional sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda are enforcing a blockade which has halted flights, sealed borders and cut fuel deliveries. The price of imports rises daily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The brewery says it is more than prepared for siege. It has stockpiled ingredients and learned in the past three years how to survive political strikes, intimidation of workers, power cuts, water shortages and death threats against the management.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The meandering road leading to the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) Midrand headquarters has changed little from the late 1980s. It is possibly the only thing that has remained the same about the bank as it faces the millennium with a new direction and mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This year has been characterised by instability, in part caused by the resignation of Andre le Grange as chief executive in February. Div Botha and Nick Christodoulou held the fort until June before the appointment of the present incumbent, Dr Ian Goldin.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the operational side, the bank has had to concentrate on two main issues: to take the transformation process forward and maintain existing disbursements and project activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Goldin said the latter was influenced by the knowledge that infrastructure would be the main thrust of the bank's future activities, while projects in other sectors were being gradually phased out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The extent and timing of this phasing out have been guided by the knowledge that the bank would probably have to perform a significant warehousing function for projects in rural, small business and human resource development previously approved and funded. This would continue until new institutions were in place to take over these functions, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu and Goldin are confident the bank will continue its near-perfect cost recovery record even though the bulk of its future clients will now be local authorities. This despite reports that local authorities in six provinces are owed a staggering R3-billion for services by their residents. Gauteng local authorities alone are owed R2,415-billion, according to Constitutional Affairs minister Valli Moosa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The availability of grant funding from the government and other donors for capacity-building of local authorities will contribute to developing the financial sustainability of the new borrowers,&quot; said Nkuhlu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Established in 1983 by the government as a funding conduit to develop &quot;the constellation of Southern African states&quot; (including the &quot;independent&quot; homelands) and funded by the government to the hilt (a total of R3,7-billion has been pumped into the DBSA to date), the bank grew into a top-heavy structure with layer-upon-layer of senior management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was headed by a 15-member council of governors drawn from the ranks of homeland and senior government functionaries. A 10-member board of directors, complemented by eight alternate directors as well as an executive management team, took charge of the bank, which six years after its inception had a staff of 682.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now, having shed over 150 staff since 1989, a few senior managers are currently negotiating severance pay deals. According to Goldin, &quot;considerable unhappiness existed as a consequence of the perception that decision-making was concentrated in the hands of a few people&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Goldin: &quot;It was soon realised that the internal transformation of the organisation would require an approach in which the bank had not been greatly successful in the past --that is, offering staff a meaningful opportunity for participation in the process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These and several other cutting-edge changes follow the report by a finance ministry transformation team, appointed last May, which tabled a range of recommendations to alter the fabric of the bank and to bring its structure and purpose in line with the overall democratic changes in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkuhlu says there is now broad agreement on the bank's new mandate, which is infrastructure development. Another main change has been the reduction of state funding, which means the bank has had to both increase borrowings and cut its capital funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, disbursements in development loans and grants have risen by 15, 7 % to a record R1,328- billion; there is an additional R2,621-billion in approved, but undisbursed loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A sharp contrast can be drawn against total disbursements of R473-million five years ago, with R60-million paid out for infrastructure development, and average total disbursements of R1-billion a year for 1988, 1989 and 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mandla Gantsho, finance general manager, describes the role of the bank then as &quot;trying to be all things to all people&quot; by financing projects for a wide array of needs from education to small business, roads and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All this came about to ensure that the apartheid policy and ideology could be advanced through this funding processes,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another major departure is the bank's new role in mobilising private sector investment in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">infrastructure. So far this year, R770,5-million has been raised from the private sector, bringing about a new form of private and public sector partnership, with the bank serving as a catalyst for linking the finance sources and the projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nkuhlu notes that political change has opened up international funding opportunities. He argues that the country's internal resources alone cannot cope with the funding needs of the Reconstruction and Development Programme, the new macro-economic growth plan, job creation, a national crime prevention plan, and a system of welfare security nets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is therefore encouraging that other countries and overseas institutions have offered an initial package of concessional and grant funding, technical assistance and export credits to a total value of R12,5-billion,&quot; said Nkuhlu.  He, however, stressed that these will be accepted with extreme caution, taking into account risks associated with foreign borrowing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is indeed a meandering road to travel, but at least the road ahead seems much clearer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Dr Jan Visser talks about why management and unions must co- operate if South Africa is to boost productivity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's productivity is notoriously poor by international standards - - the latest World Competitiveness Report puts us second-last out of 48countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Not a good record, agrees Dr Jan Visser, executive director of the National Productivity Institute (NPI), which is hosting the World Productivity Assembly next month. &quot;But productivity is an organisational issue rather than a national norm.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;One of the biggest problems in terms of raising productivity in this country is the lack of co- operation between management and unions. They tend to fight, not to support each other. Strike negotiations are a case in point - - a perfect example of how not to work together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;For too long, organisations have set their sights on creating profits for shareholders, as opposed to creating wealth that can be shared around more equitably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The aim now should be not how to cut down on the input and still increase the output, but how to get the most from your throughput. Good resources have to be used to their maximum potential, and that includes labour. But management, too often, lacks the skills and leadership to get the most out of the workforce in the most productive way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The NPI advises between 500 and 600 companies a year on enhancing productivity -- the big issue at the moment being improving communication channels within companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is a great need for know-how at a management level, but we can't just apply foreign techniques and experience willy-nilly. Our situation is quite different to that of the East Asian countries, for example. One fundamental principle is inherent in all the debates over raising productivity: unless we work together towards a common goal and a common vision, we will not succeed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That's where the Asians got it right. Management offered a quid pro quo: workers would keep their jobs if productivity was increased. Thus, greater input translated into greater output; their exports boomed, and their standard of living improved.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Foreign direct investment is the most effective way of transferring the skills South Africa needs, but so far that bricks and mortar capital has been outgunned by portfolio buying, as reflected in the balance of payments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One of our biggest economic problems, the current account deficit has been in the red for the past seven consecutive quarters. The answer is to export more, says Visser. Competing on the international stage also means becoming more capital-intensive: &quot;We can't fight the world with last year's production methods.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But this raises the question of capital versus labour. With such a massive unemployment rate, can we really afford to become capital-intensive?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Our first priority is to get the economy growing, then jobs will follow.  Concentrating on labour- intensive production methods could be counter- productive as we become increasingly uncompetitive on international markets.  But in addition, companies choose the capital-intensive route because they feel they are being held to ransom by the unions. They deliberately steer away from using more labour if they feel they cannot trust the workers to co- operate.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Which brings us back to Visser's original argument -- the lack of co- operation between management and labour: &quot;The whole industrial relations debate is focused on negotiating at a national level, but productivity takes place at an individual, organisational level. Companies are not skilled enough at bargaining, so they take the easier option of adopting national measures. This is counter- productive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And also helps to explain why the few tentative steps taken by unions and management to set pay increases in line with productivity targets have failed to lead anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;So far,&quot; says Visser, &quot;there has been a lot of talk and very little action.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But South Africa is learning, with the help of international competition. &quot; We fell behind somewhat during the period of isolation,&quot; says Visser, &quot;but already, managers are taking greater interest in overseas developments and applying them locally, albeit slowly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He hopes the World Productivity Assembly on September 3 to 4 will help to foster that enthusiasm: &quot;It all boils down to education and training, one of South Africa's biggest downfalls. In addition, we lack 'productivity champions' -- people at the top who orchestrate change and so increase productivity from the bottom up.&quot; Local and foreign specialists will be on hand to provide a lift.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Chairman of the Association of Mortgage Lenders, Duncan Reekie, says rising interest rates and growing unemployment are the main reasons why the banks have not financed as many houses as expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reekie's response follows widespread criticism levelled against the government for failing to deliver on its promises for houses. &quot;The view of the banks is that demand for credit has been weak owing to the prevailing economic conditions. High interest rates impact unfavourably on housing demand by way of affordability and the lack of growth in the economy has curtailed the pool of new potential homeowners with a stable income required to service a mortgage loan,&quot; he says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A target of 50 000 was set by the banks and the government for the period June 1 1995 to May 31 1996 after the Mortgage Indemnity Fund (MIF) was established, but the banks approved only 35 000 loans worth R2,7-billion. At the same time, the real goal of the MIF was to help people earning less than R3 500 a month and only 19 000 of these loans with a total value of R765- million were granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, Reekie was talking at the regional symposium hosted by the Housing Ministry at Interbuild 96 in Johannesburg where representatives of housing ministries from neighbouring states reported increases in housing delivery in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The South African, Namibian, Zimbabwean, Botswanan and Swaziland housing ministries described various mechanisms and plans aimed at devising alternative funding systems to house the more than 70% of their populations that are homeless on the sub-continent who cannot be financed by the banks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">From Namibia, Housing director general Karl Gowaseb</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said his country had created a community-based scheme which is supported by the government to help low income earners to build houses and already 4 500 have been built to address the 40 000 backlog in his country.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Over R100-million in assets is up for grabs as the government decides the fate of funds accumulated by the Wool Board, which is due to merge with the National Wool Growers Association (NWGA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister of Land Affairs and Agriculture Derek Hanekom has decided to postpone the planned merger until a special two-man investigative committee can fully evaluate the situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says Wool Board chief executive officer Johan Gieselbach: &quot;The best way to handle the money is for the two bodies to join immediately.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The present scheme, promulgated in Government Notice No. R 1274 in July 1993, in terms of the Marketing Act No. 59 of 1968, states that should the Wool Board be dissolved, its assets would be distributed mainly to all wool producers who paid levies towards it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Wool Board, with the NWGA, decided this was not the best route for the industry and so formulated a trust as announced in the Government Gazette during May this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The main objective of the trust, according to the gazette, was to manage the assets for the benefit of income beneficiaries such as organisations, associations, statutory bodies and institutions pursuing objectives under its set guidelines. Under these specifications, should the Wool Board be dissolved the assets would go into the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But industry watchers argue that the trust was really set up to stop wool producers from getting their hands on the money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Presently the R100-million, an accumulation of levies on wool producers and funds derived from investments, is generating income for the Wool Board as specified by the Marketing Act, which is soon to be amended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The NWGA wants to have its cake and eat it too; they want the minister to continue instituting levies, but don't want him to intervene in management matters,&quot; said Tracy Simbi, adviser to Hanekom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the head of the NGWA, Theums Botha, it is simply trying to survive. &quot;The government was not pleased with the idea of separate boards and eventually both boards would disappear in a couple of years,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botha indicated the new Marketing Act, scheduled to go through parliament next month, would bring about &quot;restructuring of both the Wool Board and the NWGA&quot;. The merger between the two boards was scheduled to take place on October 1 this year, &quot;but then the minister intervened&quot;.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The government dug in its heels this week in the face of mounting criticism about its economic policies and refused to give firm timetables for the key contentious issues of privatisation and the lifting of exchange controls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite tough questioning from local and international media during the special parliamentary briefing week, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin insisted the &quot;basic economic fundamentals are sound&quot; to meet the targets of 6% growth and a deficit of 3% by the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Standing in for Public Enterprises Minister Stella Sigcau, Erwin said the government did not plan to produce timetables on what state enterprises it planned to privatise. Each institution was being dealt with on a case-by-case basis and finalisation depended on negotiations with the unions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel, meanwhile, was happy with the way the economy was going: &quot;By all accounts, the basic economic fundamentals are sound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All indications are that we remain on track for 3% growth this year.  Although there has been a slowdown in manufacturing we have a very buoyant agricultural sector and non-gold mining sector.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Even gold is making a contribution to the domestic economy because of the rand gold earnings. So on expected growth, we are on target. As the figures of both the Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index show, it is also very true to say that inflation is fairly firmly under control, notwithstanding the depreciation of the rand.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But, no matter how sound the fundamentals, the markets remain jittery about the fact that the government is not demonstrating its confidence by moving fast on exchange controls and privatisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel countered this by saying the International Monetary Fund supported the gradualist approach &quot;and they draw on a range of international experience&quot; .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He agreed that the government faced a &quot;perceptual problem&quot;, but he did not believe it should deal with this &quot;by changing decisions week by week. You can only deal with perceptual issues by retaining a focus on the long view.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That meant getting the right systems and structures in place to ensure lean and efficient government, to correct structural weaknesses such as inefficient and uncompetitive industries and create market friendly policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whether this approach is right or not remains a moot point, but although it might be slow and ponderous, it is gradually showing results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus also outlined some of the systems being put in place. She said the budget council and the national budget committee had just completed two weeks of presentations and had agreed to prepare budgets for 1997/98 in line with the 4% deficit target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'The budget committee will take its initial recommendations to the Cabinet in September, while the next budget council meeting in October will consolidate the national and provincial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recommendations,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This process had highlighted several issues. Reprioritisation within budgets still needed more attention while it was clear that the Constitution had created new bodies, commissions and obligations that needed funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We urgently recommend that this be costed and an approach taken that fits in with what we can afford,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the same time, white papers developed by various departments &quot;tend towards policies that do not take sufficient account of the resources available&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The finance department was thus re-organising itself, setting up a Budget Office with a unit responsible for medium-term expenditure planning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We plan to provide at least a three-year Budget horizon so that we move away from year-on-year budgeting without a vision of where our spending priorities will be,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The dispute over privatisation has shifted to the Department of Constitutional Development, with labour determined to block the contracting-out of basic municipal services to large multinational companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sensitive discussions are taking place between the department, provincial and national politicians, the South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) and representatives of the multinationals. Lyonnaise des Eaux -- the largest multinational -- has already secured a handful of water delivery contracts with municipalities in Kwazulu-Natal, the Eastern and Western Cape. These include Queenstown, Stutterheim and Khayelitsha.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The French-based international company, with an R85- billion annual turnover, is in partnership with the South African-based Group Five, and has contracts all over the developing world, specialising in the delivery of water and water-based sanitation systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lyonnaise des Eaux representative Jean-Claude Ambert said this week that the South African venture, Lyonnaise Water Southern Africa, could provide services at a time when many local governments are in disarray and not functioning efficiently as a result of the merging of previously racially separated authorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We can facilitate a quicker response to the expectations of people and we can bring finance for investment in infrastructure needed for the delivery of services, if necessary. For example, in Buenos Aires we invested $4-billion in infrastructure, bringing money to projects that do not usually attract investors,&quot; said Ambert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His company is pushing for lengthy contracts that would provide &quot;delegated management&quot; of water delivery and sanitation systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We have to look at about 25 years as we would be putting infrastructure in place and we need to get some revenue and reward for that venture.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Department of Constitutional Development director general Andrew Boraine said it was approaching proposals cautiously. However, he said Minmec -- the forum of officials and political decision-makers involved in local government development -- would be discussing draft guidelines to regulate such contracts on September 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine said the government would insist on a number of pilot projects before encouraging wholesale outsourcing of delivery, and these should be monitored for a year, hopefully with labour providing their own experts to evaluate the project's success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he sees such contracts as part of the public-private partnership that lies at the heart of the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Framework, which the government hopes will put service delivery back on track.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Boraine and his department are in a particularly tight corner, because they cannot instruct municipalities one way or the other, as local government is, at this stage, a provincial function and municipalities have a degree of financial autonomy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the debate on privatisation has become such a hot potato on a national level, that it is difficult to introduce it in a neutral environment for adaptation at local level. And while the national debate rages, delivery problems on the ground in many areas, particularly the poorer ones, are in crisis, and the Masakhane campaign fails to stimulate payment of rates and taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the secretary general of Samwu, Roger Ronalds, said labour was totally opposed to the concept of handing over service delivery to business concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are opposed to the ideology underpinning the plan in the first place ...  we are opposed to privatisation. It removes accountability and democratic control of services by handing them over to private companies,&quot; he said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronalds said the boasts made by the companies that they bring with them finance for investment and better conditions for workers was untrue and quoted one -- a water purification firm -- as an example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">'This firm delivers water and the condition of the workers has deteriorated under them, nor have they followed up promises of training and promotion.  Workers are earning between R600 and R1 500 gross a month, whereas the minimum wage in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">municipalities in Cape Town, for example, is R1 600.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ronalds believes the solution lies in reorganising the municipal workforce and operations from within, but still tackling delivery as an agent of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">All parties are committed to continuing discussions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - A clash between old- and new-guard lawyers is set to hang over the latest round of the anti-trust legislation debate, which will soon be taken on by the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) - - and it appears the old guard has the upper hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although it is almost two years since the government signalled its intention to tighten South Africa's flaccid competition legislation, the combination of putting the discussion before Nedlac and the divergent stances of the men charged with drawing up new legislation should rule out a quick settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pierre Brooks, long-time chairman of the Competition Board, is still involved in shaping new legislation, despite coming up against former trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel, who spiked Brooks's first draft of the Competition Bill earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Manuel reportedly almost fired Brooks for taking an overly lenient approach that was at odds with government thinking. But until now the details of what Brooks suggested have never been disclosed as the Bill itself was kept secret.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an accompanying memorandum to the Bill, Brooks says: &quot;The draft Bill does not provide for the coercive dissolution of conglomerates. (This process) is fraught with pitfalls and should preferably be done on a voluntary basis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He adds: &quot;One of the intended consequences of this approach is to enhance competition between the conglomerates.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One lawyer described this statement as &quot;naive&quot;; another said it appeared Brooks felt the only players in the South African economy were conglomerates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When trade and industry minister Alec Erwin took over he kept Brooks on after the Cabinet shake-up in April -- a move that has puzzled some in progressive legal circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both Brooks and Willem Pretorius, a Cape Town advocate who helped pen the first draft, were then charged with taking the debate back to square one by compiling a discussion document on all the options open to the government -- including more severe measures, such as provisions for actively splitting up conglomerates, which were absent from the ditched first draft. It is this discussion document that will go to Nedlac in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Brooks has repeatedly called for more powers -- the board has had few successful prosecutions -- some believe it is inappropriate for him to be involved in the wholesale revamp of legislation that is required as he has nailed his colours so firmly to the mast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Erwin appointed Professor Dennis Davis to help out, in an apparent bid to bring new blood into the debate. However, it is understood Davis has had nothing to do with compiling the Nedlac document, although he has seen it. While it is only a discussion document, some observers suspect Davis has been sidelined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is noteworthy that Erwin wants the issue to be taken up at Nedlac, where business will have a chance to shoot down ideas it does not like. Questions have been asked as to why the government's macro-economic framework policy document should leapfrog Nedlac -- to avoid a showdown with the unions -- whereas the framework for competition legislation will now be exposed to Anglo American (and other big business) firepower in the tripartite chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Brooks's heavy role under Erwin is understood to have brought Erwin into conflict with some in the government alliance who are keen for swift implementation of tightened anti-trust legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nedlac discussion document examines the approach taken in the United States, which bars executives from Anglo American and De Beers from its shores because of the De Beers diamond cartel. The US legislation includes measures to break up conglomerates. Although US companies face criminal liability and attacks from the state and other companies if they fall foul of the legislation, there are only a couple of cases of conglomerates actually being split up. Some local lawyers argue that merely having stringent legislation on the statute books sends out the right signal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most European jurisdictions do not allow for the active break-up of conglomerates. Instead they examine abuses of dominant positions and then impose fines or set aside agreements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Europe, therefore, South African Breweries would not be torpedoed simply because it is a monopoly -- or &quot;temporary sole supplier&quot; as it once called itself. Instead, its behaviour in the market would be examined before any action was taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Many European countries' competition laws are, however, focused on forging a common market, underpinning the need for South Africa to concoct a hybrid model by borrowing from a variety of jurisdictions. South Africa is one of the most concentrated economies in the world -- conglomerates control more than 70% of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Whichever route the legislature takes, most local lawyers in the field feel it is crucial that it tap a wide range of legal minds and not rely exclusively on the lawyers who penned the spiked, lenient draft bill. Two years of political bickering, several committees, and one draft later the only winners are the conglomerates who could come under fire from a real Competition Act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg -</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Once hailed as a hero, former Chiefs star Shane MacGregor will be hoping to hand out a beating to his former team this weekend</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SOCCER: Andrew Muchineripi</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPERSPORT UNITED player-coach Shane MacGregor, the forward who once starred for Kaizer Chiefs, will plot the downfall of his former club at the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams clash in an intriguing Coca-Cola Cup quarter-final at the Rand Stadium on Saturday with the Amakhosi seeking revenge over one of only two clubs to defeat them this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a wet, midweek night last March, Supersport upset the team in black and gold 2-1 through goals from midfielders Zane Alexander and captain Thomas Madigage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chiefs recovered smartly from the setback to win the Coca-Cola Challenge Cup and qualify for the African Champions' Cup, an option they may not take up because of the heavy costs involved.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacGregor was a Chiefs hero in the early 1990s, forming a lethal attacking partnership with Fani Madida, who plies his trade in the Turkish First Division these days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Now 33, MacGregor still laces his boots come match day, but when Nicky Shaw returns from injury later this year to partner new signing Marc Batchelor, the player capped once by Bafana Bafana is likely to take a back seat. The Coca-Cola Cup has a tradition of upsets with Amazulu, Umtata Bucks, QwaQwa Stars and Wits lifting the trophy against the odds since its inception five years ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Strange, then, that the quarter-final line-up this season should include traditional giants Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and Sundowns plus Supersport, Bush Bucks, Jomo Cosmos, Wits and QwaQwa Stars. Perhaps the quarter-finals will witness the slaying of the giants with Chiefs managing director Kaizer Motaung sending out smoke signals this week that suggest his side has little chance of progressing further. A white flag from Kaizer! Seems like a bit of psychological warfare is being staged here as the day Chiefs believe they have no chance of winning is the day darkness descends over Johannesburg at noon. Everyone has been hammering the Amakhosi, including officials, coaches, and the media, but two defeats in 23 matches is a record most of their rivals would gladly settle for.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What critics do say, with justification, is that Chiefs circa 1996 fall short of the standard set by the great teams of the 1980s and early 1990s.  Those were the golden days when the Amakhosi ruled supreme. Ace Ntsoelengoe, &quot; Teenage&quot; Dladla, Sylvester Kole, &quot;Ace&quot; Khuse, Doctor Khumalo, &quot;Shoes&quot; Moshoeu, Marks Maponyane. The list is endless. All skilful stars who drew the crowds like bees to honey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">National captain Neil Tovey is one link with the past although the legs do not cover the ground as quickly so he has swopped the trench warfare of midfield for a commanding view of the the battlefrom the rear. Thabang Lebese, Isaac &quot;Shakes&quot; Kungoane and David Modise are erratic crowd pleasers in midfield and up front Chiefs must long for another prolific partnership like Madida and MacGregor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First-choice forwards Pollen Ndlanya (suspended) and Mike Rapatsa (injured) are out of action, further weakening an area which is giving Chiefs' hierarchy sleepless nights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Supersport rank among the most ambitious and progressive clubs in the country with former Southampton and England winger Terry Paine MBE and MacGregor at the helm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The transformation of the club since the pay television station took charge less than two years ago has been remarkable even if much of the time has been spent in the Second Division.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pretoria City (as they were known then) won promotion last December and reached the Bob Save Super Bowl final before bowing to Cape Town Spurs after a five-goal thriller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That earned Supersport a place in the African Cup- winners' Cup (double winners Spurs were compelled to enter the more prestigious Champions' Cup) and they reached the quarter-finals before withdrawing this week. The club were unhappy about visiting Algeria, where more than 60 000 lives have been lost since civil war erupted in 1992 when the military-backed government cancelled legislative elections the Islamic fundamentalists were poised to win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MacGregor is not the only former Chiefs player in the squad, fullback Rudolf Seale spent many seasons racing down the left wing on behalf of the black and gold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seale is one of five players bought at the beginning of the year with forward Richard Peer coming from Witbank Aces, and defender Ronnie Zondi, midfielder Alexander and forward Roger Lupiya from Cape Town Spurs. Zambian Lupiya has not performed to expectations while the rest have fitted smoothly into a team whose target of a top-eight Premier Soccer League finish appears well within reach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Friday: Wits v QwaQwa Stars, Milpark 8pm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saturday: Supersport United v Kaizer Chiefs, Rand Stadium.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday: Sundowns v Jomo Cosmos, HM Pitje; Bush Bucks v Orlando Pirates, Boet Erasmus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - His feet speak as eloquently as those of Michael Johnson or Carl Lewis, and he has a treasure trove of gold and a world record to prove it. But Donovan Bailey's Olympic accomplishments in the 100m have been largely overshadowed in the hype surrounding Johnson's double and Lewis's ninth gold medal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Canada, however, 28-year-old Bailey's victory in Atlanta meant they could finally start blotting out the stain of Ben Johnson's disgrace when he tested positive after winning the 1988 Olympic gold medal. In the post-Ben era, Canadian fans had turned away from athletics.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey struggled for recognition at home even after winning the world championship last year. When he returned to Canada from Gothenburg, he and two British athletes who were visiting him tried to get a local night club to waive the $5 admission fee. &quot;I'm world champion,&quot; Bailey said. &quot;I don't care, it's still five dollars,&quot; the doorman replied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The corporate sponsors are now flocking to Bailey's door.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has signed endorsement deals worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from Adidas, Coca-Cola, Air Canada, Kellogg's and Helene Curtis, and his asking price on the European Grand Prix circuit has shot up to $50,000 per appearance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was top of the bill at Gateshead in England last weekend when a Great Britain team, captained by Linford Christie for the last time, took on a composite International Select team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey and Christie had a public falling out earlier this year when the Canadian accused the Briton of faking injury at the world championships. The two will never be as friendly as they were, but Bailey expresses sympathy for Christie's unlucky downfall in Atlanta when he was disqualified for two false starts. &quot;I felt so sorry for him,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it is hard to believe that even if Christie had not been thrown out of the Olympic final, he would have beaten Bailey, whose 9.84 seconds took one- hundredth of a second off the world record. &quot;That man was smokin',&quot; says Jon Drummond, one of America's top sprinters. &quot;Weren't nothing to stop Donovan that night. Nuff respect.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Olympic 100m champion usually can justifiably claim the title of the world's fastest man, but Johnson's performance in the 200m, when he covered the second 100m in an unbelievable 9.20 seconds, led Ato Boldon to say in Atlanta: &quot;Donovan Bailey might be the world record holder, but Michael is the fastest human alive.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If promoters can find the money, there is the possibility that Johnson and Bailey will split the difference and race over 150m. The world record for the distance of 14.8 seconds set by the Italian Pietro Mennea 13 years ago would surely be smashed. But by whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bailey, all legs and shoulders, joined by an absurdly narrow 28-inch waist, can appear cumbersome but has an incredible acceleration, while Johnson's unique upright style allows him to gobble up the ground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It would be a real clash of styles,&quot; said John Rose, an exercise physiologist from Arizona State University. &quot;When you start a race it's like you have a nine-volt battery. You have to use that battery wisely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bailey, because he is such a long-legged guy, takes longer to unfurl and get into optimal running position, whereas Johnson seems to be able to get into his running more quickly and maintain a high cruising rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As the 100m runner, Bailey may have more fast- twitch fibres -- but that in itself may not be enough.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Fast-twitch muscle fibres are to speed what hormones are to the sex drive - - the physical manifestation of a rather nebulous phenomenon. Fast- twitch fibres fire quickly, burning glycogen that's stored in the cells -- a fuel supply that is readily available, but finite. Slow-twitch fibres fire slowly but continuously, burning oxygen pumped in through the blood supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Though it is true that sprinters have a higher ratio of fast-twitch to slow-twitch fibres than the rest of us, the ratio is not an absolute indicator.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Sprinters also need a cardiovascular system that can pump enormous amounts of blood, and thus oxygen, into the legs quickly. Johnson, as a 400m runner, would probably have a higher cardiovascular system than Bailey, and would therefore win.&quot;'</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - It is of more than passing interest that Bruce Fordyce, the man head-hunted to become the first paid executive director of the Sports Trust, admits freely to coming from a &quot;priveleged, white background&quot; and attributes much of his sporting success to this factor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For Fordyce now has the task of administering the body -- a surprisingly easy mix of private enterprise, government and non-governmental sports asspociations -- which aims to bring a hint of that type of privilege to those who have never known it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And they have been doing just that: nearly R8- million has been dished out to deserving causes since the trust was formed 23 months ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is an amount that will no doubt increase,&quot; says Mthobi Tyamzashe, the director general of sport and recreation, and the man who chairs the trust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Bruce is one of the most acceptable sportsmen to the community at large,&quot; says Tyamzashe. This is true. Fordyce, the winner of nine Comrades Marathons, is more than just a pretty face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He is serious about trying to bring the benefits he enjoyed to others coming as he says from &quot;being a wimpish, skinny, long-haired hippy at school&quot; with no interest in sport, to becoming one of this country's pre-eminent sporting achievers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has a way to go in his new endeavour. Evidence of this was the fact that his new business cards arrived only minutes before he publicly accepted the job, and that he has to &quot;wind down&quot; some of his commitments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An erudite and reasoned thinker, he has access to both the kids at grassroots level through his fame as an athlete, and to the people who remain his priority in the new post, the decision-makers in commerce and industry the trust depends on for funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The trust has relied heavily on what Tobin Prior of Sun International refers to as the &quot;seed money&quot; from five major sponsors to get going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">FNB, M-Net, Sun International and the cricket and rugby unions between them stumped up R5-million which will be held in perpetuity, the interest being used for the day-to-day running of the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But there is much, as both Fordyce and Tyamzashe admit, still to be done.  Somehow, with the familiar diminutive figure at the head of the pack, you can count on it at least being a hard-fought contest.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - Movie myth has it that Wim Wenders broke the display window of a photographic shop and stole a wind-up Bolex to shoot his first film.  Stanley Kubrick, asked how to get into the movie industry, replied simply: &quot; Go out and make a film.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And that's exactly what young South African film-makers are doing. With witless audiences and financiers with a penchant for Leon Schuster, the South African feature-film industry is in a rut. But in its place, a host of short films are springing up, mostly made on a wish, a prayer and some donated or pilfered film stock.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Weekly Mail Short Film Competition has garnered over 300 entries in the last six years. Since 1993, M-Net has produced 11 short films in its New Directions series, and the SABC's Arts Unlimited is currently showcasing a series of short films, collectively titled Cutting Edge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The films have been co-produced by SABC3's commissioning editor of music and culture, Ansie Kamffer, and Cape Town-based company Big World, comprising film-makers Carsten Rasch and Steven Markovitz. It's encouraging that there's someone at the SABC who is championing short films: Kamffer commissioned last year's profiles of South African music personalities, and has initiated another series of short films this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Cutting Edge series, of which the first offering has already been screened, is a real mixed bag. First up was Corner Caffie, the debut film from casting director Timothy Greene. A fairly successful black comedy, it follows a petty squabble over 30 cents which grows into a farcical hostage situation, featuring a cross-section of new South African characters -- from the young black man on a university scholarship to the Greek behind the counter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latter is played with aplomb by real-life caf_ owner Tony Diamontopolous, who also supplied the location, the caf_ he owns in the Cape Town suburb of Observatory. The film is refreshingly to the point; Greene keeps the action flowing, with a keen eye on the irony of events, and avoids self- consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The same can't be said of the second film. Heartspace, directed by Carey Schonegevel, is a pretentious road movie that taps into our new national consciousness as it traces the journey from Cape Town to Johannesburg of three strangers: na-ve Cath, wiseguy Wandile and paranoid-schizo Pete. The script and performances are stilted, albeit beautifully shot by Mark Larkin in black and white. Still, if you're into nice images and non sequiturs, the film may appeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The third in the series, The Cage, suffers from clich_s of another kind.  Made in Los Angeles while director Warren Wilensky was studying and working there, it stars Marius Weyers and Sam Phillips, both exiles enjoying mini- careers in the US. The story follows two prisoners locked up in the same cell in 1990. You've seen it all before: the Afrikaner and the black man forge a friendship as they work together on the prison garden. It's all rather arch and theatrical, never mind politically obvious. But, despite the boring scripting, it's elegantly shot, well performed and, with its restricted setting, manages to evoke a real sense of production values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The final film, Eating Fish, is in production with Big World's Rasch at the helm. Based on a short story by Mike Nicol, it revolves around a teenage girl and her abductors -- a neurotic chain-smoker, a permanently sunglassed moll and a seasoned criminal. The makers might take some tips from Corner Caffie and keep up the pace, avoiding self-conscious narrative and stylistic contrivances. Just because a movie's not a feature film doesn't mean it has to be boring or pretentious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Heartspace will be screened on August 29 and The Cage on September 26, both during the Arts Unlimited slot at 10.15pm on SABC3. Eating Fish has yet to be scheduled</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The celebrated rebel of African cinema, Djibril Diop Mambety says it's the mission of film to make people think -- through laughter. He is an eccentric visionary, a poet and essayist who never panders to the commercial but rather explores the fantastic, always embroidering his sombre stories with a sense of irony, fantasy and wickedly low-key humour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was born in 1945 in Colobane, the suburb of Dakar, Senegal, which provides the setting for his second feature film, Hyenas, released at Ster- Moribo cinemas this week as part of a new commitment to screening films from Africa. In some ways, Hyenas is a curious choice to kick off the programme -- it's an audacious, stylised film that might be hard for South African cinema- goers to identify with. But on meeting Mambety, one is left with little doubt that the director will prove an inspiration to local film-makers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Speaking over a cup of coffee in a Johannesburg hotel, the lanky Mambety exudes the air of a shaman or a Zen master, his gravelly voice tinged with kindness. He is clearly an artist, and the symbolism and poetry of his films suggest that his stories emanate from deep within his soul.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hyenas, released here in conjunction with the Film Resource Unit, is based on Frederich Durrenmatt's play Der Besuch der Alten Dame -- a bitter tale of a wealthy, aged prostitute's revenge against the man who betrayed her. But, in Mambety's hands, the bleak and ominous tones of the original are tempered by wit, irony and a striking satire of neo-colonial Africa and the moral decay at the heart of consumer capitalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the film, Linguere Ramatou, the prostitute who returns to her village to exact her revenge, has miraculously become the richest woman in the world, &quot; as rich as the World Bank&quot;. She offers the impoverished village a trillion dollars if they will destroy Dramaan Drameh, the man who betrayed her and denied fathering their child. She says: &quot;The world made a whore of me; I want to turn the world into a whorehouse. You can't walk in the jungle with a ticket for the zoo. If you want to share the lion's feast, then you must be a lion yourself.&quot; And the villagers are seduced by the air conditioners, refrigerators and TV sets that she showers on them, and the small community becomes dependent on foreign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The film was years in the making. Mambety's idea stemmed from the real case of a prostitute who would treat the poor to a lavish meal every Friday in Dakar's harbour district. One week she failed to appear, and Mambety decided to invent a history for her. He only found a suitable ending after seeing Ingrid Bergman in the film version of Durrenmatt's play.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mambety recalls, in fantastical detail, travelling to Neuchatel to present the playwright with his idea -- walking up the curved road to the modest house at noon on a Sunday; the incessant barking of a red dog which was silenced only when he said: &quot;Bonjour&quot;. &quot;Durrenmatt was the same age as my mama and he regretted never going to black Africa,&quot; says Mambety. By three o'clock that day in 1985, he had been granted permission to film the adaptation. Unfortunately, the playwright didn't live to see it, but the film is dedicated to &quot;the great Frederich&quot;, and at its 1992 Cannes premi...re the director left an empty chair next to his.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Made 20 years earlier, his first film, Touki Bouki, deals with many of the same themes as Hyenas, says Mambety: &quot;The link between the two is money and treason.&quot; It follows two teenagers, Mory and his girlfriend Anta, who will go to any lengths to obtain the money they need to escape to Paris. The film's playfulness has been compared to that of Godard, and its imagery is both exhilarating and bitter-sweet. The hero, for example, rides a motorcycle with cattle horns mounted on its handlebars; and the constant refrain of the popular French music-hall number Paris, Paris, Paris underscores the absurdity of the situation. The inclusion of a gay character (whom the anti- hero fleeces of all possessions) is a first for African cinema.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mambety explains: &quot;Gays exist in African culture; despite what people say, it's not clandestine. Although Muslims and Christians might say it's no good, African religions say they've got a place. But for our conscience we say it's a Westernised phenomenon.&quot; The film became a landmark in African cinema precisely because it deals, without precedent, with issues of authentic values and post- independence with a unique sense of modernity and a poetic flair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Mambety is deferential about his status as a film-maker. &quot;I've done many things ... My life is more important than the cinema.&quot; In a Sight &amp; Sound interview, he said: &quot;Griot is the word for what I do and the role that the film-maker has in society. It is a Wolof word, which for me means more than a story-teller; griot is a messenger of one's time, a visionary and the creator of the future. The film- maker has much more to account for than an accountant or banker. He represents the collective consciousness of his people and he has to make it sublime and useful.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why did he choose film as a medium, as opposed to poetry, art or music?  Arms and fingers flailing, Mambety explains: &quot;Cinema is a combination of arts.  It creates a visual link between you and the other. You can be naked, and make the others naked. If you imagine you have your back to the sea, and in front of you there's a mirror, so you see yourself and behind you the sea, that's the three dimensions that is cinema.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He shows me the script for his next film, La Petite Vendeuse du Soleil, written like a poetic meditation, images next to snatches of dialogue. This is the expression of Mambety's subconscious which he will give birth to on celluloid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before parting, I ask Mambety how he can deal with such tragic social themes in such an ironic way, infusing his tales with such urbane wit. &quot;Life is serious, problems are serious, but if God looks at them from the skies he can laugh perhaps. God is never sad because he always knows the outcome of the drama. My mother said my name is Djibril -- that is Gabriel, so I'm like the angel who sits next to God. She taught me that I can laugh too.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Johannesburg - The Johannesburg art world is abuzz at the appointment of a member of the Gauteng legislature, Victor Modise, to the position of director of culture. The surprise appointment was made by the executive committee of the Greater Transitional Metropolitan Council (TMC) last week. As a result, Christopher Till, who has held the position since 1993, is jobless. But rumour has it that Till is not on his way out but up, heading for greener pastures on the National Arts Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What Modise's appointment means for the second Africus Biennale in 1997 -- given that Till has just appointed New York-based Nigerian curator, artist and editor, Okwui Enwezor, as artistic director -- is anyone's guess.  Widespread confusion is compounded by the fact that few in the art world know much about Modise, let alone what he has in mind for Johannesburg's cultural future.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Modise's appointment is one of 60 within the TMC and forms part of a restructuring process within local government. To some extent, it also mirrors the changes occurring on national level with the imminent departure of Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology Ben Ngubane. To date, no one has been named as a replacement for the outgoing IFP minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We believe names have been submitted by the IFP, but ultimately President Mandela will make the final decision,&quot; says Andile Xaba, communications spokesman for the Department of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology. &quot; Professor Ngubane has been recalled to the IFP and his replacement has very little to do with the department. It is a political issue.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conversely, Modise's appointment seems to have been based less on the vagaries of party politics than the strength of his cultural qualifications.  He was plucked from approximately 50 candidates applying for the job -- widely regarded as one of the most coveted and daunting in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We screened all the applicants very carefully,&quot; says the TMC's Danie Malan -- the man to whom Modise will ultimately report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Points were awarded according to a system worked out by our human resources staff, and a shortlist of candidates for the job was interviewed by a panel, before the executive committee made the final decision. The interviews were taped and documented and are available for public scrutiny.  The process was totally transparent.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Repeated attempts to contact Till for comment were unsuccessful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After meeting Modise, it is pretty clear why he got the job. He is a quietly charismatic man whose achievements in theatre and television should be listed in instalments. The progeny of Dorkay House, he began his involvement with activist theatre in the late 1960s and early 1970s, through the People's Experimental Theatre and playwright Sipho Sepamla.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I left South Africa in 1974,&quot; he recalls, &quot;after we had performed a play called Shanty written by a black consciousness playwright who belonged to Saso (the South African Students' Association). He was killed around that time, and we were subjected to constant police harassment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During his exile, spanning a period of 20 years, Modise spent time in Swaziland, Botswana and Tanzania before taking up a scholarship to study drama at Bristol University in the United Kingdom. He subsequently completed his master's degree in theatre arts at Leeds University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;That was the most exciting time for me,&quot; he says. &quot;It opened up a whole new world of theatrical experience because the courses were hands-on. They took me through the entire gamut of theatre, from management to writing to directing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But it was in London that Modise became actively involved in community theatre.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There were very few colleges offering courses in community arts theatre but I enrolled for one where I worked with centres such as the Greenwich People's Theatre and went into schools to take care of productions from beginning to end.&quot; He adds: &quot;Funding was scarce but everone made do with the minimum of resources. It was all about energy and commitment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These experiences -- coupled with previous first- hand brushes with poverty and discrimination -- have undoubtedly given Modise an empathy for the problems faced by disadvantaged communities. Also included in his skills data base is a six-month stint with Canada's Broadcasting Corporation, television work with independent film-makers in Wales, and -- after his return to South Africa in 1992 -- collaborating on the first 13 scripts of the popular local soap Generations. In short, Modise seems to be the kind of cultural beast Johannesburg needs: a multi- disciplinary African-Renaissance man with an internationalist eye, who remains in touch with the specific needs of his own constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is so much talent here, so much potential,&quot; he says. &quot;Yet for artists, dancers and performers from the townships, some things haven't changed since my departure 20 years ago.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To Modise, local government is the &quot;doer of things&quot;. &quot;I see my apppointment as similar to getting a job with a major corporation. As long as my performance is up to scratch, my position is secure.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to focusing on Johaneesburg's neglected metropolitan areas and promoting the development of the local craft sector, Modise aims to get actively involved in existing cultural projects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It's premature for me to disclose what I plan to do because I don't yet know my responsibilities concerning the Africus Biennale, Arts Alive and Newtown. But I plan to sit down with all the parties involved with an open mind and heart.&quot; He adds: &quot;I want to take this city forward without any form of mud-slinging. At the same time, while it is imperative for Johannesburg to become a viable international city, we musn't forget that we are in Africa, possessing a set of problems and priorities that are specific to the continent. Have we ever said to Africa: 'Here we are back with you. We want you to assist us in relocating ourselves and redefining our identity'?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;If we're going to compete with New York, we should do it not on their terms, but on our own.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DUBLIN -- South Africa's political settlement involved &quot;costly&quot; compromises, and a suspension of armed struggle was achieved only after negotiations began, Dr Alex Boraine, vice chairperson of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission told an Irish conference on reconciliation today (Monday).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing a summer school at the Glentree Centre for Reconciliation, near Dublin, Dr Boraine said that in South Africa &quot;it was through negotiation rather than prior to negotiation&quot; that the end of he ANC's armed struggle was achieved. Peace efforts in Northern Ireland have been dogged by disagreement between the British Government and Irish nationalists over similar issues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A verbatim extract from the relevant section of his address follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Many people both within South Africa and beyond its borders have described this transition as nothing short of a miracle. But the miracle didn't drop out of the sky. It had to be worked for, argued over and costly decisions involving compromise on both sides had to be made, the most important of which was that neither side could win through force of arms or violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The State could not suppress the resistance to its system of apartheid, nor could the liberation movements overthrow the State through force. The stalemate had to be resolved and the only way forward was negotiation politics. This is a fairly well-known process and I won't develop it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;However, one major point must be made: the State first demanded that liberation forces should surrender their arms and their arms caches and commit themselves to constitutional means of resolving t e conflict. The liberation forces, however, didn't trust the regime and refused to do this.  It was only when the negotiations started and people from both sides stared, and sometimes glared, at each other across a table that it was made possible by agree ent for the armed struggle of the ANC in particular to be suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In other words it was through negotiation rather than prior to negotiation that this decisive step was taken.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - South African Airways (SAA) -- generally regarded as one of the top airlines on the African continent -- has decided to concentrate on its African operations in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Announcing this here on Monday, SAA Senior Public Relations Manager, Leon Els, said there had been a 20-percent increase in travel into Africa in the past financial year, with almost 550,00 passengers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The number of flights into Africa has nearly doubled in the past four years, and SAA will continue to investigate the feasibility of additional flights on routes that have proved very popular, while at the same time capitalising on emerging markets,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In line with this policy, the South African airline has decided to start a new twice-weekly service to Abidjan in November, and to double its service to Accra with a second weekly flight, also from November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Els said this means that SAA will be operating a total of 59 weekly flights to 15 destinations in Africa and the Indian Ocean Islands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The news that SAA is to expand its African network has been welcomed by the South African Tourism Board (SATOUR).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SATOUR spokesman says research shows that 30 percent of overseas visitors to South Africa also wish to visit various African countries as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa had almost 200,000 visitors arriving by air from other African countries in 1995, he added, and they spent as much here as visitors from Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The travel industry here has also welcomed the expansion, expressing the hope that it would encourage businessmen who often found it more convenient to fly to certain African countries via Europe to now travel direct from South Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">servants converged at different venues around the country Tuesday for the eighth straight day of a work-stoppage to press for a 60 per cent salary increment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the capital Harare, hundreds of the government employees gathered downtown at Africa Unity Square, where union leaders urged them to maintain the work stoppage and ignore government threats to fire them all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While Public Service Commission Chairman Mariyawanda Nzuwah recently announced that the country's 161,000 civil servants had been awarded an average 20 per cent salary hike, the government employees said they had only been given up to 9 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Robert Mugabe, who returned from a visit to South Africa and Lesotho at the weekend, said he was unaware of the civil servants' grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I was happy because statistics showed an increase of 20 percent,&quot; Mugabe said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the strike would give government an opportunity to trim the bloated civil service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, one of the Civil Servants Union leaders, Felix Mafa, said Mugabe must have been misinformed by Nzuwah.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He (Mugabe) said we were given twenty percent, yet we got about nine percent. We want to know where the eleven percent difference went. Forward with the strike,&quot; Mafa said .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile Tuesday, the Foundation for Democracy in Zimbabwe, a local pressure group, has blamed the nationwide strike on government shortcomings including a lack of good labor relations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Government authorities,&quot; it said, &quot;have shown arrogance and a total lack of communication skills necessary for the maintenance of good labor relations.  &quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said government could end the crisis now if it immediately award salaries to civil servants commensurate with, and off-setting the rise in the cost of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;In addition, the government should cease forthwith any disbursements of the 32 million Zimbabwe dollars (3.2 million U.S. dollars) to ZANU PF and use the money to improve the working conditions of civil servants,&quot; it said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Poor policies and investment programmes and not drought and external factors are the reasons behind Africa's low agricultural output, the Global Coalition For Africa said Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is high time that the key role of agriculture as the engine for economic growth was recognized by African political leaders,&quot; the Coalition said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It stated its position at the two-day economic committee meeting on food security and external debt, which ends today in Addis Ababa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said that strategies for agricultural recovery and growth in sub-Sahara Africa called for &quot;real political commitment.&quot; This, it said, could be demonstrated by increasing the agricultural budget and by giving the sector priority in development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition called for consultation with &quot;key stakeholders&quot; and donors in the conception and execution of agricultural development plans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It wants governments to empower smallholder farmers, including women, as key stakeholders in agriculture; and to harmonize and exchange policy experiences through national and regional policy analysis networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The coalition noted that its proposals included recent initiatives by the Conference of Ministers of Agriculture of West, Central, Eastern and Southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The new approach has real prospects of contributing to a process that will lead to sustainable growth in agricultural production and productivity and must be fully supported both by African leaders and the international community,&quot; the coalition said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coalition aims at pulling Africa out of its poverty with the support of the advanced countries, including the G-7 nations, leading international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that encourage political and economic liberalism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Coalition was established in 1990 in Maastricht, a small Dutch town, under the initiative of the Netherlands government. The same year it set up its headquarters in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - A United States Embassy official in Lagos denied on Monday allegations by Nigeria's special duties minister, who accused the U.S.  Information Service of supporting a pirate radio opposed to the military government of the West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Minister Wada Nas, in an interview published by Nigerian newspapers Sunday, claimed that the U.S. Agency's office in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, had interviewed and was preparing travel documents for a Nigerian journalist being recruited for the opposition station, which calls itself Radio Democratic International Nigeria.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The U.S. government does not fund the radio,&quot; the embassy official told PANA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diplomat, who asked not to be named also denied the existence of Bruse Copohed, the official, whom Nas alleged had interviewed the Nigerian journalist for a job with the pirate radio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The radio, whose base is unknown, has been broadcasting anti-government programmes since June 12, the third anniversary of the country's 1993 presidential election cancelled by the last military regime of Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Diplomatic relations between Nigeria and the United States have been strained since the annulment of that presidential poll, with Washington imposing limited sanctions on the West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But diplomatic sources in Lagos said that despite the disagreements over democracy and human rights, the U.S. and European countries have avoided imposing oil sanctions on Nigeria, mainly because of their own economic interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. buys some 50 per cent of Nigeria's total crude oil, with North American and European multinationals playing a major part in the production.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEW YORK, United Nations - Burundi's permanent representative to the United Nations, Terence Nsanze, says any attempt by the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on the country will be &quot;unjust, illegal and contrary to the UN charter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nsanze told UN correspondents in New York Tuesday the Burundi government &quot; categorically rejects&quot; the arms embargo being proposed by the security council against Burundi, over the recent military coup in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It (the embargo) has no grounds in view of the impressive initiatives already taken by the new regime,&quot; the envoy said, adding that the Security Council should wait until the new regime, led by Maj. Pierre Buyoya, had proven to be &quot;incompetent, unqualified or engage in any atrocities.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that since Buyoya came into office on July 25, he had expressed his commitment to ending the massacres and all forms of violence in the country as well as to launch a new democratic process and to encourage the mediation efforts by the former Tanzanian president, Julius Nyerere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Nsanze, the government also plans to hold a national debate, to bring all ethnic groups together, in November and to engage in dialogue with the armed factions, if they lay down their arms and renounce violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said instead of imposing sanctions on Burundi, the Security Council should resort to a &quot;more-constructive, productive and beneficial diplomatic dynamics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nsanze said Burundi has proposed the establishment of an ad-hoc security council mission to be despatched to the great lakes region, whose countries have imposed economic sanctions to force out the new government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This fact-finding mission would allow the Security Council to take into account the current realities and the disastrous consequences which have been produced by this economic embargo,&quot; the permanent representative added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the regional sanctions had further worsened Burundi's economy, paralysed infrastructure, affected the populace, particularly women and children, and threatened to precipitate a food crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;What difference is there between a genocide by firearms and genocide by mass starvation and generalized diseases?&quot; the envoy asked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A draft security council resolution introduced by the non-aligned movement caucus urges imposition of an arms embargo on Burundi and, after 60 days, lead to the consideration of tougher measures unless the new government initiated efforts to reach a comprehensive political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related development, nsanze has accused the countries which imposed sanctions on Burundi of having hidden motives rather than acting in the interest of peace and security in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said apart from the fact that there was no precedent to the sanctioning of any country in the great lakes region over military coups, the sanctions violated the charters of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the UN.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;As a prerequisite, the security council should have been seized, in the interest of all concerned parties, of any possible measures to be taken,&quot; the ambassador said, adding that the council was not consulted before the sanctions were imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, the president of the UN security council, Tono Eitel of Germany, has said there is a possibility that the council will send a fact-finding mission to Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I would not exclude that but we are far from having discussed it, and we are far from having decided upon it,&quot; Eitel said, adding: &quot;but in the course of events, it is one measure that may be discussed in the council.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a letter sent to the council by Burundi's permanent representative, the proposed mission will look into the economic, political and security conditions in Burundi since the coup, and also investigate the alleged massacre of 6,000 Hutus since July 25.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Six countries, including four that already have troops in Liberia, have indicated their readiness to send forces to beef up ECOMOG, the West African Peace-Monitoring Force in the war-torn west African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sources at the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Lagos, have said that two countries, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, will be deploying troops for the first time since ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The force is currently estimated at 8,500 soldiers, with Nigeria contributing the bulk of the troops, followed by Ghana. Gambia, Benin and Mali are the other contributors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sources said these countries were expected to increase the number of their troops, in line with the decision of the recent meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, by west African leaders, who agreed to raise ECOMOG strength to 18,000 troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commenting on the Liberian crisis Tuesday, Brig.Gen. Fred Chijuka, Nigeria's director of defence information, confirmed that &quot;some countries have promised to contribute troops&quot; to strengthen ECOMOG.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">If &quot;all the countries can contribute 1,000 troops each, the problem would be solved,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Contributing countries, including Nigeria and Ghana, have had to scale down the strength of their soldiers in ECOMOG in the past out of frustration at the lack of progress in the Liberian peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the ECOWAS Committee of Nine, which met recently in Abuja adopted several sactions, including possible trial of leaders of any faction that violates the revised peace plan, for war crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The plan provides for a new cease-fire, deployment of ECOMOG troops and disarming of Liberian warriors to pave way for national election on May 30, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-year-old Liberian civil war has killed at least 150,000 people and defied a dozen previous peace accords brokered by the 16-nation ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - The British Standard Chartered Bank is selling off its 66.  6 million shares to the public from Sept. 2, to complete a phased divestment from Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bill Moore, regional coordinator of Standard Chartered Africa, said at a ceremony in Lagos Monday the divestment, which followed the 1993 collapse of Barings Bank of England, would fetch foreign stake holders some 499,328 U.S.  dollars.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The 50 kobo shares are being sold at a unit price of six naira to the public (80 naira = 1USD, and 100 kobo = one naira).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moore denied that the pull-out from First Bank Nigeria Plc, was politically motivated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said Standard Chartered management decided to divest its 57 foreign investments where it did not have management or majority control given the group's experience with Barings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are reviewing the scope of our activities worldwide,&quot; Moore said, adding: &quot;we have over 50 countries like Mozambique and Malawi, where we do not have management or majority control, including Europe and America where we sold our hotel.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The divestment would make First Bank fully Nigerian owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Corroborating Moore's argument, First Bank's Managing Director, Joseph Sanisu, said the technical partners were acting in line with the laws of the European Union and the British government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the divestment would not adversely affect the cordial relationship, spanning 102 years, between First Bank and Standard Chartered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">First Bank is Nigeria's leading financial institution in terms of its deposit and asset holding.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUMBE, Angola - Some 5,826 people died of malaria in the central-west Angolan Kwanza South province during the first half of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Teresa Joaquim, who heads the epidemiological surveillance section in the province's health department, the death toll was 190 people higher than those registered over the same period in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She added that 31,594 cases were diagnosed during the said period. Out of the cases, 18,405 were infants below the age of four, 6,541 of children between five and 14 years, while 6,648 others were found among adolescents aged 15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">She attributed the high increase in malaria cases in Kwanza south to the existence of a very weak primary health care system, lack of insecticide, the high cost of living and medicine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, 121 cases of biennorrhagia (a copious mucus discharge) were diagnosed over the period, 10 more than in 1995 over the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Concerning the incurable AIDS, Teresa Joaquim could not give actual figures because Kwanza south lacks laboratory equipment to carry out tests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - A two-day economic meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa has ended in Addis Ababa with a call for additional reduction of debt owed multilateral institutions and bilateral creditors by 33 sub-Sahara Africa countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The decision was reached by the consensus of debtors and creditors attending the meeting, the chairman of the Economic Committee, Kwesi Botchwey, told journalists Tuesday at the end of the meeting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said the magnitude of the debt of these highly indebted poor countries of Africa had resulted from the combined effects of sizeable external inflows and low growth rates of their exports over the last decade.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The meeting was attended by representatives from 16 African countries, 16 donor states and leading international financial institutions, including the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the African Development Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of the debt to be reduced for each of the 33 countries is to be decided at the annual meeting of the World Bank and the Fund to be held in October in Washington D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Total stock aggregate debt of the 33 countries stood at 164 billion U.S.  dollars in present value terms at the end of 1994 Botchwey, Ghana's former finance minister, said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the total amount, 64 per cent is owed to official bilateral creditors, 19 per cent to multilateral creditors and the remaining 17 per cent to private creditors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the total multilateral debt of African states, 25 per cent concerns the International Development Association, 22 per cent the World Bank, 13 per cent the African Development Bank, 13 per cent European and Arab development finance institutions, and the remaining to other creditors, the Global Coalition says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Botchwey said that the Coalition would further deliberate on debt reduction at its political forum gathering October 30-31 in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, with the view of contributing to the build-up of consensus for resolving the debt problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that the Addis Ababa meeting also recommended ways for improving the efficiency of agriculture production in Africa and ensuring food security in Africa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa - Africa is poised to become the third largest area of international mining exploration in the world, according to a senior executive of the South African mining group JCI Limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frank Gregory, JCI's general manager, said that as foreign companies intensify their surveys into the potential of Africa's mineral wealth, spending on exploration on the continent increased by 60 percent from 199 million U.S. dollars in 1994 to 320 million dollars in 1995.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addressing delegates at a mining investment conference in Johannesburg, he said this growth was the largest of any regional exploration budget in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Given this trend,&quot; he added, &quot;exploration expenditure in Africa could overtake Canada in 1996, placing this continent third after Latin America and Australia.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And all indications were, he said, that this upward trend would be maintained.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The factors making mining in Africa a more viable included the change in attitude of many African governments towards foreign investment, the fact that Africa was still mainly under-explored as a result of its history of instability, and the expected international increase in metals consumption as more developing countries moved toward industrialization, said Gregory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, he said that exploration in Africa still faced such stumbling blocks as inadequate infrastructure, health and safety hazards, inefficient administration and corruption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe - One method authorities all over the world have used to control the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been to constantly release statistics of its spread.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since reporting its first AIDS case in 1987, Zimbabwe has been at the forefront in releasing statistics on the incurable disease's whose cumulative estimates show that 10 per cent of the country's 10.5 million people are HIV- positive, at least 200,000 people have developed AIDS and are dying at the rate of 300 every week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The figures show that the southern African nation has the highest AIDS cases in sub-Saharan Africa. The figures have contributed significantly to the 90 per cent awareness rate of AIDS in the country but they have also contributed negatively to the country's image abroad.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In 1994, Zimbabwean delegates at the World Population Summit in Cairo, Egypt, had to fend off questions stemming from a British newspaper report that labelled the country as an AIDS haven.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the July 1996 Olympic Games in the United States, boxing officials from some countries were reportedly uncomfortable with their boxers fighting Africans, particularly those from Zimbabwe and Kenya where high rates of HIV/AIDS infection were quoted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At a recent AIDS workshop for Zimbabwe army officers a captain, who had just been on United Nations peacekeeping duty in Angola, said authorities in that country warned women against fraternizing with Zimbabwean soldiers because they were &quot;full of AIDS.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Such taunts have compelled people to ask such fundamental questions as to whether the situation is really that bad in Zimbabwe as compared with other countries. And if known statistics are just estimates, what are the actual reported statistics and, also, is the government aware of the consequences of releasing the high estimates?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ironically, actual recorded statistics for cumulative cases from 1987 to September 1995, released recently by the Ministry of Health, do not talk about the 10 per cent of the population being HIV positive or even the estimated 200,000 full-blown AIDS cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Instead, the figures show 48,882 actual tested cases by September 1995 and that up to 70,000 might develop full-blown AIDS by the end of 1996.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why then is there such a big disparity between estimates and real figures?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council technical director, Dr. Buhle Ncube, who recently resigned from the ministry of health's epidemiology and disease control department, said the high estimates were closer to reality than the actual tested cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Reasons for the big gap are that testing in Zimbabwe is not compulsory and there is gross under-reporting of HIV/AIDS infections,&quot; he said, &quot;as a result many people are classified as suffering from such AIDS-related illnesses as tuberculosis, hence the low figures of actual tested cases.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, she said that because Zimbabwe's health delivery system was more advanced than most developing countries, it was easy to make near accurate estimates of the trend of the disease from general visits to health institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An information and education officer in the ministry's Reproductive Department, Eunice Takawira, said that Zimbabwe's open reporting system made it appear like it had a worse HIV/AIDS problem than other countries yet, it probably was among the least affected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Some countries with low reported figures either have genuinely ineffective data collection systems or deliberately under-report their cases,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, Ncube and Takawira could not say whether government realized the consequences of its truthfulness, particularly the way Zimbabweans are being treated abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the health and child welfare minister, Dr. Timothy Stamps, has often said government has an obligation to inform the people truthfully as a way to control the disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, the medical profession is convinced that the constant hype of the high statistics could have been a major contributor to the drop in sexually transmitted infections and cases of tuberculosis which have been noticed lately in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to statistics, cases of sexually transmitted infections rose from 686,500 in 1986 to 1.24 million in 1991. Then there was a sudden drop to about 879,000 in 1992 and 1993 and again down to 694,428 by September 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This could be a good indication of positive sexual behavioral change among Zimbabweans,&quot; said Lt. Col. Alexander Musoko, the director of medical services of the Zimbabwe army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Also showing a decline are reported cases of Tuberculosis which peaked at 25,956 in 1994 before dropping to 22,200 by September 1996 and are expected to drop further in 1996 and beyond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">However, it is not lost to the medical experts that the drop in sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis could be a result of people not reporting their illnesses and so they expect new AIDS cases to rise by a yearly rate of 10,000 until the year 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the question remains, should the government continue releasing the high estimates and increase Zimbabweans' discrimination abroad or should it take other countries' lead and stick to reported cases only which apparently are much lower than in other countries?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MBABANE, Swaziland - After allegations of police involvement with drugs racketeers, there has been a shake up in Swaziland's police force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mass transfers of officers at various stations around the country, especially the stations in the vicinity of the borders with South Africa and Mozambique, are underway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A long list of police officers are in the process of being transferred to other stations following information concerning large numbers of police involved in drugs smuggling.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is understood the mass transfers follow the arrests in July of two South African men by Swazi police after the men's van was found to be loaded with bales of dagga as they were driving to the Oshoek border on the Mbabane- Motshane-Oshded main road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The occupants told the police they had bought the dagga from Swazis in the Piggs Peak area and were on their way to deliver it to buyers in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to informants, several Piggs Peak police officers, including senior officers at the Piggs Peak police station, except the station commander, have been working in league with the dagga farmers along the Swazi/South African border in northwest Swaziland and dagga smugglers. For this reason, the smugglers were not bothered by police in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Piggs Peak police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The involvement of the police in the dagga smuggling was exposed by angry members of the Piggs Peak community who lodged complaints at the police headquarters in Mbabane, demanding the police commissioner take disciplinary action against those involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Piggs Peak magistrate has also announced that from now on, consignments of confiscated drugs of various types in northwest Swaziland will no longer be sent to the Piggs Peak police station for safe keeping pending the destruction of the drugs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Swaziland drugs squad police has been working in cooperation with INTERPOL, the international police, to curb the smuggling of drugs by international syndicates using Swaziland as a soft transit route to smuggle hard drugs like mandrax into South Africa - and as a plentiful source of Swazi grown dagga consignments some of which have been intercepted by police in Germany.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Riverside - The Center for Women in Coalition at the University of California, Riverside is organizing a conference, &quot;Frontline Feminisms: Women, War, and Resistance&quot; to take place on campus January 16-18, 1997.  Participants will discuss the forging of new feminisms in the context of militarized situations around the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference aims to link feminist activist and grass-roots organizers engaged in innovative feminist praxes with a gathering of scholars and policy- makers engaged in theorizing conflict and promoting cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Featured participants will include women from the Balkans, the Middle East, Central America, South Asia, the Philippines, Africa, and the United States.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Workshop, film/video, visual art, creative writing and paper proposals are due August 1. All scholars and activists interested in attending are invited to send their mailing and/or e-mail addresses to the organizers for inclusion on the mailing list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Conference registration will be $30 ($15 for students) and modestly-priced lodging will be available. (Registration and lodging can be waived in case of need.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The conference is international in scope and we are interested in flying activists from different parts of the world. This is of course dependent on funding. We have invited women associated with the politics of the Balkans, South Asia, Central America/Mexico, Israel and Palestine, Iran, and hope to expand our contacts in sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and South America.  However, we are particularly interested in creating linkages between local and national activists and scholars with women from other parts of the world.  In southern California, there is a richness of activism among Mexican- American, Native American Asian- American communities and we will be tapping into these regional networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Confirmed speakers include: Vasanthi Raman, Senior Fellow, Center for Women's Development Studies, New Delhi; Soona Samsami, Member Foreign Affairs Committee, National Council of Iran; Gila Svirsky, Member and Founder, Women in Black Advisory Council, Israel Women's Network; Rachel Wareham, Activist and Trainer; Motrat Qiriazi-Rural women activists; Kosovo Kemi Oyarzun, Founder, Center for Women's Studies, Santiago, Chile. This list does not include the many academic scholars who have either committed themselves to, or expressed interest in, participating. Also, we are working with the rich network of activist groups in Southern California that are addressing issues such as immigration, political asylum, and labor, which are closely linked with struggles elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The conversations will not only connect the &quot;global&quot; and the &quot;local&quot; they will also connect the &quot;academic&quot; with the &quot;practical&quot;. As such, we are welcoming all sorts of texts and discourses -- papers can follow the conventions of academic conferencing, but they can also include creative writing, photodocumentary essays, installations, film/video. They can and will be bi or tri-lingual and interpreters will be on hand! We hope that conversations are multiple, linking scholars with activists, poets, artists and whatever intersections and permutations of both. There will be panel presentations, workshops and films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. We remain open -- in policy -- to any ideas and creative possibilities which we can accomodate within the constraints we have: time and money. So please do get in touch with us -- about people both here and internationally who we could contact. We are already heartened by the enthusiasm which is seeping in from all quarters of global cyber-space and will follow any &quot;lead&quot; you suggest. Please note again that our funding IS limited in terms of being able to pay for air-tickets but we are going to be creative about good but cheap accommodation in Riverside -- and transportation within the area (to and from airports etc).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. We are also committed to trying to financially assist women who are not connected to any sources of conventional funding (university, foundations etc) and who will be prohibited because of financial inability to pay for train/plane tickets, housing etc.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. We are also planning to put together an anthology of writing about these issues (again both academic and other kinds of work) which will be published.  We intend to archive (both in text and video) the conference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Toronto - Inaugurated in 1995 to both critical and audience acclaim, Planet Africa returns as a regular part of the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival, presenting films from Africa and the African diaspora. Programmed by Cameron Bailey, Planet Africa includes six world premieres in a programme of eight features and five short films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We generated a lot of enthusiasm last year with a modest slate of films,&quot; says Bailey. &quot;This year we're back with a larger programme including several world premieres and more films from more of the African world. We've covered the continent more broadly with films from southern, northern and western Africa, as well as other parts of the Diaspora. This year establishes Toronto as the place in North America to see new African film each year.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following are the films featured in this year's Planet Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WHEN THE STARS MEET THE SEA (QUAND LES ETOILES RENCONTRENT LA MER) - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Raymond Rajaonarivelo, Madagascar/France, 1996 Madagascar's pre- eminent filmmaker establishes his place at the forefront of African cinema with this majestic film taking his story from a particularly resonant Malagasy myth. A boy, born on the day of an eclipse in a small village, is believed to possess great and dangerous powers. As a test, he must endure one night alone among the cattle. But a childless young woman rescues him, forever changing his fate. This startlingly beautiful film reveals Madagascar as one of the last magical places on earth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ARISTOTLE'S PLOT - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Jean-Pierre Bekolo, Zimbabwe/France, 1996 ARISTOTLE'S PLOT began as the African entry in the British Film Institute's commemoration of the centenary of cinema. Instead of a respectful documentary like Martin Scorsese's US contribution, Bekolo serves up a wild hybrid that's half meditation on the trials of African moviemaking, half action movie send-up.  In a southern African town, a group of wannabe gangsters hangs out at the Cinema Africa, megadosing on the latest actionfest while assuming the names of their screen gods: Van Damme, Bruce Lee, Nikita, Saddam, and the leader, Cinema. Enter an earnest cineaste, trying in vain to enlist the government's help in cleansing the Cinema Africa of Hollywood contamination, replacing Schwarzenegger with Ousmane Sembene. Taking matters into his own hands, he becomes a vigilante for a home-grown film culture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">EVERYONE'S CHILD - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Tsitsi Dangarembga, Zimbabwe, 1996. In her debut feature, Commonwealth Writer's Prize-winning playwright and novelist Tsitsi Dangarembga distills the statistics of the millions of African children orphaned because of AIDS. When their parents die suddenly, Tamari and her brother Itai must fend for both themselves and their younger siblings. Itai heads to Harare, where local hoods take him in and train him in the ways of the street. Back in the village, Tamari accepts the advances of a lecherous shopkeeper. As she tries to use his gifts to pay for her siblings' schooling, the village women suggest she leave, to keep the village safe for their husbands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">JOHN HENRIK CLARKE: A GREAT AND MIGHTY WALK - World Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: St. Clair Bourne, USA, 1996. African-American historian John Henrik Clarke is a legend among scholars. Born into sharecropping, self- taught long before he entered academia, he possesses an astounding knowledge of the roots and branches of African history. He's also a great talker.  Veteran documentarian St. Clair Bourne (MAKING DO THE RIGHT THING) lets the man do just that in this remarkable documentary, weaving Clarke's words into a mix of archival treasures and image manipulation. From ancient Egypt, we move through the Mediterranean, Africa's great empires, the slave trade, and African American history right up to the Million Man March. Though now blind, Clarke has lost none of his razor-sharp edge. &quot;If you lose your eyesight,&quot; he says, &quot;increase your insight.&quot; Narrated and executive produced by Wesley Snipes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A SUMMER IN LA GOULETTE (UN ETE A LA GOULETTE) - North American Premiere</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Ferid Boughedir, Tunisia/France/Belgium, 1995 Ferid Boughedir's first film since his acclaimed HALFAOUINE is a sly comedy full of warmth, wit and exuberance, as he crafts a glorious portrait of a Tunisian resort neighbourhood where Muslims, Christians and Jews live side by side. It's the summer of 1967, and three teenage girls vow to lose their virginity by the festive Day of the Madonna. As events come to a boil, reports filter in about a potential war in the Middle East. But the people of La Goulette are captivated by more immediate news -- the nation's most treasured daughter, the celestial Claudia Cardinale (playing herself), is returning from Europe for a triumphant visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">MACADAM TRIBE (MACADAM TRIBU)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Jose Laplaine, France/Zaire/Mali, 1996 Laplaine's lively, comic first feature weaves unemployment, lust and family commitments into a series of scenes-from-the-quarter. Mike is an ex-con and layabout, while his brother Kapa spends his time boxing with his amateur-fighter friend Duka. The brothers are deeply concerned about their mother, Mother Bavusi, a former market woman who now spends her days quietly getting drunk. When Duka is knocked into a coma, the whole neighborhood of strivers, whores and amateur philosophers rallies together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">THE WATERMELON WOMAN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Director: Cheryl Dunye, USA, 1996</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This debut feature from one of America's leading indie media stars, is fierce, funny and genuinely romantic. Dunye plays Cheryl, whose main passion is a forgotten black act or credited only as the Watermelon Woman. Frustrated by slim pickings on the dating front, Cheryl puts her energy into tracking down her mystery mammy. Moving effortlessly between fiction and mock documentary, Dunye reclaims the history of black-cast movies as she affectionately skewers the coupling habits of downtown Philadelphia lesbians.  Meanwhile, Cheryl falls for a flirty white girl named Diana, (GO FISH discovery Guin Turner). Cameo by legendary motormouth and lesbian icon Camille Paglia.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Phelps Dodge, a United States mining company and manufacturer of electrical wire and cables, carbon black, and tyres, has acquired 51 per cent majority shareholding in Zambia Metal Fabricators Limited (ZAMEFA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Introducing the new ZAMEFA management in Lusaka on Wednesday, United States ambassador to Zambia, Roland Kuchel, said Zambia had acquired another world class leader in business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Zambian worker will benefit by working in a company which looks at the worker as a partner,&quot; Ambassador Kuchel assured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ambassador Kuchel said &quot;in dealing with raw materials, the company creates an opportunity for growth and export in the manufacturing industry&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to a Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA) press statement released in Lusaka on Wednesday, other ZAMEFA shareholders are Bikana International Limited and the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund (ZPTF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And from the balance of shares formerly owned by the government, through ZIMCO (in liquidation), ZPTF will own 18 per cent shares for onward sale to the general public in Zambia through public floatation on the Lusaka Stock Exchange at a later stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And speaking at the same function ZPA chief executive, Valentine Chitalu, said &quot;ZAMEFA is an important company in the matter of pursuing foreign markets, also taking into account that it holds great significance on the amount of local business it attracts&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A ZAMEFA executive confirmed that the company's business has undergone a lot of change, especially on the local market, from enjoying a virtual monopoly in local supply of copper wire and cable, it now faces stiff competition from international suppliers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In particular, ZAMEFA's two major customers, ZAMTEL and ZESCO, have put out to tender their wire and cable supplies as a way of cutting down costs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As there are no other wire and cable producers in Zambia, all copper rods are exported - mostly outside the southern African region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Copper rods sales account for between 60 and 75 per cent of ZAMEFA's total sales in the last five years.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Blantyre, Malawi - Journalists should expose all human rights violations, regardless of who is involved, a Dutch international human rights professor told more than forty editors from 12 SADC countries meeting in Blantyre yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Cees Hamelink, of University of Amsterdam in Holland, yesterday said journalists must take keen interest in reporting and exposing all cases of human rights violations taking place in their countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hamelink said that all countries are, in one way or another, involved in violations of human rights and that these incidents must be brought out for the public to know.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Its the duty of the media to defend human rights and fight their abuse regardless of whether the government, or whoever are involved, may not like it,&quot; Professor Hamelink said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hamelink, who addressed editors on professional claims and practices on human rights reporting, said that most governments find it difficult to accept many important issues on international human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Amnesty international, a human rights organisation, he said continuously highlighted the abuses but few countries seem to respond.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hamelink noted that for good reportage of human rights issues it was important that there was independence, compassionate, fairness and accuracy in the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Accuracy in reporting human rights is important because journalists are teachers on whom so many people depend on,&quot; Professor Hamelink said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hamelink emphasised that every individual had a right to dignity, liberty and integrity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Individuals are more important than their government,&quot; Professor Hamelink said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said most human rights abuses go unpunished and very few people, including journalists, follow up such crucial issues although they are prevalent in their communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Hamelink urged journalists to make a difference and turn a new leaf in the field of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that while constant reportage of human rights abuses would not guarantee an overnight improvement of the situation, the action would make a difference.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Zambia has stabilised in that the economy had grown by about five to six per cent, said Bank of Zambia director of economics department, Felix Kani in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kani, speaking at the ongoing International Banking Conference being held at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre, however, acknowledged that the Zambian economy had suffered some &quot;shocks&quot; in the mining sector over the low production and prices as well as the closure of some banks.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kani revealed that the major challenge experienced by the Bank of Zambia last year had been to maintain economic stability &quot;with three banks in receivership and one in liquidation&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kani advised that there was need for the Bank of Zambia to have a tight supervisory capacity over the country's financial institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Most important is the flow of information in a market economy,&quot; Kani said.  &quot;Inadequate information leads to speculation from businessmen which can upset the economy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Professor Lawrence Harris from the University of London, while recognising the progress made in the Zambian banking sector, noted that the country was still living with the effects of the liquidity injection which had characterised government's desperate efforts to rescue Meridien BIAO Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A 47 per cent increase in money supply is not benign and must be watched closely if the economic reform programme is to be kept on track,&quot; Professor Harris said, noting that the increase in money supply might be an indicator of spiralling inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Professor Harris also urged the independence of the central bank as a factor in lowering the rate of inflation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Lusaka - Economic liberalisation needs good management if it is to benefit the country in which it is implemented, said former Bank of Zambia governor, Dominic Mulaisho, in Lusaka yesterday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulaisho, participating in a panel discussion at the International Banking Conference which started yesterday at Lusaka's Mulungushi International Conference Centre, said liberalisation which does not take in the human capacity can be chaotic and destructive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;There is need for human resources to manage libera-lisation otherwise liberalisation turns into a monster you cannot control,&quot; Mulaisho said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mulaisho encouraged investment in human resources as a factor towards growth in a liberalised economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">University of Zambia's Professor Venkatesh Seshamani, speaking at the same conference, said growth without development has been a frequent experience in developing countries, being recorded only in figures but not visibly experienced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seshamani said apart from the usual measure of the implementation and the impact of the economic reforms, the success of economic policies could also depend on errant factors such as the terms of trade, both internationally and locally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But Dr Mohsin Kahn, deputy director of research at the International Monetary Fund, argued that there can be no growth without development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Financial liberalisation leads to development and then leads to growth,&quot; Dr Kahn said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr Kahn maintained that due to liberalisation, an environment would be created where growth could begin to take place though it should not be expected to happen overnight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference sponsored by the Bank of Zambia, among others, is being attended by some African countries and representatives of the major business organisations in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the conference, &quot;Economic Liberalisation&quot;, dominates all the topics of the three-day meeting which is also being attended by university professors from the United Kingdom, United States, some officers of United Nations organisations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chairman of the meeting yesterday, Bank of Zambia deputy governor, Situmbeko Muso-kotwane, said studies had shown that countries which had undertaken structural reforms around the world performed better economically than the ones which hadn't.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Liberalisation is not an end in itself but the means to achieving the end,&quot; Musokotwane said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Finance minister Ronald Penza, who officially opened the meeting, said the year of 1995 had been an important challenge to the government in light of the banking crisis brought about by the collapse of Meridien BIAO Bank, Africa Commercial Bank, and Commerce Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;This seriously threatened to undermine the economy...1996 also poses serious challenges. Restoring macro-economic stability remains high on the agenda,&quot; Penza said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Penza said it was time that southern Africa concentrated on restructuring its economies in view of the nominal growth recorded by all the members.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a vote of thanks to the minister's speech, Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) member, Murray Sanderson, cynically said the business community was grateful that the government had set in motion various initiatives such as the expedient privatisation of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are also extending our gratitude to the government for the flexibility in the matter of dealing with the bilateral donors, considering the importance of donor aid to economic stability,&quot; Sanderson said in closing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Dr. Befekadu Degeufe, one of the most prominent Ethiopian economists and perhaps the most vocal of those still residing in Ethiopia, says in unequivocal terms that land in Ethiopia should be freely bought and sold (&quot;Tobia&quot; Magazine, 4th year, No.9). He goes on to say:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let priority be given to those who sell their land if there is such a need.  Unless land is bought and sold on a purely commercial basis, the free movement of investors from region to region will be severely restricted in the short term&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But there is a greater force that compels people to move from one region to another and this is the relentless population growth. People are forced to migrate to other regions as a result of land shortage and soil depletion. The barrier to inter-regional movement of people that may be temporarily erected by ethnicity-based regionalization and language policy will be broken asunder by the implacable growth of population&quot;.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The EPRDF is opposed to private ownership of land for fear that peasants would sell their land and migrate to towns only to swell the ranks of the unemployed. This may sound a legitimate fear, but the policy will not stop migration caused by population pressures and as such can only be thought of as a short-term solution&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;With respect to urban land and housing construction, a very amazing and deplorable situation has been created. Where the Derg regime encouraged individuals to build homes by educating mortgage rates, the EPRDF has gone two steps backwards to resurrect the condition prevalent under feudal land monopoly&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is gratifying to note that as knowledgeable and experienced a scholar as Dr. Befekadu is in favor of private ownership of land with undiminished property rights, including the right of sale and purchase. However, we would like to indicate that arguments in favor of private ownership of land should be strongly presented by detailing the following additional major points:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Private ownership of land does not exclude the existence of other forms of land tenure such as public domain, cooperative and communal ownership;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. The reason why land ownership has become such a burning development issue is because the current mechanism for the supply of land under state ownership is grossly inefficient and because state monopoly on land and the resulting inefficient mode of its disposition have sent land prices sky-high;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unwarranted restrictions on land use resulting from state ownership of land have adversely affected efficiency in its utilization;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Private ownership of rural peasant plots would enable smallholder farmers to use land as collateral for small rural credits;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The assumption that peasants would sell their land and migrate to town en masse is not supported by historical and traditional evidence and experience and underestimates the farmer's rational decision-making behavior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Would farmers continue to sell their lands and flock to towns even after feedback information that such behavior is met with wretched urban unemployment?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the question of economic growth, or the lack of it, under EPRDF's rule, Dr. Befekadu has put forward some rather convincing and officially authoritative statistics. These show that at the end of 1993/94, i.e. more than three years after the seizure of power by the EPRDF, Ethiopia's real GDP (12.05 billion birr) was lower than in 1989/90 (12.09 billion birr) when the Derg was still in power. Further, Dr. Befekadu convincingly concludes that compared to the level of real GDP in 1989/90, there was no economic growth from 1990/91 to 1993/94, i.e. three full years and three months of EPRDF's rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to the statistics presented, it was only in 1994/95 that there was some growth (4.8 percent) over the 1989/90 level (figures for 1995/96 are not given in his analysis). He concludes that year-on-year growth registered from 1991/92 to 1993/94 was due to the low-base factor, representing recovery rather than growth in the real sense of the word.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Factoring population growth into his calculations, Dr. Befekadu derives the very sobering conclusion that in fact daily per capita income declined from 59 cents in 1989/90 (the last full year of the Derg regime) to 57 cents in 1993/94.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On other facets of the national economy, Dr. Befekadu establishes the following facts on the basis of the government's own official statistics: That, although some of it is accounted for by birr devaluation, the country's annual resource gap increased from 822 million birr in 1989/90 to nearly 2.8 billion birr in 1993.94, indicating unabated heavy dependence on external loans and grants;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the country's external debt burden burgeoned from 6 billion birr in 1989/90 to 28.7 billion birr in 1994/95;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That, similarly, the government's domestic debt went up from 6 billion in 1989/90 to 12.3 billion birr in 1994/95;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the government's budget deficit had soared from 2.1 billion birr in 1989/90 to 4.1 billion in 1993/94, although in 1994/95 it did decrease precipitously to about 2.4 billion birr;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the total volume of money expanded significantly from 6.7 billion birr in 1990/91 to 14.0 billion birr in 1994/95;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That overall inflation accelerated by 36 percent between 1990/91 and 1994/95.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Even assuming that the government's own official statistics are free of &quot; political doctoring&quot;, Dr. Befekadu has credibly established that all the euphoria in government circles and on the government-controlled mass media about year-on-year economic growth in the past few years is misplaced and unwarranted and that per capita income has in fact declined over those years, implying the further impoverishment of the broad masses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also implicitly indicated that the illusion of growth has been created by the folly of making statistical comparisons within short spans of time rather than viewing developments in their proper long-term perspective. What do government bureaucrats have to say to such rather startling revelations? Or would they rather continue toeing the futile official line of trying to &quot; create reality&quot; with dodgy official statistics and specious statistical comparisons?</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - No-one who has been in Addis Ababa longer than a few hours needs to be told that motorists' respect for traffic regulations - in particular taxis - leaves a lot to be desired. The soaring number of vehicles seen in the capital, combined with carelessness, is showing a rise in property damage and loss of life.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In most cases, when someone is in an accident involving a taxi, the owner of that taxi is unable to pay for the damage due to lack of insurance. If you are unfortunate enough to be a pedestrian or passenger injured by a taxi, who is going to foot the medical costs?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no doubt that taxis are an invaluable service in our city. They transport thousands of commuters to and from work and personal business every day. It is also unquestionable that the majority of people who use taxis are in the low income bracket - in no position to pay heavy bills. To protect citizens, compulsory insurance for taxis needs to be enforced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government should look into this legal oversight. We have learned that some insurance companies refuse to insure taxis no matter how high the price.  Stricter measures against traffic offenders, intoxicated drivers etc., is another important step. We can recognize and reward safe taxi drivers (say, with car stickers), to encourage others to follow their example .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In actual fact it is time every vehicle in Ethiopia was required to have compulsory insurance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Tenants in Addis Ababa of some 27,100 houses and other such structures administered by Region 14 (i.e. Addis Ababa) and being used as business premises will reportedly be subject to stiff rent increases of up to 34 birr per square meter effective as of the beginning of the third week of August 1996 (&quot;Addis Lisan&quot;, Nehase 11, 1988 E.C.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For the purpose of the rent hikes, the Administration of Region 14 (or Addis Ababa) has ranked &quot;Kebeles&quot; (districts) and houses in Addis Ababa in three grades, namely first, second and third grades. The &quot;Kebeles&quot; are graded on the basis of location while houses are ranked according to the building materials of which they are made. Rent increases are also correlated with the grades assigned to roads. For example, houses located along main arteries are charged higher rents than those situated along feeder (inner) roads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newly announced rents range from a high of 34 birr per square meter for grade-one houses located in &quot;Kebeles&quot; designated &quot;grade one&quot; and along main arteries, to 6 birr per square meter for grade-three houses situated in &quot; Kebeles&quot; designated &quot;grade three&quot; and along feeder (inner) roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is a sample of the newly announced rent list:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">House Ranks Rent Per Square Meter in Birr</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1 Grade one &quot;Kebeles&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1 Main arteries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1.1 Grade-one houses 34</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1.2 Grade-two houses 33</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.1.3 Grade-three houses 31</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2 Feeder (inner) roads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2.1 Grade-one houses 31</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2.2 Grade-two houses 30</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.2.3 Grade-three houses 28</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2 Grade two &quot;Kebeles&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1 Main roads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1.1 Grade-one houses 26</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1.2 Grade-two houses 24</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.1.3 Grade-three houses 23</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hence, a tenant in the area of whose premises is thirty square meters and whose premises are located along one of the roads designated &quot;highway&quot; in one of the grade-one &quot;kebeles&quot;, and which premises are made of stone, will have to fork out a monthly rent of 1020 birr. Would this be considered high?  Compared to the previous rent, it is extremely high. The same house would not have rented for more than 70 - 80 birr on the basis of the old rent rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, compared to average current free-market rates, 1020 birr might just be a little bit on the high side, but not all that much higher.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The rent increases have already created a public outcry, and not just among business people who are going to be directly affected by them, but also among tenants of government-owned houses at large, the latter thinking that it would be their turn next time around! The rent hikes would hurt user-tenants (those who have not sublet their tenements) more than sublessees (those occupying sublet premises).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sublessors are going to be hurt most because they have lost their rent contracts with the Administration of Region 14 altogether! On the sidelines, previous owners of all these government-owned houses confiscated by the Derg may just muster enough enthusiasm about it all to snicker with some glee over the scramble for the properties which by rights are theirs and over the apparent appreciation of &quot;their&quot; assets!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Is the Administration of Region 14 wrong in making the rent increases? This in fact is not the first question to ask. What should first be questioned is whether the government in general is right in continuing to be in possession of properties which legally belong to some private citizens of Ethiopia? One may start yawning at the very idea of raising the question yet one more time, but the fact is that a wrong will endure unless righted or somehow redressed.  The ranking thought of having been dispossessed in the present context of the transition to the restoration of the rights of private property is making a lot more bad blood than during the days of the Derg when private property was at any rate almost wholly proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On a more practical plane, the question raised earlier on may now be put forward: Is the Administration of Region 14 right in raising rents? Here the magnitude of the increase is the most important debating point. The Administration may well be criticized for increasing rents so steeply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The increases should have been moderate, phased over a reasonably long period of time. Further, the termination of rent contracts with sublessors without due warning and without giving them a chance to renew their contracts does not appear to be an act done in good faith. Another question is: has some sort of comparison been made between the increased rents and the incomes of those affected by them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the issue of the probable consequences of the rent increases, the following may be underscored:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Continued strife between sublessors and sublessees;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Attempts by those remaining in their tenements after the rent increases to recoup some of their loss of income by raising prices;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Vacating of tenements by those who cannot afford to pay the new rents, thereby possibly joining the ranks of the unemployed;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Making the possibility of returning confiscated properties to previous owners or paying them adequate compensation more remote, because of the high revenue and valuation implications of the increased rents;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Well, finally one can only insinuate that two wrongs don't make a right!  There is plenty of time to reconsider the decision to increase rents so steeply.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - Congress is now deciding how much it will spend next year to help the poor abroad. Last year, the US dropped to fourth place in total dollars spent on development and humanitarian aid. Of 21 industrialized countries, the US spends the smallest proportion of its national wealth on aid--just 0.1 percent of GNP. While the total amount allocated to foreign assistance in fiscal year 1997 year looks likely to be around $12 billion, Congress has already voted to spend $276.7 billion on defense next year--$11.  2 billion more than the Pentagon requested.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two different versions of the FY97 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill (H.R. 3540) have passed in the House and the Senate. Soon after Congress returns from the August recess, members of both houses will meet in the Foreign Operations Appropriations conference committee to reconcile differences between the two bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Senate bill allocates more money for foreign assistance: a total of $12.  2 billion, as opposed to $11.9 billion in the House version. It also reestablishes the Development Fund for Africa (DFA), which was eliminated in last year's bill. The DFA was created by Congress in 1987 to direct US aid to Africa's poor majority. The Senate language holds US contributions to the International Development Association (IDA), the interest-free lending facility of the World Bank, at $700 million. This is not sufficient to fulfill US commitments, but is higher than the House version. Finally, the Senate allocates $27 million for debt reduction programs which would benefit many highly-indebted African nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The House version offers stronger support for the African Development Foundation (ADF). Although it keeps the ADF's funding at last year's level ($11.5 million), it protects these funds by preserving the ADF's separate budget line.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC - A delegation composed of Andrea A. Maketh, newly appointed by the SPLA as Commissioner for Yirol County, Msgr. Caesar Mazzolari, Apostolic Administrator Diocese of Rumbek and Fr. Kizito Sesana, responsible for the SCIO, flew from Nairobi to Akot in order to witness the release of six missionaries. Rumors had reached Nairobi that the missionaries had been under house arrest since 17 August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nairobi SPLA office attributed this to the action of a local commander and told the press they would be freed by noon of the same 23 August. When the delegation arrived in Akot the missionaries were not at the airstrip, as expected.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The delegation asked to proceed to Mapourdit, the actual mission station, at about 35 km from Akot, where the six missionaries are running a parish, a primary school with 1,500 students and a dispensary. The delegation was able to proceed to Agany, in the vicinity of Mapourdit, at the office of the Commissioner. When the local military commander arrived, it was negotiated that the delegation could see and speak first with the four missionaries held in Row Prison, also in the vicinity, and see the other two, still held in the compound of Mapourdit Mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four in prison were: Sr. Moira Lynch, 73, Australian; Sr. Mary Batchelor, 68, Australian; Fr. Michael Barton, 48, American; Fr. Raphael Riel, 48, Sudanese and Vicar General of Rumbek Diocese. Sr. Maureen Carey, 52, Australian and Brother Raniero Iacomella, 26, Italian, were said to be free, but held in the compound of the Mission for &quot;their own security&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the afternoon the delegation was able to see the four prisoners for few minutes, and they appeared to be in good physical conditions. At the later meeting with the military commander of Rumbek and Yirol Counties, Daniel Deng Manydit, the delegation learned that the local commander had acted with his knowledge and consent; that no instructions to release the prisoners had been received and that they will be held until investigations are completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The charges against the four missionaries were stated as: &quot;hindering SPLA recruitment, being found in possession of documents proving that they are spies from foreign countries, working for the spread of Islam under the disguise of the Cross&quot;. In the meantime Msgr. Mazzolari was able to put together from morsels of information collected from people what had happened.  Saturday 17 at 5.30 a.m. the mission was surrounded and seal off.  The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or in isolation.  Later the mission was looted. Several Christians as well as the Commissioner expressed to Msgr. Mazzolari their conviction that the action was a mistake condemned by the majority of civilians, and pleaded with him to organize for a quick restart the school as soon as the situation will normalize. Sunday 25 in the morning at 11 am Msgr. Mazzolari and Fr. Kizito decided to go back to Nairobi to inform the embassies of the concerned people and the media on the real situation in Mapourdit, an to intensify contacts with the SPLA leadership. Msgr. Mazzolari appeals to the SPLA leadership the guarantee the well-being of the missionaries while the investigations take their course, and, certain that the missionaries will prove to be totally innocent, is on his side more than willing to continue humanitarian, educational and religious work at the service of the civilians in Mapourdit area.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - The Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission announced here yesterday that the task of transporting people encircled by floods in Alem Tena, Ejere and Illu woredas of West Shoa Zone, Oromiya to the Tefki Encampment has continued with vigour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">About 300 persons, domestic animals and household utensils have successfully been transported thorough efforts being carried out in ten seriously affected peasant associations since Thursday, the commission said, adding plastic and motor boats and amphibians obtained from the Defence Force and the Ministry of Agriculture were employed for the purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The effort of rescuing life still continues, the commission said and added that the flood affected citizens are being provided with food and clothings.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said a consolidated life-saving effort is being made with the support of members of the Defence Force to help citizens stranded by a road blocked in Wonji Kuriftu caused by the route diversion of the Awash River to reach Nazareth on foot along the main road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Of the 11 water wells sunk near the Awash Basin to supply water to Nazareth town, three have been flooded whereas the remaining for which flood protection has been made are functioning normally, according to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Similarly, in Wonji, the commission said, 17,000 flood affected persons are being assisted in the six temporary camps prepared until Sunday in Wonji Shoa, Alem Tena, Chaka, Mekonnen Boka, Gefersa, Dedemtu and School Number Four.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to the assistance being made to the displaced, the process of searching for individuals to prove that no one has been left behind, with the help of motor boats some of which were secured from the Ministry of Defence, it s still under way, the commission said. No reports of human casualties so far, it added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Federal Government which has set up various committees for the purpose is doing all in its capacity to assist the displaced in temporary camps with the help of helicopters, vehicles and amphibians, according to the commission.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has said that the ever increasing level of poverty would have incalculable political and social consequences if it is not arrested and reversed in time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Opening the two day Economic Committee meeting of the Global Coalition for Africa (GCA), Ato Meles said, &quot;the remedy for what ills Africa has whether it is its poverty that pricks one's conscience or whether it is its instability that arouses one's concern, lies in removing the obstacles to Africa's economic and social regeneration and to its development.&quot; he noted that &quot;if Africa fails to do so, it would remain to wallow in its poverty with all it consequences and the achievement of peace and stability in the continent would remain a distant dream.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He emphasized that the unique partnership for which the Global Coalition is a vehicle is also based on the firm realization that a speeded up and accelerated economic development of Africa is not only in the interest of the continent but also in the interest of others.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He also expressed his belief that the exchange of views and sharing of experiences are vital in availing the forum of &quot;building consensus on the appropriate steps that need to be taken and on ways and means to pull Africa out of economic quagmire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Ahmadou Adbulla, Executive Secretary of GCA, said on his part that it has to be understood that a great deal has been achieved by most African countries. Problems in leadership commitment for development and transparency still happen to be challenges for progress throughout the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to ENA reports the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Director General, Jacques Diouf says Ethiopia's effort to achieve food self- sufficiency within a short period of time would be worth emulation by other African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During talks with Prime Minister Meles Zenawi yesterday, Mr.Diouf expressed his conviction that Ethiopia would sometime be able to assist other countries particularly in the area of agricultural expertise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Promoting irrigation in areas characterised by water shortage is vital to improve agricultural productivity and guarantee food self sufficiency, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Diouf expressed his organisation's appreciation of the dedication exhibited by Ethiopia, particularly of Prime Minister Meles, who in his capacity as chairman of the OAU last year made great effort to make the World Food Summit scheduled to be held in Rome in mid November a success.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 90 heads of state and non governmental organisations are expected to participate in the summit from which Africa hopes to benefit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prime Minister Meles on his part briefed the director general on the activities undertaken by the Ethiopian government in the agricultural sector to achieve food self sufficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He commended the assistance the World Food Organisation has made to date to promote agricultural productivity in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mr. Jackques Diouf arrived Sunday to attend the ongoing economic meeting of the global Coalition for Africa under way here in Addis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Addis Ababa - Water Resources Minister Ato Shiferaw Jarso said there is no fear that the overflowing of Awash River would flood areas neighbouring Wonji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister, member of the National Committee in charge of Disaster Prevention said strengthened efforts are being undertaken to prevent floods from damaging standing crops in Amibara, Metehara, Dubti and Assayta.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ato Shiferaw said preventive activities would be undertaken in a consolidated manner as there would not be heavy rainfalls until Wednesday (today), according to meteorological predictions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said about 30,000 people have so far been evacuated from the flooded areas including Wonji in a life-saving campaign since the Awash River burst its bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Only standing crops of two peasant localities and sugar-cane plantation on 400 hectares have so far been damaged by the floods caused by the overflow of the river, Ato Shiferaw said, adding there was no other damage or human casualty except one person whose body was found afloat on the flood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The victims of the floods were evacuated and were settled in a temporary shelter in Metehara town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amount of water released through Koka gates Sunday was 600 cubic metre and that maximum efforts are being exerted to prevent a bridge which leads to the Metehara Sugar Factory from being damaged by floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Numerous members of the national Defence Force in Awash Arba locality are making dikes to help prevent the overflow of the river, according to the minister.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, all the remaining people who have not been evacuated from areas engulfed by floods were rescued last Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a related news from Nazareth, residents of Nazareth town are building dikes around a water pump in Wonji in a bid to prevent water shortage that may result from overflow of Awash River.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Oromiya Water, Mines and Energy Bureau head, Ato Jundi Sado said the residents saved the main water pump from being damaged by floods by building protective dikes around it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He further said presently the residents of the town are being supplied with adequate water and added preventive action would be undertaken round the clock.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LUSAKA, Zambia - Opposition UNIP leader, Kenneth Kaunda, Thursday welcomed the donor economic squeeze on President Frederick Chiluba's government and urged the international community to keep up the sanctions pressure to force the government resolve the current constitutional and political impasse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are where we are now (peaceful) because of the donors who have withheld aid which continues to give hope to Zambians for a peaceful resolution of the present political and constitutional crises,&quot; Kaunda told local journalists here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said that he was ready to contribute to the search for a solution to the crises through the proposed inter-party dialogue between the opposition parties and the ruling Movement for Multiparty Democracy.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Chiluba, he revealed, had been in touch with him to arrange the proposed inter-party reconciliatory talks which, he said, should revolve on the constitution and the 1996 scheduled presidential and parliamentary elections. His only condition for attending the talks would be that they be held at a neutral venue under neutral chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am ready and willing to come (for the talks)...I am not asking any more than what Mr. Chiluba had himself asked for in 1991...it's a matter of do unto others as you would have them do unto you,&quot; said Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was referring to Chiluba's refusal to attend the 1991 constitutional talks at state house under his chairmanship. Kaunda gave in and allowed the church to preside at venues outside the seat of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda again reiterated that he would defy the new constitutional clause which bars him from standing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to say again that I will break the law and go to prison over this apartheid constitution. We fought similar constitutions in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa as a matter of principle...I will never compromise with evil,&quot; warned Kaunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, Kaunda has asked President Chiluba to dismiss Francis Ndhlovu, the inspector general of police, who he said, comprised the integrity of the police service by admitting that he had deployed unorthodox means to investigate members of UNIP who are currently charged with treason and murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ndhlovu last week told the court that he had ordered illegal tapping of &quot; Post&quot; newspaper telephone lines during investigations of the treason case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kaunda claimed that the opposition members had been charged with &quot;fake&quot; offenses as political vendetta against UNIP.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DAKAR, Senegal - United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and veteran South African freedom fighter Walter Sisulu are expected to be main speakers at a five-day forum starting September 9, in Washington, D.C.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum, organized by an African-American organisation, &quot;Constituency for Africa&quot; or CFA, will be officially named the 'Ronald H. Brown African Affairs Series' in honor of the late U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who died in a plane crash in Croatia earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The organizers said in a dispatch to PANA in Dakar Thursday the UN secretary general will give a keynote address on September 13, on 'conflict Resolution in Africa'.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Issues to be discussed under the subject will include the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the current situation in Burundi, where a military takeover occurred July 25. Trade and human rights in Nigeria, modern slavery in Africa, the US/UN intervention in Liberia and African human rights efforts will also be discussed.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Walter Sisulu will participate in a discussion on the state of democracy and status of human rights in Africa. The topic will be part of the discussion on Democracy, Human Rights and U.S Policy towards Africa with the U.S Assistant Secretary of State George Moose as one of the keynote speakers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The CFA Executive Director, Melvin Foote, said the forum will also discuss diverse issues as doing business in Africa, the culture of the African Diaspora and the modern world and the role of science and technology in African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The forum will be the second of its kind and is to be held during and in conjunction with the &quot;Congressional Black Caucus Annual Legislative week.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The goal of this series is to keep African issues and concerns on the front burner of the agenda of this country because they are as important as their domestic counterpart, particularly for African-American progress,&quot; Foote notes in the dispatch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;While the past twenty five years have witnessed unprecedented progress in the area of African African-American cooperation, more needs to be done to strengthen the links and to demonstrate how intertwined are the destinies of both peoples.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants will witness the inauguration of an award called &quot;The Constituent of the Year Award&quot; to be presented to an individual who has provided exemplary leadership and service &quot;in creating support for Africa in the United States.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CFA's focus since the organisation was founded in 1990 has been &quot;to educate the American public about Africa and African issues and to improve cooperation and coordination among a variety of organizations, groups and individuals with interest in Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">TRIPOLI, Libya - Six African presidents are expected in Tripoli within the next two days, to attend the 27th anniversary of the Libyan revolution which falls on September 1.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Officials in the Libyan capital said they are expecting presidents Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso, Idriss Deby of Chad, Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Alpha Konare of Mali, Gen. Ibrahim Mainassara Bare of Niger, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Syria's Hafez Al Assad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Highlights of the celebration, marking the accession to power of Col.  Moammar Kadhafi in 1969, will include the launching of the second phase of Libya's water supply project known as the &quot;Great Artificial River.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libyan officials said Mubarak and Assad would be visiting their country again for the first time in five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The officials have been engaged in spirited public works which include rehabilitation of the water supply system in Tripoli. Extensive work is also being carried out at the Sidi Yayah water depot, 30 km from the capital, which will be used to stock fresh water tapped from underground streams in Southern Libya, close to the border with Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Tripoli airport is also undergoing a facelift, particularly its VIP lounge, suggesting that some of the invited leaders might arrive here by plane, despite the embargo imposed on Libya by the United Nations on April 15, 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The world body alleged that Libyan secret agents were implicated in the mid- air explosion of a passenger plane over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988, and in a similar incident involving a French carrier, UTA, over Niger in 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three western countries -- Britain, France and the United States -- convinced the United Nations to impose sanctions against Libya to force it to surrender the suspected bombers for trial in London or Washington.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Libya has violated the embargo on a number of occasions. In 1995 and earlier this year, its planes flew pilgrims to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. In June this year, Col. Kadhafi flew to an Arab summit in Cairo in a Libyan aircraft.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LAGOS, Nigeria - Four West African countries - Benin, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo - have commissioned two teams of experts to speed up the execution of a 260-million-dollar gas pipeline project.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said in a statement Wednesday the &quot;teams were set up with specific tasks.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">It did not elaborate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The creation of the two standing teams was decided Tuesday in Cotonou, Benin, by oil and energy ministers of the four countries, at a meeting held to review the project launched in 1995.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The ministers requested the headquarters of the Lagos-based Economic Community of West African States to serve as the project's permanent secretariat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The teams have been asked to give a report at the next extraordinary meeting of the ministers scheduled for October in Accra, Ghana.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria's petroleum resources minister, Dan Etete, was elected chairman of the standing committees of the project designed to commercialize, within the West African sub-region, his country's surplus gas currently being flared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nigeria is expected to generate about 500 million dollars over a period of 20 years from gas sale to a number of West African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some 50 million standard cubic feet of Nigerian gas is to be supplied daily through the pipeline to solve the energy problems being faced by some countries in the sub-region.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan - The Iraqi Embassy in Khartoum has denied that its diplomats were involved in the hijacking of a Sudanese jetliner Monday, while on a scheduled flight from Khartoum to Amman, Jordan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Iraqi Ambassador, Abdul Samad Humaid, condemned the incident as &quot;a terrorist operation&quot; which ran against &quot;the values and morals of the honorable Iraqis.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has been widely reported in the international media that Iraqi diplomats were involved in the hijacking. The drama of Sudan Airways Flight 150 ended with the freeing of all 13 crew and 186 passengers, unharmed, at London's Stansted Airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">News reports described the hijackers as six armed Iraqi diplomats. On Wednesday, the International Herald Tribune, Published in Paris, cited a London police official, John Burrow, as saying that there might have been up to eight Iraqi hijackers involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Those who have circulated such lies should have referred to the list of passengers of the said flight to get the proper information on the names and profession of the passengers,&quot; Humaid said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The jet, an A300, was hijacked over Egyptian airspace. Some 142 of the passengers were Sudanese and the rest Arab nationals, the official Sudan News Agency reported Tuesday.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - Civil servants in Zimbabwe continued with their strike for higher salaries Thursday as their leaders tried to squeeze more concessions from the government which has been forced to soften its hardline stance by the 10-day work stoppage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Thousands of workers, sensing victory after the government announced it would award them a 20-percent increase, converged in larger numbers at their usual assembly points in the main cities awaiting orders from their leaders who were negotiating with the minister of the public service, labor and social welfare, Florence Chitauro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The few civil servants who had succumbed to threats of dismissal and returned to work rejoined the strike after the government softened its position, acknowledging that mistakes had been made when the majority of the civil servants got less than 10 percent in salary increases.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitauro announced Wednesday that the 161 000 civil servants would be awarded an extra 20 percent back-dated to July, saying this was part of the package the government had earlier committed itself to but which had not been effected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The government climb-down came after the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions threatened a nationwide strike unless the government resolved its dispute with the civil servants by Friday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Union leaders representing the striking workers told ZIANA Thursday morning that they had begun negotiations with Chitauro to formally present their grievances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A public sector job evaluation exercise conducted by government in 1995 found that on average, civil servants earned 172 percent less than their counterparts in the private sector, and 82 percent less than those in the country's public-owned companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We are now commencing negotiations...with a view to having the salary gap between us and our counterparts in parastatals narrowed,&quot; said one of the representatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said it was hoped they would strike a deal to ensure that the lowest paid civil servant would get a 60-percent salary hike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, they said the strike would continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fate of the 7,000 workers whom the government had said it had fired for taking part in the strike was one of the issues to be resolved before they could return to work, they said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations -- The United States &quot;strongly supports&quot; the economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by African nations, U.S. Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said in a speech to the Security Council August 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sanctions, which include cutting air links and closing borders, were imposed on July 31 by East African nations in response to a July 25 coup which replaced the elected president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following is the text of Inderfurth's statement:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 29 the Council called on the military leaders in Bujumbura &quot;to restore constitutional government and processes, including the continuation of the elected National Assembly and civil institutions and respect for human rights.&quot; Regrettably, there has been no progress toward these objectives. The leaders of the July 25 military coup d'etat in Bujumbura have taken no apparent steps to restore democracy, and the indiscriminate killings on both sides have continued.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The most recent report of the Secretary-General points alarmingly to the further worsening of the situation in Burundi and to the failure of both the civilian and military leaders either to resolve their differences or to heed clear warnings given by the Secretary-General, the Security Council, and numerous world leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States applauds the efforts of the states of the region to bring pressure to bear on the coup leaders. We will seek above all to support the objectives of Arusha in calling on the new regime to undertake immediate and unconditional negotiations with all parties inside and outside the country, to return to constitutional order and legality, to restore the National Assembly, and to unban all political parties. We also strongly support the stated intention of these states to cooperate fully with the United Nations and work toward measures aimed at avoiding a humanitarian catastrophe in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Arusha states have also imposed economic sanctions on Burundi. We strongly support this step and believe it indicates the determination of the regional states to achieve the goals I mentioned above. We hope these sanctions will convince the coup leaders that they have no alternative but to halt the fighting and initiate a political dialogue. If this does not work, the Security Council is willing to consider further action in support of cessation of hostilities, or to compel cessation of hostilities. Such action could include an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders, as the situation warrants. All sanctions must be carefully implemented to permit continued humanitarian relief so that they do not injure the already- suffering innocent civilians in this crisis-torn country. And, of course, we should stand ready to support any genuine opening to peace and dialogue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Future measures both at the United Nations and in the region must be carefully calibrated to events in Burundi. The fate of Burundi is today, more than ever, in the hands of the Burundians. We are sending a very strong message to both the present regime and insurgents inside and outside Burundi that the international community will not tolerate genocide and the threat this poses to peace and security of the Great Lakes region as a whole. All parties must commit themselves to a cessation of hostilities and a dialogue aimed at establishing a lasting cease-fire, an end to killing, and a comprehensive political settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General's report correctly observes that the conflict in Burundi is not susceptible to a military solution. The factions in Burundi must overcome their deep-seated distrust and fears in order to identify and establish an effective political mechanism for themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The U.S. commends with great appreciation the efforts of the Secretary- General and his staff; the Organization of African Unity and its Secretary- General, Salim Salim; former President Nyerere of Tanzania; the regional leaders from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire, who met in Arusha on July 31; and other representatives of the international community who have worked tirelessly to avert a further worsening of the situation in Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Secretary-General's report notes that the Secretariat has continued to facilitate contingency planning for a rapid humanitarian response to a crisis in Burundi. While we will continue to place our highest priority on promoting a peaceful solution based on political dialogue, my government welcomes finalization of the Emergency Operations Plan for Burundi, which ensures that U.N. agencies can function together to provide the maximum level of emergency assistance in the event of a serious escalation of the conflict. The United States has worked closely with the United Nations Secretariat in its two- track approach to military contingency planning, and continues to urge that other government support this effort. The international community must always allow for the possibility that the worst may happen in Burundi. The international community must avoid a replay of the horrors that befell Rwanda.  The international community must do all that it can to be ready to act if the need arises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Security Council must, therefore, take further action. To that end, we will be working with other members of the Council this week to produce a resolution that sends an unmistakable and frank message to leaders of the Burundian factions: stop the killing now and initiate an immediate dialogue.  Without timely progress toward these goals, it will be difficult to avoid a humanitarian crisis. But with progress can come a return of international support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Early this year, Pope John Paul II appointed a Canadian, Monsignor Gray, Superior General of the White Fathers as bishop of the trouble-torn Kabale Diocese in south-western Uganda, and succeeded in restoring peace to the diocese. Recently, the Anglican Archbishop of Uganda, the Most Rev. Mpalanyi Nkoyooyo appointed an American padre and medical volunteer, the Rev. Dr. Christopher George Palacas as Vicar-General of the troubled eastern diocese of Busoga, a move that has been welcomed by antagonists in the see.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are strong indications that peace could finally be restored to the trouble-torn Anglican diocese of Busoga after rival factions agreed to bury the hatchet and end a four-year rift that has paralysed pastoral and welfare activities of the Church of the Province of Uganda in this diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This follows the induction on August 14, of an American padre and medical volunteer, the Rev. Dr. Christopher George Palacas as the Vicar General of Busoga Diocese.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The bishop of the diocese, the Rt.Rev. Cyprian Bamwoze who has been on sabbatical leave will retire on February 7, 1997.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Palacas, a native of Massachussetss, United States of America, came to Uganda with his wife Jane five years ago and has been working as a volunteer with the Community Health Project of the Anglican Church in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The diocese encompasses the regional home of the Busoga, Uganda's second largest ethnic group after the Baganda in a country of some 18 million people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Observers say members of the House of Bishops of the Church of the Province of Uganda have taken a balanced decision regarding the two rival factions.  First they ordered Bishop Bamwoze, the man at the centre of the controversy to proceed on early retirement. He should have retired in 1999 on attaining age 65. Then they ordered Rev. Canon Samuel Lubogo, the self-installed bishop of the anti-Bamwoze faction, to vacate the bishop's house at Christ's Cathedral Bugembe, the headquarters of the troubled diocese. Lubogo was previously a prison chaplain and was installed by the rival group at the height of the crisis in 1974.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Furthermore, observers say by choosing a foreigner as caretaker, the archbishop has helped diffuse the seemingly endless problem, partly because each group's pride has not been violated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the three-hour service to induct the Rev. Dr. Palacas, former bitter rivals hugged and pledged to forgive each other for the many years of hatred, violence and antagonism that had characterized the upheavals in Busoga. The service was conducted by Archbishop Nkoyooyo who has been acting bishop of Busoga since the House of Bishops sent Bamwoze on sabbatical leave last year.  &quot;This is God's intervention, not human achievement,&quot; said Canon William Magambo, the Church of Uganda provincial secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But despite the unprecedented return to the spirit of reconciliation, there is still simmering tension beneath. For example, during the induction service, the archbishop stated that Bishop Bamwoze was still free to confer sacraments of his church but a section of the congregation booed this suggestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the meantime as Bishop Bamwoze prepares for full retirement, Rev. Canon Lubogo has already vacated the bishop's house and relocated to a furnished flat in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. He is officially on leave pending a decision about his fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The lay leaders whom he purported to ordain deacons will be defrocked since Lubogo was not an ordained bishop in conformity with the practice of Anglicans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The four-year crisis in Busoga was a sorry chapter for the whole Anglican Church in Uganda. Rival factions threatened to secede a number of times in the hope of swaying the House of Bishops to their line of thought. Indeed, former Archbishop Yona Okoth angrily told the anti-Bamwoze faction: &quot;You can secede if you wish since you have failed to operate within the accepted practice of your church.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The problem in Busoga reached a climax in August 1992 when the influential Dean of Busoga the Rev. Canon James Zikusooka, tendered his resignation to Bishop Bamwoze, stating a number of reasons for his actions, including accusations of financial mismanagement and poor pastoral management of diocesan affairs. Others charged the bishop had very poor communication skills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Matters took a new turn by September when 1,500 anti-Bamwoze Christians passed a constitutionally invalid &quot;vote of no confidence&quot; in their bishop.  They then proceeded to lock out the bishop from Christ's Cathedral in Bugembe and a number of other parishes. Bishop Bamwoze was out of the country at the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This state of affairs did not please the House of Bishops who in February 1993 issued a statement affirming that Cyprian Bamwoze &quot;is the rightful Bishop of Busoga Diocese.&quot; The House of Bishops established a four-man committee to look into the affairs of the troubled diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unfortunately, as matters deteriorated, Bishop Bamwoze was not ready for reconciliation. Previously accused of arrogance by his detractors, Bamwoze issued a statement in January 1993, scoffing at moves to dethrone him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said he had no time for &quot;such minor issues as his was a busy office.&quot; He would not defend himself under duress. He was quoted saying that as a bishop, he was &quot;not desperate for support from those below or above him.&quot; Not surprisingly, a member of the steering committee against Bishop Bamwoze, a Mr.  Naigere commented: &quot;the bishop has fanned his current predicament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Clearly, by belittling very influential people from his own Basoga community, he was only helping to fan the fire against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Rev. Canon James Zikusooka, whose resignation as dean sparked the crisis, is a retired engineer and a former cabinet minister. He is currently head of Uganda's Public Service Commission. The late D.K. Nabeta, a former Ugandan ambassador to France, also worked ceaselessly for Bishop Bamwoze's downfall. His own brother, the Rev. T.T.T. Nabeta, should have been bishop but turned down the offer of appointment, citing lack of sufficient experience to manage the affairs of the diocese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Paul Waibale Senior, a Ugandan journalist whose own father was a churchman in Busoga for many years, says the task ahead for a peacemaker like Rev. Dr.  Palacas &quot;is a formidable one&quot; that demands patience, courage, determination and prayers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Nearly two decades ago, the people of a fertile region in south- western Kenya celebrated the government's promise of bringing them instant wealth through a factory and money minting cash crop, sugar-cane. But today, the eldorado has turned into a mirage as residents helplessly watch their unharvested cane go to waste, not to mention the environmental disaster and economic nightmare they have had to cope with over the years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Seated under a giant mango tree in the middle of his homestead, retired civil servant Ogola Omolo reflects on his glorious past, hostile present and uncertain future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">His two grandchildren are playing lethargically nearby. They are hardly eight years but old enough to go to school although they are not doing so.  With a sigh of frustration and despondency, he looks at his ten acres of over- mature sugar-cane crop. &quot;I invested all my worldly wealth in this cane, but it is now going to waste,&quot; laments Omolo.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The withering cane is almost six months past harvesting time. On the other side of the river overlooking Omolo's homestead stands the imposing South Nyanza (SONY) sugar factory. &quot;This monster is my undoing. Before its arrival here I was a respectable man easily managing my affairs. But look what it has reduced me to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ogola Omolo is one of the hundreds of thousands of farmers who subscribe to the Sony sugar company at Awendo, a fast-growing township in the fertile south-western region of Kenya, some 600 kilometres west of the capital, Nairobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before 1977, the half-a-million residents of this extremely arable land of 50,000 square kilometres were a happy and complacent lot. They enjoyed ample rainfall almost throughout the year owing to the relief and rich natural vegetation, most of it indigenous forests. They therefore grew enough crops, some of which doubled as cash crops, for food and other requirements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They must have been overjoyed when the government announced just before 1977 the introduction of another crop that would instantly change their lives -- sugar cane. The sugar factory would be a fountain of cash to them, they were promised, and it would employ all their children after school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents therefore welcomed the development project with open arms.  Those affected by the project's nucleus estate willingly accepted to be moved out, although the government was despicably skimpy in its compensation for the acquired land and any development on it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The people who had hitherto lived in tightly knit community set-ups were displaced. To minimize scattering, they were absorbed by their kinsfolk who were lucky enough to escape the nucleus dragnet. The land shrank considerably for those who would be the factory's out- growers to supplement its nucleus estate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The monetary compensation was really not much but it was enough to send a good number of the beneficiaries mad, as most of them had not handled so much money before. It further enriched those who were already rich and further impoverished the less well-to-do. Most of the beneficiaries went into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">unnecessary spending sprees and spared no money for alternative land. Such people now live in Awendo either as squatters or at the Sony labour camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is two decades since and the local people from the project have to bear the brunt of the side-effects of a poorly conceived and executed development undertaking.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says David Okeyo, an out-grower like Omolo; &quot;If this is what development is, then let the government keep it to the urban centres and leave the rural folks alone.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Before the establishment of Sony, the people lived in primitive bliss.  Although they did not have so much money, they eked a living out of the many acres of land each owned. The land provided their daily food needs, pasture for their cattle, cooking fuel and a home. The women's search for fuelwood only ended a short distance from the homestead, thanks to the rich natural forest cover.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But today, cooking and house heating fuel is a thorny issue for the residents of Awendo. Years back, they were sweet-talked into clearing these forests to give way to the sugar-cane plantations. But today, firewood is a scarce commodity, notwithstanding the concerted agro-forestry efforts of the Ministries of Environment and Natural Resources, Culture and Social Services and the work of many women's groups and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The fuel problem is compounded by the high costs of such alternatives as kerosene which sells for Shs.25 (about 50 US cents) per litre, yet an average household uses about two litres a day. An average Sony worker earns Shs.2,500 (US dollars 50) per month. Alternatives like petroleum gas or electricity are out of reach for these people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The agro-forestry efforts would have achieved some success, had it not been for a recent phenomenon -- the arrival of the multi- national, British- American Tobacco Company (BAT) on the scene. Apart from competing for land with the sugar industry, tobacco consumes a lot of fuelwood during its smoke- drying stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although a BAT leaf officer recently told a farmers' meeting that his company would do everything in its powers to promote agro- forestry alongside tobacco, the situation continues to deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The residents' hopes for their children's employment have not been fulfilled either. Sony has a permanent workforce of about 2,000 and about 3, 000 casuals. But of the permanent staff, only about a tenth come from Awendo.  Most of the casuals are transported in trucks from far-flung places in the morning and back in the evening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Says George Bolo, the supervisor of one of the many weeding groups; &quot;We prefer those from faraway places because they demand less pay. The locals gripe that they were short-changed during displacement and therefore deserve better payment for their labour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But a factory personnel official argues; &quot;We employ purely on merit and not according to where the applicant comes from. Giving the locals the priority is against government policy. We have no quota system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The executive chairman who hails from the Awendo area laments: &quot;The local people prefer to work in faraway places to avoid constant pestering by their extended families for cash assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most of the inputs during cultivation are provided by the company because of the farmers' poverty. Sony also accesses to the farmer transportation of the harvested cane to the factory and cash advances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for labour. But the bills charged for the services mean that the farmer ends up earning very little at the first harvest. Occasionally, one ends up with a heavy debt which can be recovered at the harvest of the first ratoon (regrowth).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the situation has now become desperate for the farmers. Owing to rampant corruption and mismanagement on the part of the company and the effects of liberalization as prescribed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cane is hardly ever harvested.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kenya's economic liberalization policy has brought about uncontrolled importation of sugar by well connected businessmen. Since the import is cheaper, the locally produced sugar hardly moves. Thus, as is the case with the other half-a-dozen sugar factories in the country, Sony stores are choking with stagnant stock. The factory's frustration is passed onto the farmer whose crop has to vegetate and rot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the factories' hue and cry over the unrestrained importation of sugar and representations to the government for action, the situation is far from improved. This is why sometimes Sony cannot afford to harvest ready cane, and the farmer has to watch in utter disgust and frustration as his crop goes to waste.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - A major stand-off has developed in South Africa between the country's security forces and a Muslim fundamentalist group following the murder by the militants of a feared gang leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The murder has been condemned by the government, including President Nelson Mandela himself and retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, but other groups and the Muslims blame it on impatience with police and judicial inability to combat crime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Muslims have since threatened to declare a Jihad over the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The incident was sparked when about 2,000 members of the militant Muslim group, People Against Gangs and Drugs (PAGAD) arrived at the house of Hard Living gang leader Rashaad Staggie in Salt River mixed race township near Cape Town on the night of August 4 in a motorcade of at least 500 vehicles, witnesses said</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Hard Living gang is regarded as the most vicious of the drug-dealing gangs in the Cape Flats area, where most of Cape Town's mixed-race and black townships are situated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said that Staggie arrived home to find his house surrounded.  Sitting in his vehicle, he raised his hands to show he was not armed, but someone shot him in the head at point blank range and dragged him out.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As paramedics tried to attend to him, someone threw a petrol bomb which exploded and set him alight, driving the paramedics back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He then managed to stagger to his feet and run a few paces before others in the mob pushed him over and emptied more bullets into him. Some PAGAD members kicked his corpse as he lay in the gutter, witnesses said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The attack and subsequent murder of Staggie, the well-known drug and gang leader, was committed in front of police and a large crowd of residents. At lease 18 people, including a journalist, were also injured during the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Condemning the killing, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, former head of the Anglican Church in South Africa, said citizens should not take the law into their own hands. &quot;That way lies chaos and anarchy. It reinforces the old adage: 'Two wrongs do not make a right,'&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South African President Nelson Mandela and Justice Minister Dullah Omar also lashed out the next day at the militant Muslim vigilante group, warning that problems linked to crime, drug trafficking and gangs could not be solved by people taking the law into their own hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Arresting criminals, investigating their cases and bringing them in court is the function and responsibility of the police,&quot; Omar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, Western Cape provincial premier Hernus Kriel called for an inquiry into the killing, saying he had sympathy and understanding with the people's frustration which, he said &quot;followed on the obvious inability of the judicial and police system to handle such problems.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Political opposition parties and human rights groups, meanwhile, said the mob execution was an indictment of the inability of the police and the justice system to deal effectively with South Africa's runaway crime rate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The liberal Democratic Party (DP) also condemned the killing, but pointed out that it was an indication that the community was sick of rampant crime, gangsterism, police inability to nail criminals and ineffective courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent Lawyers for Human Rights (LHR) condemned the vigilantism but said it was an expression of a much larger problem. &quot;That the frustrations of these communities have boiled over into violence is not unexpected, in view of the commonly-held perception that gangsters operate with impunity,&quot; LHR said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police spokesman Senior Superintendent John Sterrenberg predicted an all- out war between PAGAD and the gangsters. &quot;I shudder to think of the repercussions of this thing,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police had been at the scene of the mob execution but were unable to prevent the killing because when they tried to take action, they were cut off by the crowd, Sterrenberg said, adding that even if there had been 14,000 policemen at the scene &quot;we could not have done anything.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But the Muslim leaders remained defiant, and instead warned of suicide bombings and a &quot;holy war&quot; against drug dealers and gangsters following the weekend mob execution of the feared Cape Town gang leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mohammed Ali Parker, military leader of the PAGAD militant group which carried out the execution, was reported saying that he had no regrets about the operation. &quot;The blood-letting was actually very helpful. In my mind it strengthens our cause. The war will be intensified. It marked the start of a Jihad (holy war),&quot; said Parker, who was shot in the chest during the fire fight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;All the signs are there. Each soldier of Allah is equivalent to 5,000 gangsters. &quot;We are clean, God-loving people, and we are not afraid to die,&quot; vowed Parker, warning gangsters and drug dealers: &quot;If they are not going to listen then I will pack myself full of explosives and pay somebody a visit.  Then they will know.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On the other hand, residents of Salt River also spoke fearfully of the killings, telling journalists that Staggie was a Robin Hood figure in the area, and often gave money to poor people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;He gave us money for sweets or anything,&quot; said a 10-year-old boy, recalling that shortly before he was killed, Staggie gave him a ten rand note (about 2 dollars.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to Prof. Wildred Scharf, director of the University of Cape Town's Institute of Criminology, the deceased gangster and his twin brother, Rashied, used generosity to buy silence from the community. &quot;All gangs have to buy silence, and the Staggies were particularly creative in this,&quot; Scharf added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">One woman said the Muslim vigilantes had killed the less evil of the Staggie twins: &quot;Rashied is the dangerous one, Rashaad was a gentleman,&quot; she observed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rashaad himself told a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) interviewer in 1993 that Rashied was the violent one. &quot;He likes the power. I like the money,&quot; he was quoted saying.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I am the only one who can get into Rashied's mind,&quot; he said. &quot;He is a psychopath, a real killer. If I go away, Rashied is in big trouble.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes followed recent reports of growing secret cells of foreign- trained Muslim militants operating in South Africa's Western Cape province and in the eastern city of Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The clashes followed recent reports of growing secret cells of foreign- trained Muslim militants operating in South Africa's Western Cape province and in the eastern city of Durban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A senior government source said on August 6 that the cells were discovered by South Africa's secret service after an Israeli newspaper claimed in April that fundamentalists of the Muslim Hizbollah movement were training militants at five bases inside South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Public South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) radio quoted an unnamed PAGAD leader as saying some members of the group had received military training in Middle Eastern countries, especially Libya, but the Libyan ambassador to South Africa, Abdullah al- Zubeida, denied his country's link with PAGAD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Despite the efforts to contain the looming struggle, security officials still believe that Muslim extremists remained the biggest threat to internal security, with police spokesman Reg Crewe confirming that militant Islamic extremist cells had been set up in various parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said police investigations have reportedly revealed the existence of Islamic cells in several major cities, including Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban and Port Elizabeth and also identified names of cell leaders, where military training is being given, where they got their weapons from and what contact they have had with international groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He named Qibla, an organization operating in Western Cape province, as the most extreme of the groups, saying that some of its members have been trained in Libya and Pakistan while others fought alongside the Hizbollah movement in Lebanon against Israel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Muslim analyst Lqbal Jhazbhay pointed out, however, that although the recent emergence of a popular and well-armed Muslim-based movement threatening religious war on crime in Western Cape province has surprised most South Africans, Islamic militancy has been around in the country for some time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The majority of South African Muslims, believed to number between 500,000 and a million, live in Cape Town with smaller communities in the eastern port of Durban and the commercial centre of Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PAGAD's Cape Town support base consists mainly of descendants of Malaysian and Indonesian slaves who were brought to the Cape colony in the 18th century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under the segregationist policies of the apartheid regime, they were designated &quot;coloureds&quot; -- people of mixed race origin -- and denied significant political representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, along with the former white minority government's restrictive Protestant doctrine that tolerated but did not encourage the growth of other faiths, drove many Muslim leaders to the anti-apartheid struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Having played a key role in the overthrow of apartheid, particularly as intellectuals and strategists in the African National Congress (ANC) and the radical Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), Muslim political figures were rewarded in the new democratic era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Their presence in parliament, where they constitute 16 per cent of the members, is out of all proportion to the Muslim population of a little over one per cent of the 42 million South Africans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Four members of government are Muslims, three of them in President Mandela's 25-member cabinet, including Dullah Omar who is responsible for the key Justice portfolio.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ebrahim Rasool, who is now an ANC member and the provincial Minister for Health in the Western Cape, founded the &quot;Call to Islam&quot; in 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ahmed Cassim, a former PAC activist who spent time in the notorious Robben Island prison for his anti-apartheid efforts, founded &quot;Al Qibla&quot; a more radical group that recruited South African Muslims to fight in the civil war in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">More recently, Al Quibla hosted the controversial visit to South Africa of d'Anouar Haddam, a leader of Algeria's banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which provoked a mini-diplomatic crisis with some Arab states.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - The new head of the International Affairs Desk of the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) has challenged churches in Africa to continue to work for peace and reconciliation, stressing that issues pertaining to lack of respect for human rights and democracy continue to affect the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zairean clergy, Rev. Daniel Ngoy-Mulunda said the situation prevailing in Africa should encourage churches there to redouble their efforts towards peace and reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Issues pertaining to lack of human rights, democracy and civil strife, among others that are currently affecting thousands of people on the continent, should encourage us as churches to continue with our mission of reconciliation and peace promotion,&quot; Rev. Mulunda told APS in an interview here on August 22.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a document, put out by the International Affairs desk entitled, Proposed Initiatives, Rev. Ngoy, says a major problem confronting the aspiring democratic society centres on the tension between conflict and consent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;When national political leaders fail to reach an agreement when all institutional channels are incapacitated, the churches will be called upon to offer conflict resolution strategies,&quot; observes Rev. Mulunda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The changing situation in Africa calls for the AACC and in particular, the International Affairs Desk, to play a sentinel role, reading the signs of the time, warning the churches--as in the days of Ezekiel (33:1-9), equipping them and working with them for the establishment of God's kingdom on the continent of Africa, says the document.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the peacemaking and conflict resolution, the promotion of forgiveness and reconciliation constitutes the primary challenge confronting the African church, Rev. Mulunda stressed, adding...&quot;the achievement of forgiveness and reconciliation remains the central challenge in the context of the Rwanda genocide.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC describes both forgiveness and reconciliation as theological concepts, whose common sharing and understanding is critical to their effective deployment by the church. If misunderstood, such concepts can by themselves become the source of conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On injustice and justice, the desk's document says the church will increasingly be engaged with people who are accused of meting out injustice, fostering oppression and abusing human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On ethnicity and nationalism, the document says ethnic conflict has been identified as one of the most destructive elements on the African continent.  &quot;In this regard, Christian churches are not immune. In many situations across the continent, churches and political parties work from some ethnic base. It is precisely under these circumstances that the church is called upon to promote peace and reconciliation,&quot; it explains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On peace and reconciliation, the desk in its efforts to provide an ecumenical umbrella for conflict resolution in Africa, will engage the collaboration, cooperation and support of the Geneva-based World Council of Churches (WCC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Regarding the resolution of existing conflicts, the AACC desk intends to organize various programmes and priority countries will include Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire, Sudan, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And on skills in conflict resolution, the department will organize training for church leaders in countries of conflict &quot;so that they can be equipped to deal with conflicts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human rights, says the AACC International Affairs desk, will be part of the church curriculum, it must become part of Christian education programmes. The training of Christian educators must be linked to Christian faith, thus emphasizing the theological basis for human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Rev. Mulunda, first joined the AACC in September 1988 as a Youth Programme Secretary. He recently graduated from the Wesley Theological Seminary and School of International Service of the American University, United States where he majored in Theological Studies and International Peace and Conflict Resolution respectively.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - As the unfolding peace process takes shape in Angola, the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), acknowledging Angolans' hope for a better tomorrow, has appealed to international ecumenical partners, donors and churches in Africa, to help the people of this war torn country realise the opportunity for peace that God has granted them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC appeal comes following a visit to Angola by the Executive Secretary for the organization's Youth Department, Mr. Khepi Shole. The officer was hosted by the Council of Churches in Angola from July 29 to August 6 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And as the continental umbrella of churches reported on the situation of Angola, torn apart by more than two decades of civil war, former Angolan rebel movement, the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), on August 20 opened a special congress in the central town of Bailundo which will among other things decide the future of its leader, Jonas Savimbi.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Among the new problems of the post-civil war (post-1992) period that last week's meeting was expected to resolve, is whether the UNITA leader should accept Luanda's offer for vice-presidency in a government of unity and reconciliation to be formed under the November 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AACC visit to Angola, which Mr. Shole described as both heartbreaking and educating, exposes human beings who have been reduced to endangered wild life in the middle of a devastating drought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is only in Angola that I witnessed the total destruction of social fabrics of communities, which now have to start with absolute-nothing to bring new meaning of life,&quot; Shole said in a statement issued here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Saying that the destruction of the Angolan community reflects very clearly that the civil war was sufficiently sponsored by the world's richest countries, the AACC Youth Secretary highlights problems facing the youth, most of whom were born within the war period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He notes that while young people are on waiting lists in Luanda for further tertiary studies, most families do not have any kind of income to send their children to school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shole says of the rural areas, the learning environment is totally not conducive for any learning process, a reality that is well reflected in the shortage and conditions of schools, overcrowding, too many children out of school and inadequate learning material.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Angola faces one major headache---demobilised soldiers. The AACC youth secretary reports on demobilised soldiers flocking to churches for assistance in the hope of helping themselves in the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Are we going to lose this generation of the youth....?&quot;poses Shole. And adds, &quot;our failure to provide any assistance to them will determine the undesirable future for Angola and will put the peace process on a very turbulent process.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that most of the demobilised soldiers were born within the civil war period, the AACC staff underscores the fact that these young people have never known any situation outside the fighting. For them, a gun provides a job, security and status, and what they need is not hand-outs but self- sustaining assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On leadership development, Mr. Shole compares the community of hatred, conflict and intolerance portrayed by the war situation to one of tolerance, reconciliation and trust, which must emerge if the healing process in Angola is to bear fruit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notes the AACC staffer, the war marginalised Angola for many years, denying the youth the opportunity to be part of the global, continental and even national ecumenical experiences that other youth in other countries benefitted so much from.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He says the Angolan youth are determined to learn from other young people's experiences and build their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Shole adds, although a large part of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are providing hand-outs such as food and medicine, these, albeit really helpful, are not self-sustaining.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampala - The Mufti of Uganda -- the leader of Muslims in the country -- has warned of a new plan by Islamic fundamentalists to wage war on the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheikh Saad Ibrahim Luwemba who is also Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's personal friend, decried the misuse of religion by people &quot;who are disguising themselves as missionaries, yet their real goal is politics.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He alerted the State saying he had received numerous reports that hundreds of fundamentalist-leaning Tabliq youths had been recruited and were receiving training in a country he did not disclose, but believed to be Iran or Sudan.  Tabliqs are a militant ultra conservative Muslim sect.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Mufti reminded the people of Uganda of an incident in 1994 when hundreds of Tabliq youth were caught training in a forested area of north- western Uganda. Many were killed or captured when the Uganda People's Defence Force attacked their hideout. Some escaped across Lake Albert into Zaire and have formed the core of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), whose majority members are former President Idi Amin's supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said Sheikh Saad Luwemba: &quot;I remember having warned the government that there were people poised to wage war here and you saw what happened in Buseruka (western Uganda). I therefore warn you that these people have reorganized to cause more chaos.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sheikh Saad urged Muslims to give the government full support so that peace and development can continue in Uganda after years of civil strife. He made the comments at a mosque in Central Uganda on August 14, during prayers commemorating the reign of a Muslim King, Kabaka Noah Kalema of the Baganda people, Uganda's largest ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">King Noah Kalema's reign was short-lived but he is remembered for the promotion of Islam in Uganda. He died in the 1880s at the height of political and religious conflicts in Uganda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has previously warned the Tabliq sect to respect the laws of the land following the vicious killing of policemen outside a mosque in Kampala in the early 90s.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - In an impassioned appeal for peace in Burundi, Liberia, Somalia, Sudan, Rwanda, Western Sahara and other troubled spots in the world, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has called for a national political order that enables all individuals to enjoy full human rights, including the fundamental democratic right to chose and reject governments in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Zimbabwean leader emphasized the government's need for the spiritual vision of churches to steer a straight course and called for solidarity between the Church and the State, saying governments alone cannot achieve any of their social targets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He was speaking at the Catholic Bishops Conference on Social Thought and Action of the Church in English and Portuguese-speaking Africa which was held here at the beginning of August.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The conference was attended by about 60 bishops and members from the outspoken and influential</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Catholic justice and peace organizations and was hosted by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace together with the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pointing out that problems could be created by governments and dictatorships, President Mugabe said, if solidarity is to be realised between the Church and State, it is most important that the latter recognizes the former as an equal, if not superior partner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;But we have to go beyond peace, and for its own survival and our own, create politically and economically sustainable environments that will outlaw, for all time, dictatorships, tyrannies and other politically oppressive systems, for the greater joy and hope of man in our society,&quot; President Mugabe advised.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He observed that governments are only a political creature with temporary authority, regulating the lives of citizens, including bishops and church followers, whom those authorities sometimes unjustly harassed, arrested and incarcerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mugabe said the power wielded by the government is however ephemeral and short-lived but the power and strength of the Church, being spiritual, is more enduring.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Head of State voiced his conviction that governments should be guided by certain Christian or ethical and humanitarian principles as well as common societal interests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He noted that a government whose policies are reinforced by Christian or moral values, is more enriched and a powerful force for the attainment of a society or nation whose members are bound by a system of moral values.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On social morals, Mugabe said the acceptance of the sanctity of marriage, bonds of love or true friendships in neighbourhoods and communities, reduce conflict and even thefts and robberies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Both the government and Church should continually appraise the prevailing situation in society in order to assess the needs of the times. Common objectives mean that the two institutions should share strategies on problems that demand common programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The recognition of a common bond between them (Church and State) should thus enable the two partners to forge efficient and effective partnerships in the humanity of all to the greater glory of God...,&quot; he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">President Mugabe also commended the youth for the important role they had played in the national liberation struggles of many African countries. In many political struggles for freedom from oppression and human rights, the youth had always been the forerunners of political movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christian discipline of the youth through the teaching and example of the family, school and Church, would result in the uprightness of the young people, thereby lessening juvenile delinquency, drunkenness, drug addiction and crime, noted the Zimbabwean leader.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nairobi - Newly appointed Anglican Provost of Nairobi's All Saints Cathedral has condemned land grabbing and corruption and urged Christians to set a good example in practising justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Giving his maiden sermon at the cathedral on August 18, Church of the Province of Kenya (CPK) Ven. Canon Peter Njoka quoted the biblical prophet Amos who stood for justice that went beyond barriers. Justice he said, does not discriminate between the poor and the rich or the old and young.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He wondered why the poor man should lose his land to the rich man just because the rich are capable of using the courts which also have become unfair dispensers of justice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Everyone, he said, should receive what they deserve for their actions regardless of their station in life, and only then will justice flow like a never failing stream. He said the present day Kenya was not different from the eighth century BC Israel when Amos prophesied: &quot;And the words of Amos are still speaking to us today, Kenya is peaceful and business can be done peacefully but we need to see God as overall head and submit to Him even as we express justice. Only then will justice roll down like a flood to us,&quot; noted the new provost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Ven. Canon Njoka was appointed the tenth provost of All Saints Cathedral on July 25, 1996, succeeding the Very Rev.Peter Njenga who was elevated to be the fourth Diocesan Bishop of Mt.Kenya South.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Born 51 years ago in Kagaari in Embu District, Eastern Province, the new provost attended local primary and secondary schools and trained as a teacher at St. Mark's College Embu. He taught in several primary schools upto 1975 when he resigned to study theology at the St. Paul's United Theological College, Limuru. He attained a Makerere University Diploma in Theology and a Licentiate in Theology in 1978.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He later on studied for a bachelor's degree in Bible and Christian Ministries specializing in biblical interpretation and application at the Daystar University. Between 1983 and 1984 he attained a certificate in ecumenical studies from the Bossey Institute in Switzerland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canon Njoka was made deacon on December 3, 1978 and served as a curate at St. Stephen's Church Jogoo Road, Nairobi. He became priest on December 9, 1979, serving in the same parish and later on at St. Mary's Kabete Parish. He has also served the parishes of St. Mark's Westlands, St. Barthlomew Church and St. John's Pumwani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He has served as a canon of the diocese of Nairobi since 1982 and as a Rural Dean since 1987. In 1995, he was elevated to be Archdeacon of St.  John's Pumwani.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Canon Njoka is married to Pauline Wanjiku and they have three children. He will be inducted to his new position on September 22, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kampala - As a follow-up to the 1995 United Nations Women's Conference held in Beijing, China, Uganda will host the first African conference on the girl- child and the education of women from September 8 to 13 this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The theme of the conference in the Ugandan capital will be, Empowering women through functional literacy and the education of the girl-child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The six-day meeting will attract national policy makers in the area of women's education and gender development programmes on the African continent.  Some 300 participants are expected at the meeting sponsored by the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Ugandan government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A key area of discussion will be gender sensitive curricula and teaching methods. Other aspects include the security and health of the girl-child and young women in the course of their education. For example, sanitary facilities which are lacking in many girls' schools in Africa will also be an item of concern for the conference participants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sam Onen, a technical consultant for the conference said the forum will serve as one of the many approaches to help sensitize communities and policy makers on the vital role of educating women in the development process of any nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The goal of the conference is to enhance the status of women in Africa through promotion of functional literacy and girls' education, thus achieving gender equity in development. The conference is expected to sign a &quot;Kampala Declaration&quot; on the advancement of women with viable and attainable commitments on girls' and womens' education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Meanwhile, a recent survey in Kampala has shown that affirmative action and policies introduced in Uganda since 1990 have substantially increased the number of girls in schools and colleges of higher learning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For example, girls now constitute 33 per cent of the enrolment at Makerere University up from 25 per cent six years ago.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Cairo - Egyptian security forces have arrested a total of 69 people following a series of raids by suspected Muslim fundamentalists on jewelry shops in southern Egypt that left two Coptic</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Christians dead, police sources announced here on August 18.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The arrests took place around the town of Tima, 455 kilometres south of Cairo, and five Islamic militants were seized in the town's cemetery after the raids on four jewellers in the nearby town of Tahta late August 17, they said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Three armed groups of militants launched simultaneous raids against three jewellers' shops in the same road in Tahta, shooting dead two jewellers and injuring three other people, police said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They killed two Coptic Christians, Metri Atta Ateya and Safwat Shafiq, and injured three other people, including a six-year-old Coptic boy and a Muslim engineer, hit by bullets as the gang made their escape in a hijacked lorry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The group then attacked a fourth jewellery shop in Tahta without causing casualties, police said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Witnesses said that security guards hired to guard the main street in Tahta, which contains dozens of jewellery shops, fled when they heard gunfire from the militants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police said the attackers were from Egypt's main armed Islamic militant group, the Jamaa Islamiyya, and that they escaped with 10 kilogrammes of gold and 15,000 Egyptian pounds ($4,500).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to police officials, Islamic militants had now turned to armed robbery to fill their depleted coffers and buy weapons after the government successfully cut off their flow of funds from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jamaa Islamiyya, has recently struck repeatedly against jewellery shops and banks in southern Egypt over the past month, leaving behind a trail of bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On August 5, two people including a bank employee were killed and three others were seriously wounded in a raid against a branch of the state-run Misr Bank in the village of Aayat, 50 kilometres south of Cairo, with the attackers walking away with 400,000 pounds ($118,000).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The Ministry of the Interior has almost succeeded in stopping funds from reaching the fundamentalists from abroad, thanks to a string of accords struck with several countries,&quot; a police official, who requested anonymity said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Deprived of funds, the armed fundamentalists have launched a campaign of robberies to buy weapons and they have carried out their raids in several regions to weaken the efficiency of the security services,&quot; the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Two groups of commandos, comprising six militants each, have been set up to carry out hold-ups, with one group working in the northern region of south Egypt (Minya and Beni Suef), while the other group was in charge of armed robberies in Assyut and Sohag, further south, the official said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Islamic militants have committed five armed robberies since April in banks and jewellery shops in the regions of Minya and Beni Suef, during which six people including four Coptic Christians were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The latest robberies have shown a serious gap in the security systems of banks and jewellery shops in some areas of southern Egypt, despite measures taken to face such situations,&quot; the police official added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Minya and Beni Suef, measures have included banning traffic in streets where banks and jewellery shops are located and ordering these establishments to close one hour before sunset.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Jamaa militants raid jewellery shops owned by Coptic Christians because they consider them</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;impious&quot; and therefore believe that robbing them is legal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The latest deaths brought to 1,047 the number of people killed since a wave of Islamic militant violence was unleashed in Egypt in March 1992, according to data compiled from police statements.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algiers - The Algerian government has strongly denied a press report alleging that Islamic fundamentalists had slit the throats of 63 civilians, including pensioners and children, saying the Arab newspaper that carried it was trying to spread anxiety and support terrorism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The London-based Arab daily Al-Hayat reported on August 19 that armed Islamic militants had cut the throats of 63 people including women, old people and children, in the worst attack on civilians since political violence erupted in Algeria in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The claim was &quot;devoid of all basis in fact,&quot; the Algerian Interior Ministry said and accused the newspaper, distributed in Arab and Western capitals, of &quot; seeking to sow strife and spread anxiety among public opinion.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The newspaper had &quot;but one objective: to support avowed terrorism come what may,&quot; the ministry statement charged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report had claimed that the massacre occurred on August 17 south-east of Algiers on a road between M'Sila and Batna. Batna is the birthplace of Algerian President Liamine Zeroual, whose regime the fundamentalists want to overthrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mountainous region, where several Islamic underground forces are based, voted overwhelmingly in favour of Zeroual in the presidential polls in November.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Algerian government has already reacted sharply to a report in Al-Hayat at the beginning of this month, claiming that French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette had escaped an assassination attempt during an official visit to Algiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Hayat claimed that in the latest incident, some 100 militants armed with hunting rifles, daggers and axes, set up a false roadblock and stopped two buses packed with civilians, and after checking their identity cards, &quot;they cut the throats of all the passengers from Batna, including women, the elderly and children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Batna residents were earlier reported as having said that they had heard of a massacre, but it later turned out to refer to another incident elsewhere on August 15 when 17 young people were killed, 200 kilometres south of the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Al-Hayat quoted Algerian sources as saying that the aim of the massacre was to target inhabitants from a specific region to provoke unrest between various tribes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Civilians have been targeted in several attacks along Algeria's roads in the past months during the violence which first erupted in the country in January 1992 after the cancellation of elections which the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win, and has since left up to 50,000 people dead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zeroual has opened negotiations with most of the political parties ahead of a national conference to resolve the country's political future. The conference, from which FIS has been excluded, is due to take place by the end of the summer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Algerian authorities have repeatedly insisted that they have tracked the problem of terrorism and that the militants are on the run and stripped of popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Late on August 18, state television broadcast a list of telephone numbers and a plea to denounce those belonging to armed groups, showing a series of images of militant violence and attacks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Kisumu, Kenya - The gender imbalance in the church leadership the world over will soon be a thing of the past, if a recent church convention here is anything to go by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Participants at an international convention of women pastors at Kisumu Polytechnic here, some 360 kilometres north-west of the capital, Nairobi resolved that the higher ratio of men to their women counterparts in church leadership must be rectified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The participants, all women pastors, called on the leaderships of all church organizations in the world to ordain more women priests, arguing that women can make as good ministers as their male counterparts.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">At the climax of the August 14 to 17 convention, over 5,000 faithful witnessed the ordination of 100 women priests at Kisumu's Moi Stadium. The function was presided over by church leaders from the United States and brought together women priests and clerics from the US, Russia, Australia, Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The convention was organized by women from the Voice of Salvation and Healing Church in Eastern Africa in collaboration with the US- based International Gospel Centre (IGC). The ordination ceremony was conducted by the head of the church, the Rev. Silas Owiti, assisted by the Rev. Dr.  Ladonna Osborne and the Rev. Dr. Chyama Anthony, both from the International Gospel Centre. Dr. Osborne is a daughter of Dr. T.L. Osborne, also of the IGC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the ordination ceremony, Dr. Ladonna Osborne told the gathering: &quot; Discrimination against women in the church must be a thing of the past,&quot; and called for a proper interpretation of the Bible. She said the Bible is &quot;the foundation of our faith, but tradition and culture are not always Bible-based and should not be a basis for the discrimination against women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Kenya needs strong women in the church, politics and education to get rid of such vices as prostitution which come about because of the bias.&quot; Dr.  Osborne noted that from the first century, church tradition has placed women below men, &quot;but this is against God's will. The world is shrinking apace due to technological development, so once one country starts discussing one issue, the others will follow suit: change is thus inevitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The secretary-general of the Voice of Salvation and Healing church, Mrs Winnie Owiti, said women are the best soul winners and should be given a chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Earlier in the previous sessions of the convention, Mrs. Owiti had told the participants that it is unbelievable that a male priest is expected to lead a congregation of over 4,00 women, none of whom is a priest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During one of the sessions, the participants called on the church leaders to step up the war against evil in society. They called upon the Church to exploit the freedom of worship, as guaranteed by the Kenyan constitution to fight evil without fear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said the pastors: &quot;The world is currently reeling under the weight of immorality, and this must be curbed spiritually.&quot; And they warned political leaders against oppressing the weak in society. &quot;When the weak are oppressed, God will always avenge this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dr. Osborne called upon mothers not to leave all the household chores to the girls, arguing that this makes girls feel inferior and the boys superior.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harare - The National Gallery of Zimbabwe will submit recommendations to the government to prevent works of art leaving the country before they have been referred to the gallery or before it has been given the right of first refusal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The move is meant to curb the loss of some of the best cultural and artistic works from being siphoned out of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;We would want to see a situation like that in the United Kingdom, where there is an act which forbids works of art from leaving the country before they are shown to the institution charged with preservation of the finest examples of their culture and heritage,&quot; says the executive director of the National Gallery, historian Prof. George Kahari.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is part of the work of the National Gallery to delve into the past, collect and preserve the finest examples of Zimbabwe's cultural heritage, enabling the institution to display the artistic and cultural soul of the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Prof. Kahari said in an interview recently that the National Gallery was also concerned about what artists were being paid for their work. &quot;The prices are low, but a contract between the buyer and seller (artist) at the moment prevents us from intervening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The gallery, he adds, was &quot;concerned and we are in the midst of formulating some guidelines to protect artists, especially those in the rural areas...&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a historian, Prof. Kahari's concerns stem from knowledge of how art and sculpture in particular, has helped put Zimbabwe on the world map. There is also cognisance of the important role art plays in recording, embodying and anticipating the national aspirations and the need to be able to mirror these to the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The other cause for concern is driven by realisation of the potential loss to the nation if the situation continues without adoption of the proposals being formulated by the gallery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The issue of the impact of airport art on fine art and the difference between the two is less of a problem, largely because of the existence of structures that distinguishes these, but also there is acceptance that even within airport art as in airport books, there are some gems of artistic brilliance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">New York -- The following is a letter by Human Rights Watch urging the exemption of humanitarian aid and assistance from the economic sanctions imposed against Burundi. The letter was sent on August 28, 1996 to the presidents of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zaire, and Zambia, to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and the secretary general of the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the letter, HRW also calls upon Burundi's new government to bring to trial those who have presided over the last three years of bloodshed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch is a nongovernmental organization established in 1978 to monitor and promote the observance of internationally recognized human rights in Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle East and among the signatories of the Helsinki accords. It is supported by contributions from private individuals and foundations worldwide. It accepts no government funds, directly or indirectly.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The text of the letter:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">On July 31,1996, in response to the coup d'etat that led to the installation of Major Pierre Buyoya as head of state, members of the Arusha &quot; Emergency African Summit&quot; imposed full economic sanctions upon Burundi including the cutting off of air links. Between August 2 and 10, 1996 all its neighbors implemented an economic embargo against Burundi. On August 16, 1996, regional foreign ministers decreed that only medicines and &quot;emergency basic food aid for Rwandan refugees in Burundi&quot; would be exempt from sanctions imposed at Arusha.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although Human Rights Watch has serious concerns about the nature of the embargo imposed on Burundi, as outlined below, we share the sentiments that led Burundi's neighbors to act firmly in opposition to the coup. While we welcome the new government's pledge to stop the killing, we cannot help but note that the same military officers who launched the coup have been responsible for the terrible bloodshed at the hands of the Burundi army and allied militia for the past three years. A vow, in such circumstances, to stop the killing is hardly justification for abandoning the last elements of power sharing with the Hutu majority that remain from the June 1993 elections.  Rather, a test of the new government's commitment to democracy and rule of law should not only be its willingness to begin immediate discussions about a return to constitutional rule, as neighboring countries are demanding, but also its willingness to bring to justice those who have presided over the last three years of slaughter. Among those who certainly should be brought to justice are the former army chief of staff, Col. Jean Bikomagu, and the head of the gendarmerie, Col. Pascal Simbanduka: they are both, according to Human Rights Watch's own investigations, responsible for serious, violent abuses of human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Human Rights Watch is also profoundly troubled by the scope of the sanctions regime imposed on Burundi. We have received reports that the sanctions are severely constraining the efforts of humanitarian organizations to deliver assistance to the civilian population of Burundi.  Little, if any humanitarian aid appears to be reaching an increasingly needy population.  International humanitarian law prohibits the employment of starvation as a method of warfare. Parties to a conflict are enjoined from acts which might hinder the availability of commodities and services that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. By the same token, economic sanctions should not be applied in a manner that substantially risks denying Burundi's civilian population foodstuffs, medicines and other humanitarian supplies that are vital to its subsistence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Humanitarian assistance should be entirely excluded from the sanctions regime imposed upon Burundi in order to enable non-governmental organizations to dispense aid to all sectors of Burundi's vulnerable civilian population.  We therefore urge that at its inaugural meeting in Nairobi on August 31, the Regional Sanctions Committee should formally and unambiguously exempt all humanitarian cargo and personnel from the sanctions regime imposed upon Burundi at the July 31, 1996 Arusha summit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In addition to an exemption for humanitarian assistance, steps should be taken to ensure that the aid is distributed among the civilian population on the basis of need alone rather than on grounds of ethnicity or political affiliation. Further, steps should be taken to ensure that humanitarian aid not go to any military force, and that military forces inside Burundi do not obstruct the delivery of this aid to its intended recipients. Humanitarian aid should be distributed by nongovernmental organizations, a United Nations agency, or a combination of these and coordinated by a mutually agreed upon UN or NGO body. There should also be established an effective mechanism for monitoring the impacts of the current embargo, even with these necessary humanitarian exemptions. Given the growing need for humanitarian assistance on the part of Burundi's civilian population, Human Rights Watch believes that the quest for guarantees against misuse of humanitarian aid should not be permitted to delay unduly the actual delivery of humanitarian supplies.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">HARARE, Zimbabwe - The strike by civil servants in Zimbabwe has exposed divisions within the ruling ZANU PF (Zimbabwean African National Patriotic Front Party), the top leadership in government and civil servants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It has also shown that while the ruling party has for the past five years liberalized the economy, a part of its leadership has not been able to liberalize its own mindset and still believes in media manipulation to achieve political goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">These contradictions created a situation during the current strike by the civil servants in which the strikers won public sympathy and covert support from the police and the armed forces, who anticipated higher salaries should the government meet the demands of the strikers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">During the strike, the government, notably the minister of the public service, labor and social welfare, Florence Chitauro, made decisions which to many, including the strikers, were obviously unsustainable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those on strike saw the hollowness of the threat to fire 90 percent of the civil service, including doctors, nurses, airport fire-fighters and technicians. How can the country be ran normally?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Let them fire all of us and let's see how they hope to run the country. In fact we can grind the country to a halt if they continue along those lines,&quot; boasted Givemore Masongorere, president of the Public Services Association (PSA), when Chitauro announced the mass dismissal of civil servants on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Analysts sympathetic to the government have concluded that the cabinet decision to fire and shut all lines of communication with the strikers was based on wrong information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The situation was compounded by a news black-out on the strike in the dominant state media. The origin and legality of that order remains unclear.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The acting director-general of the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC), Victor Mhizha-Murira, acknowledging the black-out, saying it was a local decision by departmental heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The result, however, was that decision-makers found themselves in the dark as to the thinking of the strikers. On the other hand, the civil servants had scant regard to government statements coming out in the state media and ridiculed the newspapers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An honest analysis based on accurate information might have predicted a lengthy industrial action given that the civil servants grievances were genuine and deep-seated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The support rendered by the teachers, nurses and doctors who have had experience in such strikes could also have been seen as a factor that would bolster the resolve of the strikers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The support the strikers received from members of parliament, some of them senior members of the ruling party, though initially suppressed from publication, also demonstrated the complexity of the civil servants strike and the level of support they had.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">That the cabinet, and later the president, were acting on wrong information, came to light when Chitauro acknowledged what everybody else had known all along that the Public Service Commission had erred in awarding the majority of civil servants less than 10 percent salary increases when the original government commitment was at least 20 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This was starkly illustrated when President Robert Mugabe, returning from South Africa, told journalists that he was not aware of the civil servants grievances and that as far as he knew, they had been awarded a 20 percent salary hike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a result, the apparent misrepresentation to cabinet and the president took center-stage for a long time resulting in the strike perhaps running longer than was necessary at the expense of the economy and the ordinary people who saw many of their relatives die in hospitals due to lack of care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When the truth came out - that the civil servants had not been given what they had been promised and therefore had a genuine grievance - Chitauro found herself on quicksand, politically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">This, coming out at a time the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) had threatened a nationwide strike in support of the civil servants, could have made the task even more difficult for Chitauro to explain to her colleagues in cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">An impression was created that the blunder was simply an oversight on the part of the government. It was a small issue that could be rectified (ratified, as Chitauro put it) and needed no negotiation with the civil servants but simply implementation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">What about the order dismissing all civil servants who had refused to go back to work before the new deal was struck?, asked members of the unified civil servants negotiating committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">They stood to negotiate themselves out of work if that order was not rescinded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Moreover, there was also the question of whether there would be any other victimization of the strikers, such as the withholding of pay for the time they have been on strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Chitauro, in a response which she repeated in writing on Friday, said that the order could only be rescinded by cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But her situation became invidious in that the same cabinet and president had acted on wrong information emanating from her office and the public service commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of her colleagues in cabinet, reportedly divided over the issue because of the misleading information, may want to know how that misinformation came about, whether it was deliberate, who was responsible and what agenda they were pushing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There are political costs to be borne given that elections for the mayor for Harare are due early September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The independent candidate, Kempton Makamure, challenging ZANU PF's Solomon Tawengwa, is putting up a spirited campaign while Tawengwa's campaign seems to be flagging despite being backed by the most powerful political machine in the land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Harare's satellite town of Chitungwiza, elections are also on for the mayor and the ruling party's candidate, Andrew Jiri, is facing a stiff challenge from the party's rebel, who chose to stand as an independent, George Mhashu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In such a scenario, blunders by the PSC and Chitauro which tend to chip away at the party's popularity base, would inevitably be irksome to the party's old guard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A former trade unionist who was co-opted into ZANU PF in 1990, when the party needed a representative from the ZCTU, Chitauro, despite her grave responsibilities in matters of state, is a lightweight in ZANU PF when the liberationists ponder their tenure of power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While publicly Chitauro and her colleagues in cabinet will have to wriggle their way out of the current impasse, with a decision next Tuesday on whether the dismissed civil would be allowed back at work, somebody might have to bear the consequences of putting the party and government in such an invidious position.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia - Ethiopian health authorities said here they have sent sufficient drugs, equipment and medical staff for victims of flooded areas in the eastern part of the country to control possible outbreak of malaria and water-borne diseases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The country's health minister, Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim, said on television Thursday night a task force of health staff had been dispatched earlier this week to localities along the flooded middle and lower Awash river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Following heavy flooding the previous week that completely inundated the sugar estate and factory town of Wonji, 125 km (78 miles) east of Addis Ababa, the government had to evacuate all of the town's 25,000 residents to higher grounds in the nearby town of Nazareth by the weekend.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The minister said those who were evacuated have been getting sufficient medical attention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said a medical team with medicine and equipment had also been sent to the hamlet of Fogera on the northern shore of Lake Tana in north-western Ethiopia, which was partially flooded early this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian television also reported that construction and reinforcement of protective bunkers was underway on the banks of Awash river to protect Dubti town from imminent floods.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It said a total of 20 km (12.5 miles) of dykes had been built, with the heights of the bunkers raised to 1.5 meters (5 feet), to protect Dubti, which is located in the lower Awash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Flood water from the Awash has also invaded the hot-spring resort center at Sodere, 135 km ( 85 miles) east of the Ethiopian capital. The swollen Awash river has continued to wreck havoc on small towns, farm communities and large sugar and cotton plantations in the area since last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The one-square-kilometer (04.4 square mile) Sodere resort complex was flooded early Wednesday when its hot bath and swimming facilities were completely submerged by muddy waters from the Awash river.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">According to press reports, close to 3,000 workers at the Sodere hotel and others from nearby banana, papaya and mango plantations have been evacuated to the town of Nazareth, 20 km (12.5 miles) west of Sodere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ethiopian authorities last night issued fresh warnings to the inhabitants along the middle and lower Awash river not be lulled by the stoppage of the rains during the last two days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sodere's flooding was caused by a discharge of waters Tuesday from the Koka dam, 35 km (22 miles) west of the sugar estate and factory town of Wonji that was totally flooded over the weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Koka dam was said to have been filled to the brim. Its floodgates were opened Tuesday as the water level of the dam passed the peak mark of 110 meters (363 feet) and started spilling over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The only reported casualty so far has been an unidentified dead man whose body was found floating along the flooded Wonji-Nazareth road over the weekend.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BUJUMBURA, Burundi - A director from the Geneva-based United nations Human Rights center, Diabira Marufa, said Friday in Bujumbura that at least 175 international observers would be needed to monitor human rights in the 115 communes of Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Reacting to Thursday's request by the military regime in Bujumbura on the human rights commission to send observers to the civil-war torn country, he said up to 200 of such observers were necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marufa, who is Mauritanian, told PANA in Bujumbura the issue of sending observers to Bujumbura had been discussed with the previous administration of President Sylivestre Ntibantunganya, who was replaced by Maj. Pierre Buyoya in a Coup d'Etat on July 25.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A fund-raising campaign has been under way for the past one month among United Nations member countries,&quot; he said, without specifying the cost or duration of the proposed human rights observer mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He said, however, that some 950,000 US dollars was required to maintain 35 observers in Burundi for a month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Since April, the European Union has been financing the activities of four human rights observers in Burundi. Last month, these observers wrote a critical report which angered the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The report talked of &quot;massive human rights violations&quot; perpetrated against members of the Hutu majority ethnic group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Marufa said the four observers had investigated &quot;a certain number of major incidents&quot; but were unable to travel to all parts of the country, particularly in the troubled north-eastern Burundi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In its letter, the Burundi government asked the UN Human Rights High Commissioner to &quot;substantially raise&quot; the number of observers so as to &quot; reinforce the government's efforts to end human rights violations in Burundi.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bujumbura wrote the letter in the wake of a report by the London-based Amnesty International, which accused the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army of slaying up to 6,000 civilians between late July and early August.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The military regime in Bujumbura rejected the charge saying it was unrealistic.</SPAN></P>
