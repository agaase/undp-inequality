</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the top levels, the Clinton foreign policy team probably has more experience with Africa than that of any previous administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anthony Lake, the president's national security adviser, has researched and written about African issues and was deeply involved in formulating Africa policy for the Carter administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Southern Africa was one of his primary areas of interests,&quot; says Marianne Spiegel, who was the Africa specialist on the State Department's Policy Planning Staff that Lake headed throughout the Carter years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake wrote his Ph.D. dissertation at Princeton on South Africa and also authored The Tar-Baby Option, a study of Africa policy in the Nixon presidency. As a young foreign service officer, Lake served on the staff of Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, but resigned to protest the 1970 bombing of Cambodia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before joining the Carter administration, Lake headed International Voluntary Services, which sent Americans to assist grass-roots development efforts abroad. In recent years, he has taught international relations at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secretary of State Warren Christopher also shaped Carter's policy as deputy secretary of state. Although less intensely involved in African issues than Lake, Christopher, in his role as chief negotiator for the release of American hostages in Iran, developed a close association with Algeria, a key intermediary in the negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Christopher's chief Africa aide will be the assistant secretary for Africa, George Moose, who was a junior member of the Carter Africa team, first as a desk officer and later as deputy director for southern Africa during the negotiations to end white rule in Rhodesia. In the early years of the Reagan administration, Moose served under Ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the United States Mission to the United Nations in New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was named U.S. ambassador to the West African nation of Benin in 1983 and, in 1986, ambassador to Senegal. Like the current assistant secretary, Herman Cohen, who is also a former ambassador to Senegal, Moose is fluent in French.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Pentagon, a key post with significance for Africa policy is slated to go to Frank Wisner, who most recently has been undersecretary of State for security affairs, with major responsibility for coordinating the Bush administration's Somalia policy. Wisner's official involvement with Africa dates to 1976, when he was chosen to direct southern African affairs just as then-Secretary of State Kissinger embarked on a round of shuttle diplomacy in southern Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wisner was a player in various facets of Carter Africa policy, serving as ambassador to Zambia for part of the period. He then helped coordinate the Reagan administration's negotiations with Angola, Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa, before leaving Washington to become U.S. ambassador to Egypt during the late 1980s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wisner now moves to undersecretary for policy, under Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, for the Pentagon. One of the six or seven assistant secretaries serving Wisner is likely to be Jock Covey, a former Wisner aide at State, who is to head the newly renamed Bureau of Regional Affairs. The post of deputy secretary for Africa in that bureau is currently James Woods, an experienced Africa hand who has held the job since the Carter years.  Slated for another assistant secretary post is Morton Halperin, until recently head of the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union, who will head up a Defense Department bureau dealing with democracy and human rights issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawrence Summers, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's choice as undersecretary for international affairs, is a former professor of political economy at Harvard, who has dealt extensively with Africa as chief economist at the World Bank. Summers' appointment may be the most controversial of those that will deal significantly with Africa. His nomination, and earlier indications that he was being considered to head the Council of Economic Advisors, were criticized by environmental and other non-governmental groups.  A statement issued by the Development Gap for Alternative Policies in Washington charges that Summers &quot;aggressively promoted&quot; World Bank policies &quot;that have caused social, economic and environmental devastation across the southern hemisphere.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of key lower level posts are still unfilled. In the Africa Bureau at the State Department, three deputy assistant secretaries who are career officials remain in their posts. Decisions about those posts await Senate confirmation of George Moose, who is expected to name his own aides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Principal deputy in the interim is Jeffrey Davidow, a former U.S.  ambassador to Zambia, who is responsible for southern Africa. He will complete a three-year appointment to that post in March or April. Robert Houdek, who is in charge of east Africa and Zaire, and John Byerley, a lawyer recently named to handle economic matters, may or may not be retained by Moose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the National Security Council (NSC), Lake has chosen Jennifer Ward, the U.S. ambassador in Niger, to handle African affairs. Ward, who will complete her current tour in May, is a career foreign service officer who served a brief tenure in the 1970s as staff director of the House Africa subcommittee and as a Pentagon consultant. Her title is slated to be senior director for Africa, which is an elevation of the classification the position had in the Bush administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ernest Wilson, a specialist on African economic issues, is coordinating global economic policy matters for the NSC. Wilson, who left a teaching post at the University of Michigan last fall to become a Council on Foreign Relations fellow and teach at the University of Maryland, will handle such issues as foreign aid reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Capitol Hill, the House Africa subcommittee has a new chairman and the Senate Africa subcommittee a new ranking Republican. Paul Simon of Illinois continues to chair the Senate panel, but the ranking minority member is now James R. Jeffords of Vermont.  He replaces Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, who retains membership on the Foreign Affairs Committee but relinquished her subcommittee spot in order to become the ranking minority member of the Labor Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harry Johnston from Florida succeeds Mervyn Dymally, who retired at the end of the last Congress, as head of the Africa subcommittee in the House. Democratic members also include Donald Payne and Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, Alcee Hastings from Florida and Don Edwards from California, along with Republicans Dan Burton (IN), Lincoln Diaz- Balart (FL) and Edward Royce (CA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The subcommittee itself was almost eliminated in a restructuring design proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee Hamilton. The move would have combined the Africa and Inter-American Affairs subcommittees, but the plan was abandoned after strong opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus and Africa interest groups, including Africare, TransAfrica and the Washington Office on Africa.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The killing and destruction in Zaire is further evidence of the total breakdown of government in that central African nation, presided over by a man who has been one of Washington's closest allies in Africa. President Mobutu Sese Seko appears, once again, to have hammered the process of democratization to a standstill in his starving and bleeding country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fact that most of the dead were soldiers, in three days of violence that began January 28, points up the cynicism of Mobutu's misrule.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Troops of the regular army are given little or no ammunition and are paid poorly, if at all. They have become thugs to survive, but they are as hungry and as alienated from the president as the people they beat and loot in Kinshasa's sprawling slums. No one who knew Zaire was surprised that the army rioted after being paid with the new banknotes that Mobutu had printed and which most shopkeepers refuse to accept.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast, Mobutu's Special Presidential Detachment is a well- armed elite, using tanks and trucks to raid the homes of wealthy foreigners or members of the opposition and haul away the booty. Mobutu's method of restoring order after the riots was to send the special detachment on a killing orgy against members of the army and their families, leaving hundreds of dead and wounded in a city lacking both medical care and food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Mobutu stays in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Backed by the detachment, he blocks every move of the transition government that was chosen by a pro-democracy coalition. Robbed of the power of the purse, Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi is stymied. Meetings of the High Council of the Republic, the democratic parliament headed by Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Pasinya Monsengwo, have been barred by Mobutu.  Gatherings of more than five people have been banned. The press is muzzled.  In the resulting power vacuum, Mobutu skillfully exploits the rivalries and tensions among opposition forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither Tshisekedi nor any other opposition leader can function as head of a transitional government as long as the president controls the special detachment and the central bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Provoking the army to violence appears to have been an intentional maneuver by the president. It has frightened away Europeans who could have been witnesses to further crackdowns against the democracy process. It has provided an excuse for Mobutu to move against the transition government, which he blames for promoting instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the mounting evidence of corruption, incompetence and repression in Zaire, the Bush administration failed to oppose Mobutu openly and vigorously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Clinton has said that his administration will not coddle dictators. To make that commitment meaningful in Zaire, he should reverse the policy that has allowed Mobutu to pillage his own country and people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton administration should signal, in the strongest possible terms, that leniency toward Mobutu is at an end. In the name of U.S.  taxpayers, whose money has funded Mobutu's lavish lifestyle and swollen his foreign bank accounts, the American government should work to freeze Mobutu's financial assets, as well as those of his cronies, and encourage European countries to do the same. Washington should also support imposition of a fuel embargo to pressure the president to yield to the demands of his people. *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of Africa's grandest beasts will disappear unless saving the rhino can be made more profitable than killing it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by Nick O'Connor</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1961, the British naturalist Sir Peter Scott warned that the black rhinoceros, a species found only in Africa, would be extinct within 30 years.  He was too pessimistic, but not by much.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, there are fewer than 2,000 of the animals left, scattered in a handful of African countries. (There are thought to be about 5,000 African white rhino, mainly in South Africa, and fewer than 3,000 of other species in Asia.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am a tobacco farmer, a third-generation Zimbabwean, but like many farmers here, I am in the front line of the fight to save our rhinos. Sadly, it is a fight that we are losing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1989 rhino census recorded about 2,000 in the country, with 130 in commercial conservancies and the rest in our national parks. Zimbabwe was home to 50% of all the remaining rhino in Africa. Perhaps this news alerted the poachers, because reports of shootings started coming in from all over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three years later, the most recent census shows that we are left with a maximum of 450 rhinos, and probably no more than 300. In other words, on average, more than one rhino has been shot every day. Births in the conservancies increased numbers there to 149 in 1992, despite 15 having been poached.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For years, conservationists have warned of poachers crossing our borders, prompting our government to initiate a &quot;shoot-to-kill&quot; policy against poachers from neighboring Zambia. We have even used trackers disguised as peasant fishermen along the Zambezi river boundary between the two countries, resulting in lethal games of cat-and-mouse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the Zambians continue to poach, it is now obvious that most of the current poaching is by fellow Zimbabweans, and this really hurts.  Realizing that the Zambians could not be stopped, local poachers apparently decided to get in on the action. Starting in the national parks, using inside information, they have quietly and systematically killed our rhino.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past two months, the poachers have changed tactics. With rhino so scarce in the national parks, there has been a full-scale attack on the conservancies. These refuges, varying in size from 100,000 to 500,000 acres, were formed by groups of commercial farmers who joined large tracts of land to create mini-parks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are five such parks in Zimbabwe. We were determined to pool our resources and provide the security needed to end the killing. Until late last year we were succeeding, but fate has been unkind. The 1992 drought that devastated Zimbabwe's agriculture has financially crippled many of the farmers involved in the conservancies and it coincided with an increase in the poachers' attacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month one conservancy lost all 12 of its black rhino. We called a &quot;council of war,&quot; and two weeks ago we just managed to stop four poachers, armed with AK47s and driving a high-speed vehicle, from entering the Midlands Black Rhino Conservancy of which I am a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now we too have had our first loss. We can only do our best, and we are in desperate need of help. But whatever we do will not remove my sense of guilt for failing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What a world we live in, where a few individuals in the African bush must shoulder the responsibility of protecting a species for all our children and are forced to make constant appeals to the developed nations for money.  This cannot be the long-term solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis of the rhino is fueled by the demand for its horn from nations of the Far East. The resulting scarcity of animals drives prices higher, prompting more killings. Extinction is the inevitable result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because supply and demand will always prevail in a capitalist world, there seems no point in appealing for decency from the Yemenis, Japanese or Chinese, who erroneously believe that a pinch of horn will cure them of anything.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifteen years ago, the International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) made all trade in horn illegal. We have been losing the battle ever since. The black rhino population of Africa has fallen from 65,000 to fewer than 2,000 in the same period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my opinion, the answer to the rhino's survival lies in private ownership. Currently, because the rhino is an endangered species, it is protected by the state. Individuals are not allowed to sell rhinos, and yet there is a massive potential market for them. In theory, profits from rhino sales could be used to pay for all the necessary conservation work and would encourage every farmer in Africa to set up breeding programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As things now stand, even if poaching could be eliminated, the encroachment of people would still threaten not only the rhino, but all Africa's wildlife. In the constant struggle for scarce resources, with ever- increasing human populations, wildlife will always lose out unless it can be used to make money. This has happened in every single industrial nation, and it is naive to assume that Third World countries will follow a different path to development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rhino is a dangerous beast, as welcome to most African farmers as wolves were in Scotland or bears in the New Forest of England, before hunting eradicated them. Until rural people see wild animals as a vital source of revenue as important to their financial well being as farming or cattle the rhino, the elephant and many other species are doomed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We in the conservancies will fight on, but we need help. Zimbabwe's rhino may only have 18 months left. After that, all arguments will be academic.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than a year of military tension and political power struggles exploded in Zaire's capital at the end of January, when soldiers went on a looting and killing rampage after being paid with worthless currency printed by the besieged regime of President Mobutu Sese Seko. Pro- democracy officials say at least 1,000 people were killed and scores of others injured when troops in Zaire's regular army began rioting on the streets of Kinshasa, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the dead were soldiers killed by Mobutu Sese Seko's elite presidential guard unit. &quot;There were lots of soldiers missing at role call&quot; after the clashes, says Jean Joseph Mukendi, a close aide to Prime Minister Etianne Tshisekedi who was chosen by the pro-democracy coalition to head a transition government. The current conflict recalls similar violence 16 months ago when unpaid soldiers went on a looting spree across the country, leaving more than 100 dead and forcing the evacuation of some 20,000 foreigners.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transportation is almost at a halt. The military has sealed off the Gombe area of Kinshasa, where most of the foreigners who have chosen to stay in Zaire reside. Soldiers also have been shooting outside the Intercontinental Hotel, an oasis of privilege in the impoverished and looted capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition leaders accuse Mobutu of instigating the revolt to give the appearance that he is the only person who can keep Zaire under control. The president's critics say the frustration of the soldiers was predictable, because both shopkeepers and the democracy movement had publicized their refusal to accept Mobutu's new bank notes. &quot;It's just cinema,&quot; says Buana Kabue, leader of Zaire's Human Rights League. &quot;If the international community doesn't intervene, the dictatorship is going to enforce itself and continue to kill to stay in power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three years ago, Mobutu promised to cede power to a growing democracy movement. A national democracy conference last summer chose Tshisekedi to head the transition government, but Mobutu hired and fired him within a span of two weeks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About 600 Belgian troops have been standing by in Brazzaville across the Congo River from Zaire's capital, but Brussels said that all but 120 of those forces would be withdrawn. The troops were flown in to help evacuate more than 1,000 Belgian, French and other foreign nationals from Kinshasa.  Expatriates say they feel more threatened by the latest violence than by previous clashes because the soldiers appear to be targeting foreigners. At least seven have been killed in the melee, including France's ambassador to Zaire, Philipe Brenard, who died in a machine-gun attack on the French embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Tshisekedi appealed for foreign assistance to halt the killings, but Mobutu vowed to bar the Belgians from intervening in their former colony. Then, in a conciliatory move, the president made his personal riverboat available to help evacuate Belgians and other foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Mobutu seized power in Zaire in 1965 with CIA backing, his attitude toward his foreign allies has been ambivalent. In the 1970s, he began an &quot;authenticity&quot; campaign to shake off colonial cultural residues. He prohibited the wearing of ties, ruled that Zairean names must replace &quot;Christian&quot; names, and changed the name of the country and adjacent river from the Congo to Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu retains power now by keeping a tight grip on the nation's purse strings, maintaining the loyalty of his armed presidential guards through gifts and money. But regular army units are out of control, and the chain of command has crumbled, leaving Zaire in a complete state of lawlessness. The country has become a sweltering haven for mercenaries, counterfeiters and diamond smugglers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu rules the central bank. Bank-note paper often is flown to Zaire from Germany, where it is printed, and then rushed to Mobutu's boat. He spends most of his time on the river, apparently to avoid the wrath of the hungry and desperate citizenry in the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire's latest military and political crisis revolves around currency worth about two U.S. dollars. When Mobutu ordered distribution of the new 5-million-zaire notes, his arch rival, Prime Minister Tshisekedi declared the bills nonlegal tender. Merchants and street vendors refused to accept them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although payday for Zaire's army falls at the end of the month, soldiers often wait months to receive even part of their wages. Mobutu's decision to meet the army payroll with 5-million-zaire notes prompted immediate revolt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A U.S. dollar that bought 50,000 zaires a year ago now buys almost 3 million, reflecting Zaire's economic collapse. Mobutu says a new bill of 10 million zaires will be put into circulation soon. But the conflict over currency is a symbol of the country's ongoing power struggle. Last week, Mobutu implicitly accused Tshisekedi of high treason for rejecting the new currency. At the same time, the president announced that &quot;democracy remains on course.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Waat, Sudan</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What strikes you when you come to Waat is the smell of death and the vultures watching for corpses, says Lisa, an American aid worker at one of the few spots in southern Sudan where international relief agencies are allowed to operate. Tonight the buzzards won't hover in vain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> N'deng's five-year-old body, shriveled and covered with flies, will be left to rot outside the camp. N'deng can't be buried because dying of starvation is ignominious, explains his emaciated father, who has just arrived here with his family after a three-week walk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plight of this town highlights the tragedy of the entire civilian population of southern Sudan, which is trapped in a web of wars. Fighting has raged since 1983, when long-simmering animosities erupted into open warfare between an authoritarian Islamic government in the north and rebels fighting for autonomy of the Christian and animist south. The spark that reignited the three-decade conflict was the government's attempt to impose Sharia, a strict Islamic code, throughout the country. But racial factors are also behind the years of suspicion and periodic warfare, with black southerners charging that the policies of their Arab rulers are racist and discriminatory.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International power politics have further fueled the civil war. The government is supported by Islamic Iran and Libya, while rebels find refuge in Kenya and Uganda, across Sudan's southern borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> N'deng's family is among the thousands who had to flee their homes when government forces swept through southern Sudan early this year in a new offensive against the rebels. Roaming the desert, the family followed the sounds of United Nations relief planes, vaguely hoping to find food, peace and shelter before eventually wandering into Waat, a rebel- controlled village in the Upper Nile region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until last summer, Waat's 3,000 semi-nomadic inhabitants managed to survive on their meager livestock and an unreliable well pump. In late August, with war-induced famine sweeping the region, the Khartoum authorities allowed the United Nations to fly emergency aid from Kenya to the airstrip here. Since then, the town has become an open camp, swollen by more than 15,000 civilians who have converged on it from all parts of southern Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Life in Waat is punctuated by a succession of sounds, some homely, some ominous. Morning begins with the cock's crow. During the day, the murmur of voices is broken by occasional bursts of distant gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People also listen warily for the characteristic burr of bombers. Each time one approaches, the crowd falls silent until after the noise overhead has died down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At nightfall there are cries of children playing in puddles and the chanting of adults. As the night wears on, only the thud of tom-toms remains.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rumble of an incoming relief plane is probably the most welcome sound of all. Whenever it is heard, all activity stops and hundreds flock toward the runway where the white Buffalo aircraft will deliver the food on which the lives of everyone here depend. Nothing grows in Waat, and the grazing is too scant to support enough livestock for 20,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Slender Thread. The vital air link, however, is tenuous. Permission to land must be obtained from Khartoum each month. Even if permission is granted, the overused aircraft can break down at any moment. Four months ago, scores of people died when the plane was grounded for 10 days of repairs.  Many more starved to death over the next three weeks, when relief operations were suspended temporarily after five aid workers in southern Sudan were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a French doctor on a fact-finding mission in Waat, this is a place of survivors and of immense will power. Only those who were strong enough to walk for weeks have made it here. Typical of those is a 45-year-old grandmother in charge of six children. Their father had been killed in combat and their mother had died on the way to the camp. Bad as the situation is, Waat is a humanitarian oasis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even in this oasis, two-thirds of the children face starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The crisis is made worse by a severe shortage of drinkable water. Even if the balky well pump became fully operational, it could not produce nearly enough water. Latrines are few and far between. Diseased cattle and dogs roam freely about the camp.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People are forced to drink and wash from polluted puddles. The food is also contaminated, because the &quot;dry aid'' supplied by the United Nations must be mixed with water.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Can't Cope. The three UN aid workers now based in Waat are completely unequipped to deal with a crisis of this magnitude. Exhausted and grieving, they can only express their frustration by sending report after report. But they feel that nobody is listening.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The people out there don't have a clue about what's happening here,'' says one. &quot;We see the vultures, we watch people die. What are they doing?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lisa was the only UN staff member in Waat when there were no flights for 10 days. &quot;I had to tell the mother of a dying child that the plane had broken down,'' she says. &quot;Sometimes when I send my reports by radio I burst into tears.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as the southern Sudanese were successfully resisting the government's offensive, the SPLA remained united. But since the beginning of 1992, when one rebel-held town after another fell into the hands of government forces, the latent tension within the southern camps has degenerated into open conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that Khartoum controls about 90% of southern Sudan, the rebels have split mainly along ethnic lines. Longtime SPLA leader John Garang still resists in the southwest with the backing of the Dinka people. A breakaway group called the Nasir faction, which charges Garang with undemocratic practices, holds out in the east where the Nuer people predominate. Elders belonging to other ethnic groups play a complex game of shifting alliances.  The region's people, as always, are caught in the middle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the famine, like the war, has thrown the groups together again.  Although Waat is in a Nuer area, many of those who have traveled the farthest across the desert to get here, and whose children show the red tinted hair characteristic of malnutrition, are from Dinka areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as the fighting continues, the plight of the southern Sudanese is sure to worsen. Crops sown during the wet season are plundered by armies at the start of the dry season. Cattle that have not been decimated by hunger and disease are often stolen. Millions of people wander the countryside, at the mercy of emergency aid and those who control it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tip of the Iceberg. In the immediate future, the best hope for many of the region's starving people would appear to be the already crowded refugee camps in neighboring Uganda and Kenya, where they could become internationally recognized refugees and not mere &quot;displaced persons&quot; inside Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But United Nations officials and field workers have become hamstrung by political factors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three years ago, the world body launched Operation Lifeline Sudan to deliver relief to the starving south, exerting strong pressure on a weak Sudanese government to secure its cooperation. But since Islamic hard- liners seized power in Khartoum in 1989, Lifeline has become a shadow of itself.  Every month Khartoum rejects some of the relief flights attempted by the United Nations. Much of the aid doesn't reach Sudan, let alone get distributed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government in Khartoum claims there is no famine. Official success in limiting the entry and movements of foreigners, including journalists, is one reason the plight of Sudan's people is so little known.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So when visiting Waat, it is easy to be haunted by a niggling question. Why has the government now allowed a foreign reporter into a place where aid workers can't cope and where only soldiers look well-fed? Could it be that Waat is the most presentable spot in southern Sudan?  * INSIGHT/Guardian News Service</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when South Africa is desperately trying to break out of a four-year recession, the all-important gold price has hit a seven-year low, sending shock waves through the economy and throwing thousands of blacks out of work. There is concern that the continuing recession may blunt the prospects for a smooth transition to democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's 33 mines still produce over 600 tons of the glittering metal each year, making the country the world's largest gold producer. But South Africa also has the deepest and some of the most expensive mines on earth, and they require a gold price of about $400 per ounce in order to be profitable.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gold recently dipped to $326.50 per ounce its lowest level since the mid-1980s. Analysts say there is little hope of improvement in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As long as world inflation is low, gold is really not going to perform well,&quot; says Mike Daly, a South African economist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent global crises such as the Gulf War have shown that investors no longer turn to gold in times of trouble. But gold still brings in more than $5 billion annually for South Africa more than a quarter of the country's export earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worsening state of South Africa's gold mines spells trouble for the entire region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty percent of mineworkers come from South Africa's neighbors, who depend heavily on miners' remittances. In Lesotho, for example, 45% of the gross domestic product comes from this remitted pay, according to Francois Viruly, senior economist for the South African Chamber of Mines, the umbrella group for the country's six major mining houses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's gold mines currently employ over 380,000 miners, but 150,000 jobs have been lost since 1987, and more cutbacks are in the works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the country's largest union, has won hard-fought victories in recent years for miners who spend their working days a mile or more underground in a humid inferno, drilling and blasting holes in a wall of gray rock to expose a thin seam of ore. Several hundred workers are killed every year, but lack of jobs in the region is so severe that there is never a shortage of replacements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The painful irony of South Africa's gold industry is that it was built on cheap labor. Now labor accounts for 50% of total costs, and South Africa's old mines have moved from being the lowest-cost producers in the world to being among the highest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the crisis, NUM accepted a wage increase of only six percent (inflation is 12%) in order to avoid layoffs. The union, which has about 300,000 members, also has asked the government to subsidize marginal mines where over 80,000 people remain employed, but the government has not agreed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The answer we got was to let the free market take care of it,&quot; says Jerry Majatlagi, a spokesman for NUM.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, the market has not been helping South Africa's gold mining industry for the past decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The gold price has fallen steadily since early 1980 when it reached an all-time high of $875 per ounce. The recent tumble results primarily from the strength of the U.S. dollar, many analysts believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasing supplies of gold on the world market have also pushed down the price. Since the Gulf War, some analysts suspect that Iraq has sold off large amounts of its gold to meet foreign exchange needs. The failed economy of the former Soviet Union sparked sales of gold by Russia to finance the move to a free-market economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If we're going to grow in the years to come we're going to need foreign exchange to get the economy moving,&quot; Viruly warns. &quot;The mining industry will have to play an important role so we have the foreign exchange to grow.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The low gold price should be a warning that South Africa must restructure and diversify its economy, strengthening particularly its manufacturing sector, economists say. South Africa needs to produce more value-added goods that can take over from gold as major foreign exchange earners. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With the new Africa policy team not yet complete, Clinton administration officials are scrambling to react to a resumption of Angola's bloody civil war and to fighting in Zaire. The Angolan strife pits a formerly U.S.-backed rebel group against a government that won a United Nations-monitored election last year. In Zaire, where an estimated 1,000 people died in rioting late last month, a democracy movement is trying to oust a ruler who is one of Washington's oldest allies in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Angola and Zaire have posed prickly issues for previous presidents, and several of President Clinton's foreign policy experts grappled with the problems while serving in the Carter administration. The latest difficulties have prompted the State Department to dispatch a five- person delegation to the first round of United Nations-sponsored peace talks on Angola that began late last month and to send a senior official to Brussels for consultations on Zaire with the Belgian and French governments in early February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bipartisan group from both houses of Congress has appealed to Secretary of State Warren Christopher for an aggressive U.S. peacemaking role in Angola. &quot;The U.S. can make a positive difference in one of the major crisis areas of the world,&quot; a letter from a number of members says.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The current Angolan conflict has some of the elements of fighting that raged throughout the 1980s, when the Soviet and Cuban-backed government battled to a virtual draw against the rebel group Unita, led by Jonas Savimbi, who had the support of the United States and South Africa. While Washington and Moscow are no longer waging a proxy war in Angola, and South African soldiers have withdrawn from Angolan territory, Angola says South Africa is still active in the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We know that the Pretoria regime is trying to save Savimbi,&quot; Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura said in a telephone interview earlier this month during a visit to New York. De Moura charges that neighboring Zaire also is aiding Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prior to Clinton's inauguration, Africa watchers expected him to respond to last September's Angolan voting by extending diplomatic recognition to the government headed by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.  Although Angola won independence from Portugal in 1975, previous American administrations have refused to establish formal ties with the Marxist-oriented regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Zaire, Clinton was thought likely to distance the American government from President Mobutu Sese Seko, who traded on his long- standing ties with the CIA to make Zaire the third largest recipient of U.S. aid to sub-Saharan Africa over the past three decades.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But worsening violence in both countries has narrowed Clinton's options. Although sentiment favoring recognition of the Angolan government is strong within the administration, some officials are advocating a delay while the United Nations sponsors peace talks. Another argument on the go-slow side is the Angolan government's recent loss of territorial control. Unita now holds an estimated 70% or more of the country, which is about the size of California and Texas combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent combat, Unita rebels beat back an all-out assault on its headquarters at Huambo, Angola's second largest city, although fighting in the area continues. Unita troops also seized the town of Soyo, a key oil- producing center, and they have advanced to the outskirts of the capital, Luanda, where they blew up a pumping station, leaving the city's 2.5 million people facing a spreading cholera outbreak without water. Rebel units also are reported to be active in the enclave of Cabinda, where a U.S.-owned subsidiary pumps most of the country's oil, the government's main revenue earner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State Department has warned Unita not to attack U.S. oil facilities in Cabinda and has deplored indications that both Angolan sides are rearming for further war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fighting that resumed in October has claimed as many as 15,000 lives. More than one million people, a tenth of the population, face imminent starvation, according to the World Food Program. Experts calculate that the damage to Angola's infrastructure, including buildings, roads, bridges and communications facilities, has been greater in recent months than in years of earlier fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN-sponsored elections, the result of a 1991 peace agreement ending 16 years of fighting, were judged generally free and fair by outside observers. But Savimbi's rejection of the official results, which gave him 40.97% of the total to 49.57% for dos Santos, has stalled the electoral process. With the country now returned to a war footing, the runoff required to give one candidate a majority cannot be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace talks are focusing on forging a cease-fire agreement and an interim arrangement to share power until a runoff can be held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congressional letter to Secretary of State Christopher calls for an expanded UN presence in Angola to help ensure the success of any negotiated agreement. The letter's signers advocate recognizing the dos Santos government, on condition that it accept an expanded UN mandate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other members of Congress, including Senate Africa subcommittee chair Paul Simon, are urging Christopher to recognize the Luanda government without delay, arguing that it already has met U.S. conditions by holding internationally supervised elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both members of Congress and administration officials say the United Nations should demobilize the rival armies and create a unified Angolan defense force. Doing so before the September vote might have averted the current troubles, many observers believe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the dos Santos government has been wary of allowing the world body to assume functions that might infringe Angolan sovereignty. In the government's view, it is Unita's refusal to accept the election results, plus interference by South Africa and Zaire, that has revived the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As evidence of what it says is an illegal South African supply operation into Unita territory, the government published a list of four- engine cargo planes and small aircraft with registration numbers, as well as the names of air crew members said to have taken part in the ferry flights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African Foreign Minister Roelof &quot;Pik&quot; Botha has denied the charges, saying in a letter to UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali that his government is not supporting Unita &quot;militarily or in any other way.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda also complains that Zaire has been serving as a rear base for Unita forces and a conduit for the shipment of fuel and other essentials to Savimbi. The CIA used Zaire to supply Unita during the six years of active American support in the Reagan and Bush years, and Mobutu and Savimbi are old confederates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Mobutu has his hands full with troubles at home, after the rioting in late January by army troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've got to think this is the beginning of the end for Mo,&quot; says one government strategist, using the moniker for the Zaire president favored in official Washington. &quot;We've got to face up to what that means for us.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the past year, the Bush administration repeatedly pressed Mobutu to cede powers to a transitional government chosen last August by a national conference of the country's political, religious and professional organizations. But appeals from members of Congress and Mobutu's critics to apply firm pressure on Mobutu to step aside were not heeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every time we got to that point, we were rebuffed by word from on- high at the White House,&quot; says one frustrated government official who is among those who have advocated a more active U.S. diplomatic stance to promote democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Mobutu has been criticized by successive U.S.  administrations, when faced with a crisis he has been able to count on Washington's support. During the late 1970s, the Carter administration twice backed interventions by the French and Belgians to rescue Mobutu from domestic upheaval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. involvement in the recent effort to evacuate foreign nationals from Zaire was minimal. A U.S. Army C-130 cargo plane was sent to carry supplies for the Belgians who sent troops to stand by in neighboring Congo.  But officials with experience in the region know that bigger decisions about Zaire lie just ahead.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the meetings in Brussels with French and Belgian officials, the hold-over assistant secretary of State for Africa, Herman Cohen, is participating in the Clinton administration's deliberations on policy options for handling the crisis. &quot;We knew we would have to deal with Zaire,&quot; says one new appointee. &quot;But now it has moved to the top of the list.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to thank you and your staff sincerely for your informative newspaper, AfricaNews. We have seized the opportunity to reprint your highly enlightening article on American policy toward Africa in the 1990s. We are hoping that our readers will pay keen attention in an effort to further their understanding of some of the thinking about Africa going on in Washington.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you very much for the Special Report on Somalia in the December 21, 1992 - January 3, 1993, issue of AfricaNews. This issue provides the beginning of the kind of in-depth and integrated coverage that I have been frustrated to not find in mainstream newspapers. It is extremely important for the public of the United States (and elsewhere) to see and appreciate the richness and diversity that is being trampled by violence and starvation in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is one aspect of life in Somalia, however, that still needs to be discussed. That is the social, psychological and physical foundation that is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">given to 98 percent of all females in Somalia: the tradition of infibulation, or female genital mutilation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This (practice) will have a profound effect on the recovery of the men, women, children and infrastructure of Somalia. In particular, there are even more obstacles than usual to the birthing of the next generation of Somali babies, who will have to be formed in wombs devastated by hunger and sickness and cross a threshold into the world that has been complicated and diseased by infibulation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I urge you to break the media silence on the lives and concerns of the women and girls who will produce and bring up the next generation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In turn, we'll try you keep you posted -- on the major challenges facing Africa, on how African developments will affect you, and from time to time, on how our other media work is going. At the moment, we have a television crew in Zaire, documenting the struggle between old and new political and economic orders -- important work, we think, in this era when global interdependence is acknowledged in policy discussions, even if not yet taken into account in policy decisions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SAVE THE RHINO</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Wildlife Fund said last week that Africa's black rhinos are at the top of its list of endangered species needing protection, along with the Siberian tiger. The Washington, D-based group said that only the southern African nation of Zimbabwe has a significant number of rhinos, whose horn is prized as an aphrodisiac in parts of Asia and the Middle East. In the last two decades, the animal's numbers have declined by 90 percent to about 2,000.  In part of an energetic effort by Zimbabwe to protect the species, a member of parliament, Benjamin Moyo, was jailed last month after being convicted of unlawful possession of rhino horns. The white rhinoceros, although more numerous, is threatened as well. Botswana, to Zimbabwe's south, has moved two white rhinos to a sanctuary, in what is the first step of a drive to capture and guard what are believed to be the country's last 10 examples of the species.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EMERGING WOMEN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States was not the only country to experience the &quot;year of the woman&quot; in 1992. Women in the East African nation of Kenya have been busy carving out a spot for themselves in the once all-male political arena. In December, six women won seats in the national assembly, and several women were elected to town and county councils.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the emergence of numerous women's organizations following President Daniel arap Moi's decision to legalize opposition parties in 1991, women began to organize on a broad front and to develop a political agenda.  Women candidates raised concerns about shortages of food products, increasing costs of education, and the lack of sufficient health facilities. Their campaigns pushed these traditional &quot;women's issues&quot; into the discussions about political priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The newly elected members of parliament and local councils say they are hopeful that increasing educational opportunities for women will lead to a greater representation of women at every level of government. Like their American counterparts, Kenyan women are pledging to create a legacy for generations of women to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAYING THE PRICE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been two years since the army of Mali's ex-President Moussa Traore turned their guns on him, refusing to carry out his orders to shoot anti-government protesters. Now, in the wake of Mali's first free elections since independence from France in 1960, the former head of state has been convicted and sentenced to death for the mass killing of 106 pro-democracy demonstrators in the weeks before the soldiers joined the rebellion and ousted him. Three of Traore's senior officers also received death sentences for their part in the killings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers credit Mali's military-led transitional government with setting the pace for democracy in the West African country.  Traore's successor as head of state, Lt. Col. Amadou Toiumani Toure joined with interim Prime Minister Soumana Sacko to organize multiparty elections. A former opposition leader, Alpha Oumar Konare, took over as the newly elected president last June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech at the inauguration, Toure cautioned that reconciliation would serve better than revenge. However, he said Mali's democracy had been bought with a price, and &quot;the country cannot forget those who died while fighting for freedom.&quot; Government officials argue that the deposed leaders' convictions will allow Malians to put the past behind them and get on with the business of implementing the democratic reforms they have long sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNSANCTIONED?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The lifting of diplomatic and economic sanctions against the South African government may be on the horizon, signaling relief for the country's recession stricken economy. In late February, leaders of the African National Congress (ANC) joined efforts to encourage the international community to remove trade limitations, once a date for the nation's first nonracial elections is set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991, the United States and the European Community lifted government bans on trade with South Africa. However, a number of major U.S.  cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles and New York, have maintained local laws barring city business with firms that have ties in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tough sanctions, imposed during the height of the anti-apartheid movement, have had a strong impact on the South African economy. The nation's gross domestic product has continued to decline over the past several years, and economists estimate that over 250,000 jobs have been lost in the past three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC leaders argue that it is time to make efforts to stabilize the economy, starting with fighting the current recession and creating jobs, as a base for democratic developments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following the anti-apartheid group's announcement, the United Nations Human Rights Commission called for international support for South Africa's transition process. The world body cited the need to reward positive change, while issuing notice to F.W. de Klerk's National Party government that arms and oil embargoes will be maintained until the installation of democratic rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO GO OR NOT TO GO?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Gnassingbe Eyadema and his supporters may be home alone if the recent mass exodus from Togo continues. An estimated 250,000 Togolese have fled to neighboring Benin and Ghana, creating a refugee problem that has focused international attention on the continuing political crisis in the small West African country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mounting violence against pro-democracy supporters by the army has created a climate of fear. Eyadema, who took power in a 1967 coup, was forced by public protests in 1991 to agree to formation of a transition government to lead the country to multiparty elections. But Togo's military has remained loyal to the president and has resisted the reforms. Opposition members maintain that troops are using the threat of force to keep the president in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace talks in France last month deadlocked over the issue of ensuring the army's neutrality. Opposition leader, Messan Gnininvi has appealed to France and the United States to mediate to ensure a resumption of peace talks.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a serious challenge to the prime position of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in African policy-making, two new books examine the continent's dramatic decline over a dozen years and challenge the orthodoxies of these, the two most powerful institutions on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alternative Development Strategies in Sub-Saharan Africa, edited by Frances Stewart, Sanjaya Lall and Samuel Wangwe, and Africa's Recovery in the 1990s, edited by Giovanni Andrea Cornia, Rolf van der Hoeven and Thandika Mkandawire, both are published by Macmillan in Britain. The studies are published against the background of Africa's deep economic crisis, which worsened in the 1980s and has continued into the 1990s with little or no sign of improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Richard Jolly, deputy executive director of the United Nations children's agency, Unicef, says Africa remains the highest priority for Unicef's aid because it is the one continent where the health and education status of children has deteriorated in recent years and is projected to worsen further in the 1990s. However, other donors are becoming more inclined to cut their losses and target their aid to places with less record of failure.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The grim economic situation in three-quarters of African countries is disputed by no one, but a bitter intellectual battle rages over the recipes for improvement. Some long-term goals such as industrialization have disappeared almost entirely from current thinking, preoccupied as it is with crisis management.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For over a decade, Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) drawn up by the World Bank and the IMF have been the key policies for Africa. They have focused on the stabilization of macroeconomic imbalances, removal of structural bottlenecks, and economic growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although SAPs have been judged successful in Chile and Indonesia, the programs have had little success in Africa beyond middle-income countries such as Cameroon and Mauritius. And, while bank officials claim at least fragile achievements across the continent, other analysts -- particularly Africans -- blame the harsh regime of SAPs for cuts in employment and in health and education budgets, which have put the entire social fabric at risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past few years, under pressure from Unicef, SAPs have been modified to include the social dimension -- particularly the protection of the poorest, most vulnerable groups. But the decline in per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) continues, and social service cuts mean new generations of less educated, less healthy citizens for the next century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is a greater consensus about the importance of the social dimension, but total consensus certainly has not been achieved,'' says Dr.  Giovanni Andrea Cornia, an economist at Unicef and one of the editors of the optimistically titled Africa's Recovery in the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Frances Stewart introduces Alternative Development Strategies by looking at the contradiction between current policies and long-term</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">objectives. She cites three long-term objectives for Africa: industrial development, increasing food production and human resources development. She then asks how the well-known effects of current policy -- falling employment figures, declining school rolls and shrinking investment in infrastructure -- can be reconciled with those objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bank and the fund are responsible for the policy advice that has brought about these effects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the same advisers encouraged increased production of the primary products that make up 90 percent of Africa's exports, so that their prices have fallen disastrously. Coffee, copper and cotton all have dropped by about 25 percent over the past 30 years. Ten of the continent's 13 major export commodities fell still further last year, including losses of ten percent to 30 percent or more from 1991 levels for cocoa, coffee, cotton and peanut oil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These price trends are not going to be reversed. What could be, Stewart says, is the structure of exports. Her book shows that, compared with South Asia -- where between 1965 and 1987 primary products fell from 63 percent of exports to 36 percent -- in low-income African countries the proportion rose from 92 percent to 94 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among other major problems Stewart identifies is the reduced local control that is a result of the privatization encouraged by SAPs, and the excessive liberalization of imports, which has led, in Ghana for instance, to de-industrialization as the textile industry has collapsed under the impact of imported second-hand clothes from Europe. &quot;African countries basically lost control of their policies in the 1980s,'' she comments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both books emphasize new strategies that the authors -- who include</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">distinguished African economists -- believe could work. These include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * encouragement of indigenous food crops by such policies as subsidies on fertilizers and other inputs, while halting lending to traditional export areas such as coffee;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * commodity price support schemes;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * support for rural non-agricultural development;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * a serious bid for industrialization; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * boosting human resources by increasing the proportion of aid to education and health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most importantly, these strategists propose outright cancellation of at least part of Africa's debt, as well as conversion of what Africa owes the World Bank and the IMF into low-interest, long-term loans. This could reduce such anomalies as the fact that poor African countries paid nearly $200 million more in loan repayments to the IMF last year than they received in assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The measures could free more than $1 billion for African development each year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of these ideas have been put forward repeatedly by Unicef, the United Nations Development Program and the Economic Commission for Africa.  But this approach has a long way to go before being accepted as a real alternative to the unsuccessful World Bank/IMF prescriptions for Africa's desperate situation.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Will more outside aid, trade and investment help the nations of Africa to overcome poverty and develop economically? It is unlikely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most African economies have deteriorated over the past decade, partly because of the policies that underlie the infusions of loans and aid. Trying harder using the same flawed premises won't help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The major element missing from current economic policies is sustainability.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ability of people to engage in productive economic activities through which they can make a living and build a life is not a goal of the global economic order. Neither is the sustainability of the earth's resources. Rather, the primary aim of international economic policies is an ever-greater output of products that can be sold for cash.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The &quot;new global economic order&quot; stresses comparative competitive advantage and export growth. The underlying assumption is that every country will have a comparative advantage in producing and selling something -- and that more production will mean more wealth for more people. But that is not what is happening. In both Africa and the United States, the standard of living of the majority of people is dropping. Only the richest are getting richer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Using the concept of comparative advantage, Western governments and international agencies have often urged African nations to produce export crops instead of food. The assumption is that with the money earned from export sales, cheaper imported food can be substituted for that which had been grown locally. Outside aid, investment and trade are often conditional on Africans' acceptance of the switch from local to export production.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such recommendations conceivably might lead to increased prosperity if the former food producers became instead the producers of exports -- and if they could sell those exports at prices that would enable them to purchase the food and other goods they need. Neither assumption has been borne out in the marketplace. Local producers often find there is no alternative product that they can successfully grow on the same land. Imported food is not &quot;cheaper&quot; if you have nothing with which to buy it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our current policies are further skewed by the limitations of economic policy formulation, such as economists' failure to value the food produced for the family table or for local trade. Food or informal trade that does not become part of the cash economy is not &quot;valued&quot; nor included in calculations of a country's gross national product. In Africa, subsistence agriculture and informal trade have accounted for perhaps 50 percent to 90 percent of what people live from; not to count it surely distorts the policies affecting those people. In addition, a community's state of health, level of education and a host of other quality-of-life factors may be the stuff of political conversation, but they are regarded as &quot;externalities&quot; and omitted from what is &quot;counted&quot; in economic policy decisions. Africans and Americans alike suffer the logic of these limited premises.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most African countries cannot survive using a global model of comparative advantage, in my opinion. Can African countries be economically viable from their own resources? &quot;Yes,&quot; said almost everyone with whom I talked in 17 African countries during a recent trip. But there was general agreement that that won't happen as long as Africa remains bound by an economic model that fails to place a premium on people and their environments, on education, health and community, and on building their future within available resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dominant world economic models do not include these values, but they could. The recent U.S. election reflected a popular recognition that the current economic model is not working to meet the needs of people within a sustainable ecology -- and that change is possible. There is important work taking place at academic and grassroots levels in both Africa and the Americas that supports a wider conceptual framework. We should join forces to bring it into the mainstream.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The past ten years could be described as the era of structural adjustment in sub-Saharan Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under structural adjustment programs, the countries of the region have achieved significant progress. Growth has resumed. Economies have become more responsive to market signals. Boosting agricultural productivity has reoccupied center stage. And rhetoric has been turned into policy on critical issues such as population, the environment and the role of women in development.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process began in response to the economic crisis facing Africa at the beginning of the 1980s. The oil shocks of the preceding decade had placed a heavy burden of debt on African countries, whose economic structures and capacities were already weak. The region had no industrial base; its management capacity was thin; its infrastructure was meager and aging; and it was rapidly losing competitiveness to other developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These conditions would not necessarily have presented Africa with a crisis had they not been compounded by misguided policies on the part of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">African governments: exchange rates were grossly overvalued; exports were excessively taxed; price controls and subsidies were rampant; the state interfered in commerce and trade; and revenues from earlier commodity price booms were poorly managed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In May 1986, at the United Nations Special Session on Africa, African leaders took responsibility for their policy mistakes and committed to undertake the necessary reforms. Today the reform effort has gained widespread acceptance, and 28 countries have adjustment policies in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statistics from a core group of 15 currently adjusting countries that comprise the bulk of Africa's population and income show the following</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">results:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Movements in real producer prices have been favorable for farmers, despite the decline in international prices of primary export commodities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate increased considerably, averaging almost four percent from 1986 to 1990 and three percent in 1991 -- and the positive response is likely much greater than demonstrated by conventional GDP data, which tend to exaggerate the relative importance of the official, public economy and underestimate that of the unofficial, private economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 23 currently adjusting countries, average inflation rates halved, deficits declined, military expenditures have been slashed and exports are up.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The overriding mission of the World Bank is to alleviate poverty, and its adjustment programs aim first and foremost to improve the quality of life for the majority of Africans who live in abject poverty. There is no doubt that, over time, reform measures will succeed in stimulating economic growth, and the poor will gain from the opportunities available in a more vibrant economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, even in the short run, most of Africa's poor have benefited from reforms. Eighty percent to 90 percent of the continent's poor are small- holder farmers who are net producers of tradable goods. Adjustment policies -- which usually include elimination of agricultural marketing monopolies, higher crop prices and lower taxation of agriculture -- have increased the income of this group. This, in turn, has led to greater food production, greater production of export crops and higher rural employment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Contrary to some claims, the increase in the production of cash crops has not come at the expense of food production. In Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso, for example, per capita food production is much higher today than in the pre-adjustment period, while the volume of agricultural exports has risen at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa's urban poor, who number between four percent and 20 percent of the poor in counties in the region, have suffered in some cases, especially as a result of higher food prices. In the medium to long term, however, the urban poor will benefit from accelerated growth spurred by adjustment, because most of the demand for goods and services they produce and trade originates from the rural poor whose incomes rise under adjustment. It is no accident, for example, that where adjustment has been consistently pursued and growth is being restored, as in Ghana, urban wages have begun to recover as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another clear indication of the benefits of adjustment for the poor is that, with only a few exceptions, real levels of government expenditures for education and health increased in adjusting countries. In recent years the bank has been paying increasing attention to such spending. In 1989-90, a third of adjustment loans mandated social sector spending, up sharply from seven percent in the first half of the 1980s. The restructuring of social expenditures to favor primary education and health services, as well as safety nets, offers substantial scope both for mitigating the short-term costs of adjustment and for improving the poor's human capital and earning potential in the long run. The bank is also intensifying its collaboration with governments to design and support social-action programs aimed at protecting the poor who might otherwise be adversely affected by structural adjustment programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, the bank can claim a number of achievements in promoting economic reform in sub-Saharan Africa. It has succeeded in creating a group of economic managers on the continent who are knowledgeable and confident about what has gone wrong and what is required to fix it; it has encouraged a revitalization of economic activity, as domestic actors in the economy have responded to new market opportunities; and through the reform effort, it has been instrumental in rejuvenating the donor commitment to Africa, ensuring that African countries receive enough external funding to sustain progress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Notwithstanding these achievements, there are a number of important lessons which the bank, the donor community and African governments must consider if the reform effort is to be successfully consolidated and deepened. The most important of these is the realization that changing the structure of an economy is a long-term process. Many of the mistakes made by governments and donors over the last 30 years were caused by an unrealistic view of the time required to create the necessary conditions for development in Africa, resulting in programs which were overly ambitious. This is why it is absolutely critical in the coming years for donors and African governments to maintain the commitment and the stamina for reform, even where progress is only modest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another important lesson is that ownership of reforms, not only by the government, but by the incipient economic actors in the country, is crucial to their success. No amount of externally imposed conditionalities, however benign and beneficial, will turn an economy around. The bank is actively seeking to increase the number of private sector, non-governmental, labor and other groups in its projects and programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 1990s will be a critical decade for the region. Those countries that have recovered must do so fully in order to sustain progress into the next century, and those that have not must recover in order to avoid economic and social chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the challenges are enormous, this is not an insurmountable task.  The dialogue among and between governments, international organizations and beneficiaries has vastly improved. The lessons of experience have been powerful. The strategic agenda has by and large been set. And the mechanisms for achieving Africa's development objectives are in place. The task now is to strengthen what has been accomplished and to ensure that future investments work with maximum efficiency.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mozambique</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Squash Soup</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Mozambican who inspired this recipe cooks it differently each time he makes it, depending on what is fresh in the market and what spices he can get. The squash most frequently available in Mozambique is similar to the giant West Indian or Caribbean variety that can be found in parts of Canada and the United States. Butternut is another good choice, but any winter squash will do. It's the method that's important here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serves 6 as a first course or 4 as a light meal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1-2 lbs. squash, peeled and cubed</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 bay leaf</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4 or 5 large garlic cloves, crushed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 tblsp. onion, minced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 tblsp. oil or butter 1 tsp. salt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/8 tsp. black pepper 1 tsp. fresh ginger, grated</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/4 tsp. curry powder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/8 tsp. paprika</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1-3 tblsp. lemon juice</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boil squash in just enough water to cover. (If the squash is extremely hard, you might want to boil it whole or in large chunks until it becomes soft enough to peel and chop more easily.) When the pieces are very soft, lift them out, leaving the water in the pan. Mash the squash with a fork, or put it through a sieve. Return squash to cooking water, add the bay leaf and simmer gently. Meanwhile, saute the crushed garlic and the onion in the oil or butter. Combine the remaining spices and then add them to the butter mixture. Saute over low heat for five to ten minutes until the flavors are well blended. Spoon a little of the squash liquid into the skillet with the butter mixture; stir and then pour the mixture into the soup pan. Add water to make</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">about 6 cups, and stir in lemon juice to taste. Variations: Chicken stock may be used instead of water, and other vegetables may be added. Among other spices that work well in this soup are coriander, fennel, celery seed, rosemary and cayenne pepper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghana</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hkatenkwan (Peanut Stew)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serves 4-6</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Across much of Africa, soups and stews made with peanuts -- usually called &quot;groundnuts&quot; -- are staple main-meal foods. Depending on the hotness of your chilies or your cayenne, this version may be uncomfortably spicy.  Unless you relish very hot foods, begin with no more than half the pepper specified here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3-lb chicken, cut into pieces</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/2 of a whole onion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 tblsp. tomato paste</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 tblsp. peanut oil or other light cooking oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 cup onion, well chopped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 cup tomatoes, chopped</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2/3 cup peanut butter</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 tsp. salt</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 tsp. grated fresh ginger,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 hot chilies, crushed,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or 1 tsp. ground ginger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> or 1 tsp. cayenne powder</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 cups fresh or frozen okra</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 medium-size eggplant, peeled and cubed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boil chicken with ginger and the onion half, using about 2 cups water.  Meanwhile, in a separate large pot, fry tomato paste in the oil over low heat for about five minutes. Add to the paste the chopped onions and tomatoes, stirring occasionally until the onions are clear. Remove the partially cooked chicken pieces and put them, along with about half the broth, in the large pot. Add the peanut butter, salt and peppers. Cook for five minutes before stirring in the eggplant and okra. Continue cooking until chicken and vegetables are tender. Add more broth as needed to maintain a thick, stewy consistency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To make this a vegetarian dish, substitute 2 vegetable bouillon cubes for the chicken. Or make fewer pieces of chicken go farther by removing meat from the bone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like many West African foods, this stew is rather peppery. If mild foods are more your style, reduce the amount of peppers or cayenne. Serve over rice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Algeria</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chlada Felfel (Tomato and Green Pepper Salad)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serves 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This North African salad is similar to salads found on many African tables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 large green bell peppers 2 cloves garlic, minced and crushed</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4 tblsp. olive oil 1/2 tblsp. wine vinegar</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/2 tsp. salt handful of green olives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/4 tsp. pepper handful of black olives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> several anchovies (optional) 2 large ripe tomatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Broil the green peppers in an oven for several minutes, turning them three or four times, until the skin blisters. When they're cool enought to handle, peel, seed and chop them. Pile in the center of a serving plate, and arrange tomato slices around them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prepare a vinaigrette by mixing olive oil, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper. Pour over the vegetables. Decorate with olives and anchovies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cape Verde</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Banana Enrolada (Banana Rolled in Pastry)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Serves 4</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This elegant dessert is fun to make, especially when children are involved, and is universally popular. It's tasty hot or cold, alone or with ice cream.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 1/2 cups flour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2 tblsp. sugar (optional)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1/2 tsp. salt 4 very ripe bananas</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> oil for frying 6 tblsp. butter, softened,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> cinnamon or 6 tblsp. vegetable oil</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Combine flour, sugar and salt in a mixing bowl. With your fingertips, work the butter into the flour mixture until it is well distributed. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, until you have a dough that will hold together in a ball. (If you have time, cover the pastry and refrigerate it for 30 minutes at this point.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turn the ball out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into four parts. Roll each part into an oblong that is an inch or so longer than your bananas and wide enough to wrap around one. Lay a banana on each oblong, and roll it up in the pastry, sealing the edges and ends by pinching with your fingertips. For smaller servings, or if your bananas are large, cut each banana in half before rolling the pieces in pastry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deep fry the pastry-wrapped bananas, or fry them in an inch or so of hot oil in a large, heavy skillet for three or four minutes on each side.  When done, they should be crisp and golden brown outside and soft and moist inside. Drain on clean, absorbent cloths to absorb excess oil, and sprinkle with cinnamon before serving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ginger Beer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Homemade soft drinks brewed from fresh ginger can be found all across sub-Saharan Africa. They are made at varying ratios of water to ginger, and fruits of many varieties -- such as pineapples and guavas -- may be substituted for the citrus. This recipe produces a strong concentrate that can be diluted with equal parts water for drinking, but many people like it just as it is, over ice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 16 ounces (or a couple of large</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> handfuls) fresh ginger</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> juice of 1 or 2 limes 1 stick cinnamon (optional)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1 tsp. whole cloves (optional)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> sugar to taste</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Wash the ginger and peel it, being careful to remove only the outer layer of skin. Grind or pound to a pulp, and place in a large, heat-proof container that is enameled or made of glass or stainless steel. Cover with 1/2 gallon (8 cups) of boiling water. Set the mixture aside in a warm place.  (You may want to protect it from dust by covering the container loosely with a cloth.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After an hour or so, strain the liquid through a cloth, squeezing the pulp to extract all the flavor. Stir in lime juice, cinnamon, half the cloves and 1/2 gallon of cold water. Let the liquid sit for another hour, in the sun if possible, which allows the starch from the ginger to settle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pour the mixture gently through a cloth to strain it, trying not to disturb any sediment at the bottom. Strain again if necessary. Stir in the remaining cloves, add sugar if desired, then transfer the ginger beer to a jar and refrigerate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c6">THE UNDISCOVERED DELIGHT OF AFRICAN CUISINE</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">920 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elegant cuisine may not be the first image that springs to mind when African food is mentioned, but more and more people are discovering an Africa whose culinary riches rival those of any continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From the spicy, savory stews of North and West Africa to the soothing porridges and fiery curries of the east and south, African foods are a feast of color and aroma as well as taste. An African marketplace is a kaleidoscope of milky coconut, amber palm oil, and pyramidal mounds of spices in hues of ocher, rust and saffron. The brash greens and vibrant yellows of avocados and bananas complement the wrinkled browns of fresh lychees and grenadillas, which hide their intensity under cloaks of drabness.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somehow, no other food is quite so tasty as the smoky beef brochettes in a Moroccan souk or the tangy slices of guava and mango sold on a Mozambican roadside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By tradition -- and in rural areas by necessity -- African cooks</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">employ the ingredients used by fine chefs everywhere: minimally processed grains, fresh, vine-ripened fruits and vegetables, just-snipped herbs and hand-pounded spices. The locally grown produce is less likely to be laced with toxic chemicals than the foods in Western supermarkets. Chicken, meat, eggs and milk are likely to come from free-range animals, and the seafood served at an evening meal was probably in the ocean when the day dawned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Such descriptions may be surprising to those who think of Africa as a continent of food shortages, and it is tragically true that many Africans today face famine. But that reality is more a by-product of 20th-century geopolitics -- exacerbated periodically by unfavorable weather -- than it is representative of Africa's past or its customs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African meals traditionally have been no less varied -- and often more healthful -- than the high-protein, high-fat diets of the Western world.  Travelers in previous centuries marveled at the abundance of Africa's berries and nuts, domestic animals and wild game, dates, and honey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in accounts of their journeys, the earliest European voyagers exulted over the spices they found. For hundreds of years, Alexandria, Egypt, was the world's leading spice trading center, and the romantic scenes evoked by names such as Zanzibar, Marrakech and Timbuktu date from their importance as points of exchange for spices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It would be a mistake to generalize about Africa's ways of eating. The continent is larger and more diverse than most Americans realize. Its 54 countries span a vast area; the nation of Sudan alone is larger than the United States east of the Mississippi River. Topography ranging from lush rain forests to snowy pinnacles -- as well as climates from arid to tropical -- have spawned distinct cuisines as different from one another as, for example, those of Turkey and Sweden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But many Americans, particularly those who live in the southern United States, are more familiar with some of Africa's foods than they realize.  Peanuts and rice, okra and yams, sesame and cumin are all among the foods and flavorings brought to colonial America from Africa. African influences are pervasive, from the jumbalayas and gumbos of Louisiana bayous to the hoe cakes and corn breads of Georgia. Indeed, &quot;gumbo&quot; is the West African word for okra, and &quot;yam&quot; is derived from the West African verb nyami, which means &quot;to eat.&quot; Even our word &quot;banana&quot; came to America from Africa, by way of Portuguese explorers, with its spelling intact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The increasing numbers of Americans who have lived in or traveled extensively in Africa -- such as more than 80,000 former Peace Corps volunteers -- have contributed to a growing awareness of Africa's ways of eating. And the popularity of African restaurants in major cities testifies to a widening appreciation of the continent's culinary delights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, the only way for most Americans to eat African dishes is to cook them. That process is not as strange or difficult as might be imagined, although it is true that Africans, like all good chefs, don't cook &quot;by the book.&quot; Getting a recipe from an accomplished African cook often requires following someone around for a day, carefully measuring the ingredients used and noting the procedures. And even then, the resulting recipe is more a benchmark than a formula; it is designed to be changed and adapted according to what is on hand and the mood of the cook.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The following recipes, adapted from The Africa News Cookbook: African Cooking for Western Kitchens, can easily accommodate substitutions and innovations. Although drawn from countries far from one another, these foods work together to make a meal fit to serve to the most discriminating connoisseurs.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Harry Amana for Africa News Service</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1120 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than anything else, the creative and extremely listenable &quot;Jazz in Africa&quot; volumes are about the rediscovery of the late Kippie Moeketsi, the legendary South African alto saxophone player who mentored Hugh Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim and Jonas Gwangwa in the late 1950s, created outstanding music in spite of apartheid, and who is known as &quot;the father of South African music.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the liner notes explain, Moeketsi, Masekela, Ibrahim, then called Dollar Brand, and Gwangwa formed the nucleus of The Jazz Epistles, a township group that folded around 1959, after it had become the first black South African group to release an album -- a very limited distribution record of less than 500 copies. Seeking creative freedom from a racist white record industry and a chance to have their music heard, Masekela and Ibrahim left the country soon after the recording and lived in exile for three decades, astonishing Europe and the United States with their new &quot;Township Jazz&quot; sounds. Gwangwa would also leave and become a member of Masekela's Union of South Africa group of the early 1970s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Moeketsi stayed in country, playing in the townships, recording another album during the 1970s and building on his growing legend. By the time of his death in May 1983, he was an almost mythical figure, whose first record with the Epistles was a collector's item.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, with Volume I of the remastered &quot;lost tracks,&quot; we hear the entire 1959, 14-song recording, featuring the young Masekela, Gwangwa and Ibrahim, with their trailblazing mentor playing masterfully in sextet ensembles the hip and swinging classical jazz of that era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Volume II, we are treated to six tunes cut in the 1970s, four of which feature the Township Jazz of Moeketsi in some dynamic, completely original, mind-blowing solos. Together, the two volumes explain why Moeketsi's playing is mentioned by knowledgeable insiders in the same breath as Charlie Parker and John Coltrane and why his arrangements and original pieces are compared favorably with Thelonius Monk and Dizzy Gillespie.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Volume I includes 14 songs: five standards (&quot;Delilah,&quot; &quot;Yardbird Suite,&quot; &quot;Body &amp; Soul,&quot; &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot; and &quot;Old Devil Moon&quot;), two South African traditional songs (&quot;Twelve to Twelve&quot; and &quot;Cosmic Ray&quot;) and seven originals, including three each by Moeketsi and Ibrahim, and one by Masekela. Accompanying them in the sextet are Gwangwa on trombone; Claude Shange, bass; and Gene Latimore, drums. On six tracks, John Mehegan replaces Ibrahim on keyboard and Christopher Joseph plays keyboard on &quot;Delilah.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What this volume reveals is the technical virtuosity of the young musicians and the confidence and originality of Moeketsi. In a four-minute solo on &quot;Body &amp; Soul,&quot; he overpowers his instrument in the manner of Coltrane, Pharaoh Sanders or Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Then in a cut of his own entitled &quot;Scullery Department,&quot; he and the sextet create a seven-minute whimsical, sardonic, subversive tune reminiscent of Dizzy or Monk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other highlights of this volume include Moeketsi's rhythmically complex &quot;Carols Drive,&quot; the almost angry, or maybe just pissed off, &quot;Blues for Hughie&quot; and Ibrahim's &quot;Gafsa,&quot; a four-and-a-half- minute piano solo.  Masekela and Gwangwa are strong on all pieces, and Shange performs an exceptional penny whistle solo on the nine-and-a-half-minute &quot;Cosmic Ray,&quot; a traditional African song.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Volume II is a six-song tour de force of the Township Jazz made popular in the United States in the '60s and '70s, especially by Miriam Makeba and Masekela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three of the four Moeketsi-featured songs are quintets with Basil Coetzee on tenor; Pat Matshikiza, piano; Alec Khaoli, bass; and Sipho Mabuse, drums. Dennis Phillips, also on alto, is added for the first cut, &quot;Tshona,&quot; a Matshikiza creation arranged by Moeketsi. &quot;Tshona&quot; is a brilliant 12-minute laid-back arrangement whose three saxes sometimes come in so strong that they create, for sustained intervals, a big-band feeling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also significant is Moeketsi's &quot;Umgababa,&quot; an 11-minute call-and- response arrangement of saxes answering a pulsating, insistent rhythm section.&quot;Africa Day&quot; is a sextet performance with Coetzee, Barney Rachabane and Duke Makasi on tenors; Tete Mbambisa, piano; Sipho Gumede, bass; and Gilbert Matthews, drums. All of the saxes perform innovative solos, grounded, again, by a solid driving rhythm section.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last piece, &quot;Kalahari,&quot; is a 23-minute masterpiece by Ibrahim.  With Ibrahim and Coetzee are Robbie Jansen on alto; Arthur Jacobs, tenor; Lionel Beukes, bass; and Nazier Kapdi, drums. This is an exotic, funky, percussion-driven -- almost Afro-Cuban -- ceremony that includes chanting</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">male voices and the recitation of a poem by Ibrahim:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Behold the night and day</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gently they give way to each other</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear brother.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the darkness, I met him of the night</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With arms full of love light.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Carry one,&quot; said he, &quot;Into the vast night.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;All right,&quot; I said. &quot;Just guide me;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just guide me with your light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The two volumes are a must-buy for any collector who wants to fill in the gaps on the so-called &quot;Modern Jazz&quot; era or who wants to add to her collection some seminal sounds of the Township Jazz or Afro-Pop movements.  They're also a good buy for anyone who loves the music and wants exposure to Kippie Moeketsi, a musical genius whose sounds apartheid almost took from us forever.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As long as the 13th Pan African Film Festival is in town, all life in &quot;Ouaga&quot; centers around the pool at the Hotel Independence. It is here that every filmmaker, distributor, producer and phony will gather in search of a deal. From eight in the morning to well past midnight they meet over soft drinks or cognac. Internationally acclaimed director Ousmane Sembene hops from one interview to the next, while a first-time filmmaker must hand out posters and press kits personally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fespaco, as it is known, is less a festival than a trade show -- a sprawling African market with buyers and sellers and thousands of onlookers from all over the world who descend on this town for one week every two years in hopes of scoring the big prize.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year's winner of the Yennenga Stallion, the top award, goes to Roger Mbala of Cote d'Ivoire for his film &quot;Au Nom du Christ&quot; (&quot;In the Name of Christ&quot;), a last-minute entry that was still being edited in mid- February.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is impossible to see more than a small portion of the festival's movies; more than 200 are screened at theaters scattered all over town -- the capital of this country that used to be called Dahomey. Among the hottest films are &quot;Malcolm X,&quot; dubbed to French, &quot;Gito L'Ingrat,&quot; the first feature film produced in the tiny East African nation of Burundi, and &quot;Thomas Sankara,&quot; a documentary about the assassinated leader of this country that drew raves and tears from the audience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to an observer, what emerges at Fespaco is more than just good films and bad. Questions about the future of Africa -- both it's dreams and its delusions -- seem embodied in the proceedings. The films are like the continent in microcosm. Most are heavily funded by French and German television, international aid organizations or the governments of their countries of origin. So when banners around the city proclaim the theme of this year's Fespaco as &quot;Cinema and Liberties,&quot; a certain sense of irony is inevitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The sad fact is that African films are not only struggling to be free, they're having a hard time being seen. &quot;Africa is the worst place to see African films,&quot; says Simon Bright, a filmmaker from Zimbabwe and chairman of the filmmakers' congress here.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The screens on this continent are dominated by movies from Hollywood and Bombay, and theater owners are reluctant to book anything that doesn't feature Arnold Schwarzenegger smashing a truck. Though one film from Zimbabwe outgrossed &quot;Terminator 2&quot; in Southern Africa, the film's producer is struggling just to get it booked into Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even the directors themselves seem to have their sights set on broader horizons. Because the Cannes Film Festival won't accept films that have competed elsewhere, the directors of several major films would not enter their works into competition here. The result is that most competitors at Fespaco represent a kind of second-string of African films.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, like Africa, the atmosphere in Ouagadougou is electric and full of hope. There is sincerity and determination among the participants. They all seem to recognize the importance of creating and sustaining a cinema that is uniquely African so that the world can see what Africa thinks of itself.  Or, as Sembene himself agreed, &quot;To be an African filmmaker is not only a right, it is a responsibility.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Entry requirements: North American tourists staying less than three months need no visas. Requirements for nationals of other countries differ.  You must bring proof of a valid yellow fever inoculation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arrival: A visit to Yamoussoukro begins in Abidjan, a seaside city of lagoons and peninsulas. There are direct flights to Abidjan from New York via Air Afrique, from Paris via Air France and from Zurich via Swissair. Abidjan has numerous attractions and plentiful hotels and restaurants. Accommodations at nearby beaches range from exclusive resorts, including a Club Med, to quiet coastal hideaways. Air Ivoire flies to Yamoussoukro, or you can rent a car and drive there.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Packing: May to October in Abidjan tends to be rainy, with a dry spell in August. Temperatures are often moderate, occasionally chilly and rarely rise above the high 80's Fahrenheit. Yamoussoukro is slightly hotter and drier. Small appliances with dual voltage work, but you'll need a French-style converter plug. Batteries, film and almost anything you're likely to need are available in Abidjan shops. At night, socks and long sleeves are advisable, because malaria-carrying mosquitoes bite only after dusk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Health Tips: The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) advises that the two most important precautions before leaving home are having an immune globulin shot, also known as gamma globulin, to reduce the risks of hepatitis, and beginning a course of anti-malaria medication. CDC's 24-hour hotline, (404) 332-4559, gives information on malaria prevention as well as other health advice. As in any developing country, it's safest not to eat uncooked vegetables and fruits unless you can peel them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Currency: The Central African Franc, or CFA, is a convertible currency used throughout French-speaking West Africa. It can be changed at banks and airports in Cote d'Ivoire, but also in major cities such as Paris and New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accommodations: In Yamoussoukro, the President Hotel is pricey, about $120 and up, and is the only truly international hotel. Discounts are sometimes available for the asking. Several other hotels offer varying prices and amenities. It's best to check them out in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Food: In addition to the costly rooftop restaurant at the President and its more moderate poolside dining room and terrace, Yamoussoukro has restaurants serving Chinese and Italian food and a French-style creperie. For authentic African cuisine, Chez Valentine is fairly expensive but good. Local musicians often play for diners at the open-air pavilions. Outside the small downtown area, in residential neighborhoods, streetside restaurants called maquis serve such fare as grilled chicken for modest prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Presidential House: The residence and grounds are off-limits unless you're an invited guest, but outside the wall is one of Yamoussoukro's few regularly scheduled attractions. Twice a day, staff members preside over the feeding of live chickens to crocodiles that lurk in a cement moat by the gates. Adopted by Houphou t-Boigny as a symbol of his family and his rule, the crocodiles function as a kind of live coat of arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Basilica: The church is open regularly; check the bulletin at the President Hotel, or ask at the desk, for precise hours of tours and worship services.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Approaching the capital of Cote d'Ivoire, where the narrow route from the coast broadens into a six-lane divided highway, is like traveling the yellow brick road. In the distance, across the scrubby West African landscape, a storybook dome seems suspended in midair, ghostly in the shimmering afternoon heat, its gilded ribs catching slanting shafts of sun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over 150 miles from the metropolis of Abidjan, with its skyscrapers and 3 million people, the world's largest church sits at the end of a broad boulevard in a town of 30,000 residents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace has been controversial since it was built at an estimated cost of $200 million to $250 million. Cote d'Ivoire's aging president, Felix Houphou t-Boigny, says he paid for the majestic structure from his personal fortune, siting it at his birthplace in the village of Yamoussoukro, which he named the nation's capital in 1983. But a few months before the basilica was consecrated by Pope John Paul II in 1990, protests and strikes in the streets of Abidjan called attention to the widespread public view that the building represents the excesses of many of Africa's post-colonial rulers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the demonstrations forced the president to agree to legalize opposition political parties and to tolerate independent newspapers, the charges that Houphou t-Boigny had diverted government funds to the basilica died down. And although the church still is ridiculed by critics, some now say that the country should reap what benefits it can from visitors to the structure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, the building is imposing -- its soaring structure appearing strangely at home in its unusual setting. Perhaps only an edifice of such magnitude can compete with the majesty of vast African spaces. The silvered patina of marble and stone looks less like a mirage close-up, but the earth tones harmonize with the setting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The inside is more dissonant, with its panels of imported stained glass in 4,000 shades and its ornate painted surfaces. State-of-the-art climate and acoustic systems reduce echoes and keep the towering sanctuary evenly cooled for as many as 18,000 worshippers. Another 300,000 people can be accommodated on the marble plaza outside or stroll in the 88 acres of French-style formal gardens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On a typical day, though, there are more guides than visitors.  Helpful, friendly staff will whisk you in a soundless elevator for a rooftop view across the 40-room adjoining mansion reserved for papal visits. Openly proud of the church, the guides and guards point out that the great cathedrals of Europe, now revered by throngs of tourists as well as locals, were built alongside poverty as desperate as anything in Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's hard to imagine throngs anywhere in Yamoussoukro, though. The luxury President Hotel, with sprawling swimming pools, tennis and squash courts and one of West Africa's finest golf courses, has an occupancy rate of about 15 percent. Except when a meeting or conference crowds the facility, giving it the air of a plush tropical resort, the President seems like a private mansion, its staff of servants the relic of a large family whose members have dwindled and moved away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normally, no reservations are needed at the rooftop restaurant, where the Parisian cuisine seems mildly surprising as an accompaniment to the 23rd-floor vista over African forest and grassland. From that vantage point, the town reveals itself as still a village, making scarcely a dent in the surrounding countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The perspective from street level is even more bemusing. The drive to build a capital city seems to have lacked only people. Two institutions of higher learning, a ruling party headquarters reminiscent of Lincoln Center, and a foundation named after the president sit virtually unoccupied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From time to time, though, the bucolic atmosphere is disrupted by the arrival of a prominent international visitor. Near the basilica, Houphou t-Boigny has built a French-modern style presidential palace, surrounded by a half-mile-long wall of granite, where he likes to receive prominent guests. Often he flies ahead, ready to greet them when they arrive from Abidjan. A typical welcome involves hundreds of dancers and drummers in traditional dress, lining what appear to be miles of red carpet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The palace itself, with its sleek balconies, hushed corridors and gold faucets, is like a generic luxury hotel -- the modern kind that holds itself aloof from local architecture or ambiance. It could be anywhere, or at least anywhere where money is no object.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In contrast to the stark order of church and state, the town's residential areas are alive and colorful. Where the broad boulevards boast miles of high wattage street lights, the small cafes and shops of Yamoussoukro's neighborhoods use kerosene lamps and candles to supplement dim bare bulbs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At dusk, especially during Ramadan, the month of daylight fasting observed by Muslims, vendors wheel out carts of freshly roasted plantains, grilled meats and other foods to break the fast. The flickering lights, the clink of glasses and the convivial atmosphere suggest a street party at which all passers-by are welcome.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yamoussoukro sits on a rough dividing line between the Muslim north and the Christian south. Almost twice as many Ivorians are Muslim -- about 30 percent of the population -- as Christian. During the basilica's construction, the French site manager told a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor that the church is a symbol that the southward spread of Islam from North Africa must stop at the town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> About a half mile from the Our Lady of Peace, the minaret of a mosque also gleams in the afternoon sunlight. Although not nearly as grand as the basilica, it too is intricate and beautiful and built, it is said, with financial help from the president. Echoing from its tower, the call of the faithful to prayer can be heard each day in the gardens and plazas of the church, where Muslim workers and visitors pause in their affairs to kneel toward Mecca and pray.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On stage, Barbara Hendricks sparkles. Off stage, too. With the singer from Stephens, Arkansas, what you see is apparently what you get.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rehearsing for a performance with the New York Philharmonic, she is casual, flexible, ready to sing at conductor Gerard Schwarz's signal or to wait patiently while he works with the musicians, even though the hall is drafty and she is nursing a cold. There's no hint of temperament, no air of a diva -- a role she figuratively rejected when offered the part of an opera star in the 1982 French film of that name (which went on to become an international hit with an unknown actress).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What there is with Barbara Hendricks is a quick, concentrated seriousness when it's time to sing; then a sudden joyous cascade of apparently effortless sound. Afterward, appreciative orchestra members tap their bows against their instruments in the rehearsal hall's refined version of resounding applause.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New York Times music critic Edward Rothstein called her performance the following evening &quot;exquisite.&quot; Her voice, he said, has &quot;a ringing ...  that gives it both a porcelain fragility and an edginess.&quot; The legendary former music director of the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic orchestras, Herbert von Karajan, compared her to Maria Callas in &quot;passion and interpretative possibility.&quot; If there is criticism of her work, it tends to be a matter of personal preference. Her voice is described as &quot;pretty&quot; rather than &quot;big.&quot; Her fans say it is her unforced naturalness that gives her such charm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In person, she exhibits the same quality. Between rehearsal and performance, postponing a visit to the doctor in order to talk about refugees, she is warm, funny, passionate and very definitely pretty.  Glamorous, even, in an understated elegant way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm real lucky and I know it,&quot; she says about her musical gifts. &quot;I try to make it possible for the music to touch us in that place where we're alike.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So in addition to singing before affluent audiences in fabled opera houses, she sings to, and with, some of the world's most destitute people.  Not performances, just a cappella songs &quot;to give an idea of what I do for a living,&quot; she says. For the last six years she has been a Goodwill Ambassador with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a volunteer job that berths her in primitive shelters in remote locations in Africa, Asia and other parts of the globe for days at a time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugee officials say she makes no demands and expects no special treatment, perhaps because in the refugee camps she believes she is with her constituency. &quot;I'm not an ambassador to refugees,&quot; she insists, making a distinction she clearly feels is crucial. &quot;I'm their ambassador. My purpose is to tell their story. And part of that story is that they're just like us.  Any of us could find ourselves in the same situation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa is of special interest to her because of its high percentage of refugees. A third of the world's 17 million displaced people are African. But where many visitors to crisis areas become discouraged, Barbara Hendricks finds reason for hope. &quot;Another part of the refugee story, which is very important to me,&quot; she says, &quot;is to take away, a little bit, this image refugees have of having their hands out.&quot; Instead of dependence, Hendricks sees resilience, grit and spirit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And she says that she is astonished, always, by the generosity of the poor. She mentions a visit to camps for Mozambican refugees in the southern African nation of Zambia, where she saw an outpouring of assistance and sharing from Zambia's people -- themselves impoverished -- toward the victims of war in their midst. &quot;The Zambians had given 300 square kilometers of land, and on that land they had built 40 villages, 18 of which, after two years, were self-sufficient.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between performances and UN work, Hendricks returns to her home in Switzerland, to her husband and manager, Martin Engstrom, and their young children, Jamie and Sebastien. It's &quot;really tough,&quot; she says, speaking both of leaving her own children while she travels and of her compassion, as a mother, for the children she sees in her refugee work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pleasures of her own homecomings give her a heightened appreciation of the need for refugees to return to their homes or to make new ones. She is especially glad to be able to tell refugee success stories, like the repatriation of refugees to Namibia, the southwest African nation that celebrates its third anniversary of independence this month. &quot;People see so much on television,&quot; she says, referring to the population of wealthy countries. &quot;It's really hard to keep seeing suffering, so people just sort of become immune to it. But I think we must find in ourselves this feeling, which I believe is inherent in every human being, to know that we are somehow connected to everything that happens in the world, to everyone in the world.  And we must find some way of contributing to humanity and contributing to that connection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She comes to such thoughts as naturally as to her music. The daughter of a schoolteacher and a Methodist minister, she sang in church choirs before becoming a chemistry and mathematics major in college. Singing professionally came about by chance or by providence, depending on your viewpoint, when a trustee of the Aspen Institute in Colorado heard her perform at a community event and invited her to Aspen's summer institute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There she met Jennie Tourel, a Russian-born music teacher who persuaded Hendricks to come study with her at Julliard. The influence of Tourel on her life is a reason Hendricks cites for her feeling of kinship to refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She was a Russian Jew,&quot; she says. &quot;She left France during the Second World War in the last boat that was allowed to come out to America. Without that suffering she had to go through and without the fact that she was a refugee, I don't see how I would be where I am today.&quot; Hendricks says she regularly sees ways that refugees enrich the lives of the people they encounter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although she comes on so gently that her passions are disarming rather than off-putting, Hendricks is not uncomfortable being labeled a crusader. &quot;I suppose I got on this wave as a student at university,&quot; she says, &quot;because I sort of missed the active part of the civil rights movement and became very active in the women's movement. (I was) one of the original feminists, I like to say.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was partly the struggles that swirled around her and those she participated in that led her to work with Amnesty International and then with the UN refugee program. &quot;I realized,&quot; she says, &quot;that there had to be some set of rights that included everyone and excluded no one -- men and women, blacks and whites. And whatever differences we wanted to have between us, there had to be a foundation for being able to resolve those differences without resorting to war, barbarism, destruction.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The election of Bill Clinton has given Barbara Hendricks new avenues to promote those ideals. She was invited to sing at the inaugural gala on January 19, where she received a sustained ovation from the festive crowd.  Tom Shales, writing in the Washington Post, called her performance &quot;stunning.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was thrilling.&quot; she said the next morning, en route to the swearing-in ceremony. Was she nervous? No, she said. &quot;I was excited. I wanted to meet the occasion, to be up to the occasion.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before she left for Washington, her son asked if she had gone to school with the new president, if she had known him. &quot;I said, 'No. If he and I had been living in the same neighborhood, we couldn't have gone to the same school.' Living in an integrated community, it took him a while to grasp the fact. I don't think he really did.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in true Hendricks style, singing for the president served a larger purpose. &quot;I promised him that I'll visit him in April,&quot; she says. She plans to bring her family with her for an Easter-time concert in Miami. She'll take the children to Disney World and she'll talk to Bill Clinton about refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I will convince him to go to Africa,&quot; she says confidently. &quot;It's so low on the totem pole. I want him to experience the richness of the people, to know who they are, so he can't forget them. I'll tell him about my experiences and where I feel he can help unlock doors that have been closed.&quot; She'll trade on their common Arkansas background, if she needs to, but she believes that Clinton is open to ideas and ready to listen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The chance to have him listen to her talk is as satisfying as having people listen to her sing. When she thinks she can alleviate pain and injustice, she is both compelled to act and grateful for the chance to make a difference. &quot;The post that I have at the UNHCR,&quot; she says, &quot;is really a gift for me.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 26 of the last 37 years, successive Sudanese governments, all dominated by Muslim Arabs, have fought to crush an autonomy movement of black southerners who are largely Christian and animist. The current government, which seized power in a 1989 coup, has stepped up both the number and the brutality of its attacks, as have the rebels on their side.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Over half a million people, mostly southerners, have died in the last ten years alone, and 4.5 million are homeless. Aid officials say the plight of southern Sudan is the world's most ignored large-scale disaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In December, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to condemn Sudan's militant Islamic government for human rights abuses. Last month Amnesty International issued a report charging Sudan with gross abuses, including killing or otherwise silencing critics and conducting &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; operations in areas of the country outside the scrutiny of international observers. The report said the rebels, too, are rights violators. Amnesty urged the international community to take &quot;decisive action on behalf of human rights in Sudan.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">KHARTOUM, Sudan</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As reports of disease and starvation continue to emerge from war- ravaged southern Sudan, the Islamic-backed government in the north continues to consolidate its hold on power. Gen. Omar Hassan Amad El Bashir, who seized power three years ago, has succeeded in maintaining control with the backing of the country's most influential religious leader, Hassan Al Turabi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Turabi says he has no official role in the Sudanese government -- identifying himself only as a spiritual advisor -- it is clear that he is very much involved in an effort to turn his country into the world's ideal Islamic state, free of corruption, of hunger and, most of all, of dependence on foreign money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi has been described as the power behind the Khartoum government.  He has long been associated with Sudan's Popular Islamic Front, which helped to unseat the former regime, and with the Muslim Brotherhood and its branches around the world. Turabi's religious credentials give the government the moral authority it needs to hold onto power, and his acclaim as a progressive Islamic intellectual has made Sudan a focal point in the Muslim world.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm trying to propose an original model,&quot; he says, &quot;taking advantage of the Western model, taking advantage of other human values from the West, Islam, Christianity to try to develop my own model -- socially, politically and economically.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Southerners say no. The major stumbling block to Turabi's Islamic experiment has been the war in the south, where Christians and animists make up the majority of the population and have opposed Turabi's dream. As the horror of southern Sudan becomes known more widely, the Khartoum government is finding itself roundly criticized for preaching religion while allowing children to starve. From Turabi's perspective, that is not the fault of the Khartoum government but of those who have chosen to oppose it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are trying to build up the country now,&quot; Turabi said in recent interviews at his home and office in Khartoum. &quot;Since independence we have had many governments and unfortunately the latest government was very corrupt, so the country developed civil war in the south, tribal war in the west, complete poverty in the west, east and south.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi says he wants to see the current government bring Sudan's people together &quot;and not allow a Somalia-like situation.&quot; Already, reports coming out of southern Sudan have likened it to Somalia. But in Sudan, the fight is over religion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi insists that such comparisons are invalid and that the Khartoum government wants to establish a society based on democracy and moral principles. He prides himself on being a rational, well-educated man, well-steeped in Western thought and culture. He says he is open to dialogue with the West but not to Western domination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a dinner party in his home in a residential section of Khartoum, Turabi enters the harem, where his wife is entertaining, and lays a bunch of fresh dates on the table.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Where do you think these come from?&quot; he beams, with his characteristic throaty laugh. &quot;Please, try to guess.&quot; As it turns out, the dates were sent to him from Iraq. &quot;They were gifts to us from the people of Iraq for delivering them cattle.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi was behind the Sudanese government's shipment of cattle to Iraq in October as a humanitarian gesture. &quot;Of course you know the American government was opposed to us sending the cattle,&quot; he says, &quot;But the United Nations finally agreed to allow us to do it.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internationalism. Sudan was criticized in Western circles for not feeding its own starving people with the exported cattle. But in much of the Muslim world, Sudan was applauded for standing up to the United States on behalf of Iraq's suffering people. And Turabi, at least for now, appears most interested in strengthening his influence in his own region. He has organized the Popular Arabic and Islamic Conference, a group that he says includes representatives of both the Arab and Islamic worlds. &quot;It convenes not only Muslims, but Arabs, even Christians, and not only Islamic attitudes, but nationalist attitudes,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi is secretary-general of the organization, which he said was established after the Gulf War, when existing organizations proved too weak to prevent the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait or the war against Iraq. As the group stretches its feelers throughout Asia, Africa and Arabia, he is involved in testing new theories of Islamic governance in Sudan, melding what he considers the best of Western economic and business practices with his vision of the moral superiority of Islamic thought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It all begins with improving the standard of living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;People have to be relatively free economically to enjoy political freedom,&quot; he says. &quot;And I think the government is now liberating the country.  It is liberating the economy from the public to the private sector, removing laws on trade, removing most agriculture trade from the government to the private sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi dismisses reports of human rights abuses by the government, which has been accused of detaining opponents without charges. Turabi sees detentions as a temporary but necessary aberration to protect his embryonic Islamic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You know in case of war, you can not apply a fair, stable system of law,&quot; he argues. &quot;You can apply some emergency measures. So in this government, because it is unstable economically and politically, emergency law becomes necessary.&quot; To Turabi, this is no different from the actions of Western governments during times of war or crisis. &quot;When you conducted your civil war, were they fair in managing their enemies? Even during the last war, you took Americans of Japanese origin, took hundreds of thousands and put them in camps until the end of the war.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi concedes that Sudan's emergency laws are being used to justify the arrests of hundreds of people, from university professors to doctors. But he said such practices will end as soon as the government gains stability and the war in the south ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not everyone is convinced. Many people in Sudan are worried that their country is heading toward another dictatorial regime, imposed this time by religion. It was resistance to the imposition of Islamic law in the south that has fueled Sudan's civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi insists that the government has no intention of forcing Islamic law on non-Muslims. Even in the mostly Muslim north, the civil and family codes of Sharia law apply only to Muslims, he says. But the criminal code</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">applies to all: the punishment for drinking is beating; the penalty for serious crimes such as armed robbery is maiming; and murder brings a death penalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the south, Turabi says, non-Muslims would be free to develop their own system of laws, in keeping with their religious principles. &quot;Religion must be spread freely,&quot; he says. &quot;The Quran itself prohibits anyone from becoming Muslim through force.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi says Western diplomats have accused him of fomenting militant Islam in many parts of the world, from encouraging unrest in North Africa to training terrorists for operations in Egypt and Europe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Wherever I went in the West, I don't know whether they were told about me or whether they just branded me. They thought I was a dangerous subversive revolutionary. And that's why I think someone tried to kill me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was attacked physically last year in Canada, after a visit to the United States where he met with U.S. lawmakers and addressed several American Muslim organizations. He is convinced that the Sudanese exile who almost killed him did not act alone but was part of a Western conspiracy aimed at Islam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They say I am responsible for all the Islamic revolutions around the world, for the changes in government,&quot; he says. &quot;I told them it's not true.  This is a historical phenomenon. It just happens I speak English and can have dialogue with you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite such denials, Turabi is connected through his Popular Arabic and Islamic Conference to Islamists throughout the world. Sudan has developed close ties with Iran, though Turabi seems ambivalent about the kind of Islamic state that has evolved there. And he is unyielding in his attacks on Saudi Arabia, which he says offers only the facade of an Islamic state.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Like all religious communities, you have a traditional religious establishment, analogous to the church in Christian societies, and that is particularly so about Saudi Arabia and Iran, both Muslim communities where scholars, the mullahs, are very important, where they are very old book, very conservative -- where they never renew religious spirit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi says religious leaders in both countries should rethink their attitudes toward the role of women in society. He points to a recently passed Sudanese law setting aside ten percent of elected offices for women. &quot;Women are represented on a big scale in parliament,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Actually, only about 35 of the more than 300 lawmakers are women, but Turabi says their power and number are growing. A women's unit has been established in the Sudanese army, and women are competing equally with men in higher education and the professions, he says. &quot;But still there is work to be done. We have a legacy, a customary attitude to women that is very conservative, that would rather isolate women from the public scene and life.  What I look forward to is not only liberation of women in Muslim society, but perfecting the model itself. I want to reform society politically so that it is completely free, not just formally free. And I want a country that is not corrupt, that is morally and not just legally controlled.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turabi is convinced that reform is well underway in Sudan. He says he expects rapid progress in the standard of living as soon as peace is achieved. &quot;This year, the Sudan is going to export more than 1,000 tons of sorghum,&quot; he says. &quot;Most Sudanese are growing their own food in all parts of the country, except the south.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And Turabi says the government soon will begin exporting sugar, meat, seeds and oil. But he says the biggest success is in loosening the shackles of dependence on foreign aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Sudan is now a much more equal place than before and much freer than before,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muslims and non-Muslims alike are watching Turabi's experiment to see if the world's newest Islamic government will bring stability to Sudan and end the massive suffering in the south. For even Turabi concedes that his ideal Islamic state can only succeed if it achieves peace and nourishes the principles of democracy, equality for women and respect for basic human rights.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RIGHTS AND WRONGS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prospects for a new public television series have been boosted by the recruitment of Charlayne Hunter-Gault as host. The weekly program, called &quot;Rights and Wrongs,&quot; will focus on human rights issues around the world.  Hunter-Gault, who will remain national correspondent of the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; on PBS, says she sees the new show as a way to bring serious journalistic attention to little-known situations that affect the lives of hundreds of millions of people. At least 70 public television stations are expected to begin airing the show on April 9. The series, produced by the folks at Global Vision, who also produced &quot;South Africa Now,&quot; is funded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Body Shop Foundation and the Aaron Diamond Foundation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PAYING HIS DUES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World heavyweight boxing champion, Riddick Bowe, who has been visiting Africa, says that African Americans need to do more to aid the continent of their ancestry. On a visit to Somalia sponsored by the U.S. relief agency Americare, Bowe took food and medicine and said he is earmarking for Somalia the potential proceeds from a possible rematch with former boxing champion Evander Holyfield. Bowe, who also visited refugee camps in Kenya, was accompanied by his wife, Julie, who wept when she stepped onto African soil, saying that the experience was &quot;overwhelming.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAID TO REST</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The casket was draped in the African National Congress flag of green, black and gold. ANC leader Nelson Mandela gave a eulogy before thousands of mourners who included his estranged wife, Winnie Mandela, ANC President Oliver Tambo, legendary anti-apartheid campaigners Walter and Albertina Sisulu, and Chris Hani, head of the ANC's armed wing Umkhonto weSizwe (&quot;Spear of the Nation&quot;). The person they came to honor was not a prominent black activist from South Africa's convulsed townships, but a British-born white women, Helen Joseph.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mandela recalled Joseph as the first person banned by the South African government, as well as the woman who helped raise his daughters Zinzi and Zenani while he was jailed. She was, he said, &quot;my friend, my sister and comrade.&quot; In an energetic sermon at the overcrowded St. Mary's Anglican Church in downtown Johannesburg, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said, &quot;The fact that Helen was white and that most of us here to pay tribute to her are black shows that the struggle is for all of us together -- black and white in South Africa.&quot; Joseph, who was 87 when she died, is the first white person to be buried in Soweto's Avalon Cemetery, where she lies next to her longtime friend, Lillian Ngoyi, with whom she worked to organize the 1956 march of 20,000 African women to protest the requirement that they carry passbooks.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African newspaper publisher Pius Njawe has been awarded the Golden Pen press freedom prize by the International Federation of Newspaper Publishers, headquartered in Paris. The publisher of Le Messager is printing and distributing his pro-democracy newspaper clandestinely after receiving death threats against himself and his family. &quot;With courage, determination and ingenuity, Mr. Njawe has stood his ground and kept his newspaper coming out,&quot; the publishers' group said, noting that the government of President Paul Biya has used censorship, seizure of issues and arrests of staff to try to prevent the newspaper's distribution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cameroon government has stepped up a crackdown in recent months against critics who charge that elections held in October were fraudulent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE TOUGHEST JOB</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ghanaian diplomat Kofi Annan assumed the post of undersecretary- general for peacekeeping last week at the United Nations. It won't be an easy assignment. UN peacekeeping operations are overextended and underfunded and are running into difficulties from various warring factions to conflicts who aren't sure they want to transfer that fight to a negotiating table or ballot box. The world body currently is overseeing peacekeeping missions in Angola, Western Sahara, Somalia and Mozambique. Responsibility for two UN observer missions, in Eritrea and South Africa, falls to another UN department.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRAVELING SHOES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senegalese historian and linguist Pathe Diagne, who believes that Africans reached the Americas more than a century before Columbus, will set sail to prove the feasibility of his theory. The governments of Senegal and Nigeria are backing the trip, which -- like voyages by Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl -- aims less at establishing proof than at demonstrating that small boats piloted by skilled seafarers could have made the journey. &quot;Our aim is not to show who got there first,&quot; Diagne told the Associated Press, &quot;but to teach the world about West Africa's historical knowledge of navigation.&quot; Diagne, who plans to launch his four boats in May or June, bases his theory on old Spanish maps and archaeological evidence in Mexico.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HE'LL BE MISSED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Episcopal Archbishop George D. Browne of Liberia died last month at the age of 59 during a visit to Milwaukee. His archdiocese, which he was elected to head in 1982, covered six West African countries. In 1970, the cleric was the first African to become Bishop of Liberia, a country founded by freed American slaves in 1847. He was known and admired by Liberians and other West Africans for his personal courage, both in the last years of a tottering dictatorship and during the civil way that has wracked Liberia since 1989. Ignoring death threats, he served on a commission that proposed democratic reforms, and during the worst of the fighting he opened churches in Monrovia, the capital, to shelter refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SKELETONS IN THE CLOSET</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week in Paris, a mercenary's luck ran out. Bob Denard, who was a model for the main character in such books and films as &quot;The Dogs of War,&quot; was arrested on his arrival from South Africa. He is charged with complicity in the 1989 murder of President Ahmed Abdallah of the Comoros Islands, an archipelago nation off Africa's southeast coast. Denard, who said he was ready to leave behind a life of subterfuge, is reported by the French press to have told aides that he will testify that the French secret service encouraged and aided his actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MUSICAL TRIBUTE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Song of Jacob Zulu,&quot; a play premiered by Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater Company last year, is coming to Broadway after a run in Perth, Australia. Although not a conventional musical where the main characters break into song, the play by Tug Yergra depends heavily on the performance of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the South African singers who gained U.S. attention when Paul Simon included them for his Grammy- winning &quot;Graceland&quot; release in 1986. The group won its own Grammy the next year. Audiences attending &quot;Jacob Zulu&quot; have been enthusiastic about the seamless interweaving of spoken word and music to tell a powerful story -- &quot;like a Greek tragedy with a chorus,&quot; said one theatergoer. Lead Ladysmith vocalist Joseph Shabalala says he does the play as a loving memorial to all those South Africans who fought apartheid but didn't live to see it fall.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The play previews in New York on March 17 at the Plymouth Theatre on 47th and Broadway (212-239-6200). A grand opening is scheduled for March 24.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the African National Congress (ANC) and the South African government move closer to agreement on power sharing, both sides are scrambling to shore up political support. The outlines of the agreement are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">now clear: a multiparty government will rule the country for five years following an election that is likely to take place in about 12 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC must sell the deal to its constituency, including militant youth and others still distrustful of the ruling National Party headed by President F.W. de Klerk.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government faces pressures not only from right-wing whites but also from groups of blacks. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, for example, and his Inkatha Freedom Party have rejected the ANC/government arrangement, insisting instead on a federal system with guaranteed autonomy for each of four regions. A federation would maximize Buthelezi's influence, since most of his political support is concentrated in the Indian Ocean province of Natal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the plan accepted by the ANC and the government, Nelson Mandela and the ANC are expected to gain enough votes to lead a government in which de Klerk and his party would hold several important posts, and other, smaller groups would hold a few Cabinet seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alongside the political discussions, ANC and government negotiators have been crafting a deal to merge the ANC's guerrilla wing, Umkhonto weSizwe (&quot;Spear of the Nation&quot;) into the national army. Since power sharing talks began, following Mandela's release from prison in 1989, the ANC has suspended guerrilla activity but has maintained its military wing and some of its training bases outside the country. The merger agreement would require dissolution of Umkhonto, a move some guerrillas are resisting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month several ANC members were arrested and charged with smuggling arms into the country. Mandela called the actions a violation of ANC policy, but some of his colleagues reject the idea of giving up their weapons until a new government is installed. The ANC now must convince skeptics in its ranks that the power sharing deal is the fastest and surest route to majority rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part, the government has been reaching out to potential new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">backers, including two sizable minorities: Asians and Coloureds (people of racially mixed ancestry). Last month, de Klerk named two Coloureds and one Indian to relatively minor posts in his Cabinet.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">South Africa's mixed-race Coloured community, arguably the most cruelly humiliated of all apartheid's victims, is about to commit an astonishing act of contrariness by voting in droves for its persecutors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent opinion polls indicate that up to 53 percent of the 3 million Coloured people support the ruling National Party, the creators of apartheid, while between three and 4.8 percent support the African National Congress (ANC). Support for President F.W. de Klerk as a leader is even more overwhelming, with a massive 74 percent favoring him against only five percent for Nelson Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given what has been done to the Coloured people over the past 45 years -- from the forced removal of 60,000 of them from their historic home settlement in Cape Town's District Six, to race classification officials running pencils through their hair to test its crinkliness, to a law prohibiting interracial sex, which implied that their very existence was a crime -- the response seems almost as irrational as Jews lining up to support a neo-Nazi party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, as de Klerk and his Ministers hasten to point out, the National Party has reformed. It has abandoned apartheid. It has welcomed into its ranks 45 Coloured and 27 Indian members of parliament, who have crossed the floor of their respective Houses to make de Klerk's party the most multiracial in South Africa's clumsy tricameral parliament.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the party has not renounced its past. Only the other day de Klerk sprang to the defense of the chief architects of apartheid -- predecessors Daniel Malan, Hans Strijdom and Hendrik Verwoerd -- describing them as &quot;men of great personal integrity&quot; who were &quot;sincere in their belief that separate development could bring justice to black South Africans.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There appear to be three main reasons why the Coloureds are supporting their old oppressors -- fear of communism, fear of the black African majority, and a failure of leadership by the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Religious factors sway many. &quot;It is not so much the socialist element of communism as the atheist factor,&quot; says Vernon Rose, an American- educated Coloured pastor who heads a regional development agency. South Africa's Coloureds are a deeply religious people; nearly all are members of the Calvinist Dutch Reformed Church, and the ANC's alliance with the South African Communist Party disturbs them mightily.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aware of this, Mandela used his personal influence to have the Reverend Allan Boesak, the charismatic Coloured preacher who with Archbishop Desmond Tutu spearheaded the great anti-apartheid revolt of the 1980s, elected chairman of the ANC branch in the Western Cape Province, where most of the Coloured people live. But Boesak's image has been tarnished by his involvement in an extramarital affair. He has seemed not to have his heart in the job, and his two senior lieutenants, Vice Chairman Lerumo Kalako and Secretary Tony Yengeni, are both prominent members of the Communist Party.  Many Coloureds see the dispirited Boesak as a captive of those subordinates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What some observers here call the &quot;God factor&quot; also gives de Klerk his biggest advantage over Mandela. A devout Christian and regular church- goer, de Klerk proclaims his faith in almost every speech he makes, which is something Mandela never does. &quot;If only Mandela would use the word 'God' occasionally,&quot; lamented a senior ANC member who is himself a Muslim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mandela won't. He has stated publicly that while he is not an atheist, he regards religious belief as a private matter and abhors the flaunting of it in political speeches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Race rears its head. Racism is a more delicate issue that few want to discuss openly. &quot;Please don't use my name,&quot; said a white ANC supporter, &quot;but I think there is a deep-seated racism in the Coloured community. Many Coloureds have got an inborn desire to be white, and they look down on blacks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rose puts it more obliquely. &quot;The Coloureds' perception of black</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">people is exactly what the apartheid policy wanted it to be: that black is inferior,&quot; he says. Random conversations in the Coloured townships outside Cape Town quickly reveal that the derogatory term &quot;kaffir,&quot; the South African equivalent of &quot;nigger,&quot; is in far greater usage there than in the white community, where it is now taboo in all but far rightist circles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several Coloureds I spoke to used it freely and made little attempt to hide their contempt for blacks. People who know the community well say lightness of skin has long been a status symbol among Coloureds, and darkness a stigma. &quot;We used to have jobs advertised here in Cape Town for people who were 'slightly Coloured,'&quot; says Allan Hendrickse, leader of the Coloured Labour Party, which hopes to form an alliance with the ANC but is also losing support to the National Party. Allen Boesak tells how community leaders came to his light-skinned mother when he was small and told her that if she gave her dark-skinned children away they could get her reclassified as white.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taking too much for granted. Compounding these problems is what Franklin Sonn, a leading Coloured educator and ANC supporter, describes as a failure of the ANC leadership to understand the nature of the Coloured community, its special fears and needs, and to devise a strategy to win its support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What is happening here is more a failure on the ANC's part than a success by the National Party,&quot; says Sonn. &quot;The young African leaders live in separate townships. They don't come face to face with the Coloured community but just take it for granted that the steam of the liberation struggle will bring them along.&quot; Rose agrees with that critique. &quot;The ANC must become more community friendly,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prominent community leaders like these are distressed by this failure.  &quot;It is enough to make you cry,&quot; says Sonn. The thought of the Coloured people voting for the National Party is so painful to me that I can't contemplate it. It's like voting for the slave-owner.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some think it is not too late to turn the situation around. Jannie Momberg and Jan van Eck, two white Afrikaner ministers of parliament who joined the ANC last year and spend a lot of time campaigning in the Coloured townships where the dominant language is Afrikaans, are among them. &quot;I think there is a latent base of support that the ANC will be able to tap when it comes to the election,&quot; says Momberg. Van Eck contends that rural and working-class Coloureds are slower to join the National Party than the growing middle class, which now sees a chance at last to join the white community. Middle-class Coloureds, like the whites, feel threatened by the African majority, while many working-class Coloureds belong to trade unions, which are allied to the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Also, life in the cities has changed,&quot; says Van Eck, &quot;but out on the farms and in the country towns it hasn't. There the Coloured workers are still being badly treated by Afrikaner farmers, and the ANC is drawing crowds of up to 2,500 to its meetings.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This presents more ironies. Historically, the Coloureds of Cape Town have been the radicals and the country folk the conservatives. Now that may be reversing. Even more ironic is that if the Coloured community, who constitute 60 percent of the population of the Western Cape Province, do indeed swing to de Klerk in the numbers the polls suggest, this region, which is historically the most liberal in the country, may be the only one the National Party wins in South Africa's first one-person, one-vote election.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Africa's spreading democracy movements started gathering steam in 1990, over half the continent's 54 countries have begun the transition from autocratic political systems to multiparty governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Late last month, President Didier Ratsiraka of Madagascar became the fifth African leader in just over three years to go down to defeat at the polls. Five other heads of state have been forced from office by popular uprisings or coups, and several more strongmen have been compelled to adopt significant political reforms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dramatic changes have prompted a palpable sense of euphoria in many parts of the vast region, which is more than three times the size of the United States. In some countries, the reforms have been more cosmetic than real, and everywhere the challenge of creating governments that are truly accountable to their people is daunting. But the pressure for a new political order continues.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Madagascar, the Indian Ocean island nation off Africa's southeastern coast, the winner by a margin of two-to-one was Albert Zafy. A 65-year-old medical professor, Zafy emerged as the leader of a broad-based democracy campaign in 1991 that drew as many as half a million people to near-daily protests and forced Ratsiraka, who has been in office since 1975, to abandon one-party rule and agree to a competitive vote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A transitional government that included both government and opposition members organized the presidential balloting. In the first round last November, Zafy emerged from a field of eight candidates with 45 percent of the votes. A new parliament, which will name the prime minister and key government officials, is to be elected in April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the West African nation of Senegal, the outcome of elections, while different, was not unexpected. Abdou Diouf, who has been president since 1981, won another term in voting on February 21. Preliminary results showed him defeating his long-time rival, Abdoulaye Wade, and six other candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Senegal, whose first president was the internationally known poet Leopold Senghor, is one of the few African countries that has held regular multiparty elections throughout its post-independence history. Diouf's assumption of the presidency when Senghor retired is cited as a model of peaceful transition on an often turbulent continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like Senghor, Diouf has made a name for himself beyond Senegal. He currently chairs both the Organization of African Unity and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a worldwide grouping of Islamic nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the Senegalese leader has been criticized for failing to resolve economic woes and internal divisions at home. The former French colony is deep in debt and heavily dependent on outside aid, due in part to plummeting world commodity prices since the mid-1980s. Last year alone, the country's leading export product, peanut oil, dropped in price by nearly 35 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most serious political crisis is a serious separatist rebellion in the southern region of Casamance. During the recent election, several dozen people were reported killed in attacks attributed to a Casamance rebel group, and thousands have been forced by the violence to flee their homes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diouf's margin in the last presidential vote, in 1988, was widely disputed, and protests over the results prompted the government to impose a state of emergency and arrest leading opposition figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This year's election has been criticized as well. Observers from the United States and France said the polling was generally fair, although hampered by shortages of voting equipment and personnel. But the seven opposition parties charge Diouf's party with widespread electoral fraud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new test for Diouf and his ruling Socialist Party lies just ahead.  Parliamentary elections later this month will provide Wade's Democratic Party and several of the smaller opposition movements the opportunity to garner enough representation to pose a significant challenge to government policies in legislative deliberations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First elected president for Niger. Another African nation in the process of choosing a new leader is Niger, where the final round of presidential voting is scheduled to take place on March 20. Eight candidates were on the ballot for round one on February 27.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Niger has spent most of its post-independence history as a one-party state with an authoritarian military leader at the helm. No previous president has been chosen in a contested vote. Widespread popular protests in 1991 forced the military leadership to yield to an interim administration that has been guiding the country toward the ballot box. Ali Sa bou, a military officer who has been head-of-state since 1987, is barred from running but remains in office as figurehead leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In last month's vote, a coalition of nine political parties -- the Alliance of Forces for Change -- won a combined majority in the one- chamber national assembly. However, the largest bloc of seats for a single party went to the former ruling party, the National Movement for a Developing Society, which won 28 out of a total of 83 places in the assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obstacles Along Election Road. None of the countries making the transition to multiparty government are finding the changeover to be uncomplicated, and some have encountered major pitfalls. Electoral plans have been delayed in a number of countries, including Angola, where civil war has resumed, Mozambique, where a United Nations observer team has been slow in arriving, and Togo, where an entrenched military regime has blocked democratic reforms from being implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation, is currently in the process of beginning its presidential election process again, after an embarrassing false start in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, the country took the first of a series of steps to nominate new presidential candidates. President Ibrahim Babangida, the military leader who has pledged to hand power to an elected civilian regime later this year, nullified last September's presidential primaries, saying the process was characterized by large-scale fraud, including vote buying.  The two legally recognized political parties have been directed to choose their presidential nominees through a process that begins with wards and moves up through local and state organizations to the national level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At state party congresses this week, one candidate from each of the country's 30 states and the federal capital territory, Abuja, will be chosen to stand for the nomination of the Social Democratic Party and the National Republican Convention, as the two parties are called. The presidential election is now scheduled to take place on June 11.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another country that canceled a 1992 vote is the Central African Republic. With the assent of the opposition, Gen. Andre Kolingba, the head of state, &quot;disallowed&quot; the results of last October's elections because of widely reported irregularities. After a delay, new presidential and parliamentary balloting is set for April 18 and May 2.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congo, too, will be holding new parliamentary elections soon, although a parliament and president were chosen last July and August. In November, President Pascal Lissouba dissolved the assembly after the prime minister lost a no-confidence vote. The ensuing political crisis, which brought the country to the brink of political instability and raised the specter of a return to military rule, was eased by the formation of a coalition government. But deep divisions remain, and final agreement on a new election is still to be announced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political contests unresolved. Two African rulers who won hotly contested votes late last year have had their victories challenged by distrustful opponents. Ghana's Jerry Rawlings and Kenya's Daniel arap Moi have been accused of using their positions as incumbents to manipulate the voting in their favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition parties in Ghana boycotted legislative elections in December to protest the outcome of the November 3 presidential balloting.  Rawlings, a former air force flight lieutenant, who won with 58 percent of the votes, has led Ghana since staging a widely popular military coup that ousted a corrupt civilian administration in 1981.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If unresolved, the election dispute could jeopardize the country's continued access to sizable assistance from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and from a number of Western countries. Efforts to encourage a workable compromise between Rawlings and his leading opponents have begun, involving, among others, the Carter Center in Atlanta. An election observer team from the center was among those international monitors who found the November poll to be generally fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kenya, Moi's win was a bitter pill for political reformers. After forcing the president to back away from an insistence on continued one- party rule, his opponents failed to unify to defeat him at the polls. With the opposition splintered, Moi was able to cling to office by winning 36 percent of the votes. Opposition parties won 88 out of 188 elected parliamentary seats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers from Commonwealth countries concluded that the elections &quot;cannot be given an unqualified rating as free and fair,&quot; but they also called the voting &quot;an important turning point in Kenya's history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the election, Moi has been criticized for failing to take any conciliatory steps to heal the political divisions. Using his constitutional prerogative to appoint 12 members of parliament, he named 11 senior members of his ruling Kanu Party who had been defeated at the polls. And on the day after parliament, convened last month with its first opposition membership in over 25 years, Moi used another constitutional provision to suspend the proceedings and send legislators home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The political situation is further clouded by court challenges to election results in 90 parliamentary districts, according to the Nairobi-based news-magazine Weekly Review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the problems, the government has declared the elections a success and has begun campaigning to have international aid suspended in late 1991 restored.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An even more serious stand-off between a besieged ruler and his opponents resulted from last October's election in Cameroon. The incumbent president, Paul Biya, claimed victory with a reported 40 percent of the vote, compared to 36 percent for John Fru Ndi, his chief rival. Biya, who quickly organized elections after being forced into political concessions by popular pressure, won financial backing from France after the vote and was sworn in for a new five-year term. Fru Ndi, however, continues to dispute the results and to call for an election monitored by outside observers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Learning the ropes. In many other countries, preparations for upcoming votes are actively underway. The East African nation of Burundi has scheduled parliamentary and presidential elections for June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National elections are set to take place at about the same time in Lesotho, the tiny mountain kingdom surrounded by South Africa. The country's last election was aborted by then-president Leabua Jonathan 23 years ago with backing from South Africa after it became clear the opposition would win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In neighboring Malawi, voters will have the chance to decide on whether to end one-party rule in a referendum scheduled for June 14. The country's &quot;president for life,&quot; Hastings Kamuzu Banda, who has ruled with an iron grip since independence in 1964, agreed to a referendum on the issue after popular protests last year and a cut-off in international aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the government has rejected secret balloting, Banda has agreed to international observers and to the inclusion of opposition politicians on the commission that will oversee the vote. Meanwhile, Malawi authorities retain a tight reign on political opponents. In a continuation of the regime's traditional hard-line approach to dissent, police arrested two exiled politicians on their arrival in the country last month to participate in the referendum. And the country's leading opposition figure, Chakufwa Chihana, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for sedition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Voters in Eritrea will cast ballots in April to decide on independence for the former Italian colony, annexed by Ethiopia in 1962. Across the continent, a referendum on independence for Western Sahara, which was occupied by Morocco in 1975, has been delayed by disagreement over the voters roll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most active voter preparation effort anywhere in Africa -- and the one attracting the greatest outside funding -- may be in South Africa. No date has been set, but the country is likely to hold its first one-person, one- vote poll sometime in early 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africans don't have to look far for an example of successful elections. Neighboring Namibia, which until 1990 was controlled by South Africa, held its first national vote in late 1989 under United Nations supervision. Swapo, the independence movement that fought South African rule, chalked up a 57 percent majority, giving it control of the government, although a large and lively opposition has acted as a watchdog.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In regional and local elections three months ago, however, Swapo won a landslide. The party was victorious in ten out of 13 regional constituencies and in most of the 50 local councils. The rout of the official opposition was complete enough to threaten its future political viability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;How can we maintain a healthy multiparty system if our party's platform wins such wide public acceptance that we trounce the opposition at the polls?&quot; asked one bemused government official following release of the December results.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That anomaly poses a dilemma for news organizations seeking to make a neutral presentation of facts. Although many reports still refer to Mobutu as Zaire's president, the Washington Post, in a recent article did not.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unrest over recent days in the Zairean capital, Kinshasa, during which soldiers surrounded the residence of Roman Catholic Archbishop Monsengwo Pasinya, prompted a senior American official in Washington to convey the Clinton admin-istration's concern for the cleric's safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herman Cohen, the assistant secretary of State for Africa in the Bush administration, who has remained at his post pending confirmation of his successor, gave what U.S. officials describe as an unequivocal message in a phone call to France. The archbishop, who chairs the interim pro-democracy parliament that is trying to end three decades of dictatorship in the country, must not be harmed, Cohen told Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's entrenched ruler, who was reached at one of his mansions on the French Riviera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since seizing power in a 1965 coup, Mobutu has enjoyed high-level access to American officials and close ties to the United States government.  Throughout the period, Zaire has been a leading recipient of U.S. aid and, in turn, has been a diplomatic ally and a strategic staging area for CIA operations in neighboring Angola and other parts of Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mobutu's well-documented excesses and dogged resistance to persistent domestic pressure for change is prodding Zaire's major backers into promoting reform, although critics believe they could do more. The United States, Belgium and France, both publicly and through diplomatic channels, have insisted that Mobutu yield all effective authority to the interim parliament the archbishop heads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been little tangible pressure backing up the government statements. But last month Belgium announced restrictions on visas for members of Mobutu's family and some of his closest aides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Visa restrictions already are being applied by the other two Benelux nations, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and are under consideration by</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">five other members of an eight-nation visa pact: France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Belgian authorities raided the Brussels home of one of Mobutu's closest associates, Bemba Salona, a wealthy Zaire entrepreneur.  According to press accounts in Europe and Zaire, police found $650,000 in cash and paper that they suspect could be used to make counterfeit bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgium, France and the United States are exploring other avenues of pressure on Mobutu that might extend to a freeze of his sizable investments overseas. His holdings have been estimated to total $5 billion or more. He is believed to own luxury apartments and villas in Belgium and France, additional estates in Portugal, Spain, Italy and several African countries, as well as extensive ranch land in Brazil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the U.S. Congress, has asked the Clinton administration for a &quot;much tougher stance&quot; against Mobutu. Hamilton advocates the freezing of bank accounts, denial of visas to Mobutu's associates, suspension of Zaire from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and an embargo on both arms sales to Zaire and imports of Zairean copper and cobalt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A letter to President Clinton from three dozen House members</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suggests a further step if other actions fail: U.S. logistical support for a United Nations peacekeeping intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Journalist Steve Askin, co-author of a forthcoming book on Zaire and Mobutu's finances, says that the form pressures take will determine their effectiveness. &quot;Freezing Mobutu's assets could freeze him in place,&quot; Askin says. Mobutu is unlikely to give up power and flee Zaire voluntarily -- as his critics would like -- if he does not believe he can continue to live in opulent style, Askin says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes a double-track approach would have the greatest impact: legal proceedings in various countries to seize key assets, along with a promise of limited legal immunity in exchange for permanent exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key to Mobutu authority is the income generated from sales of Zaire's smuggled diamonds. Although little diamond revenue ends up in state coffers, an estimated $25 million a month moves through &quot;irregular&quot; channels to fund Mobutu and his entourage, Askin says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, the government is spending more than ten times as much as it is taking in, confidential IMF statistics indicate. Total foreign debt has risen to about $11 billion, amounting to $300 for every person in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Copper and cobalt production, once the engine driving the economy, has plummeted. Copper exports, which averaged 500,000 tons in the mid 1980s, may fall below 150,000 tons this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire has fallen into such serious arrears with the IMF that it faces the immediate loss of membership rights, a drastic status for a country in an era when IMF acceptability is the key to attracting other finance and investment, both public and private.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last November, the IMF declared Zaire &quot;non-cooperating&quot; and gave the government three months to adopt serious reform measures. When the deadline passed on February 14, the IMF board used a technicality to postpone action.  The regulations governing such severe action against a member country have not been completed, IMF officials said. Zaire's situation will be reviewed when the regulations are ready or within four months -- whichever comes first, Fund officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton administration has completed a National Security Council study of policy options for Zaire, and a presidential order implementing most of the options under discussion could be prepared quickly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Washington wants to act in concert with Brussels and Paris, and those governments face more serious legal obstacles, diplomats say. In addition, France has indicated a reluctance to take some of the proposed steps, such as IMF expulsion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The French have a lot of turf in Africa,&quot; says an American official, referring to the former French colonies where Paris retains extensive influence. &quot;They are leery about setting a precedent that they might be pressured to follow somewhere else.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political deadlock in Zaire, traditionally one of the United States' closest allies in Africa, has already wrecked the economy and hiked tensions here to a permanent state of alert. Now the standoff is worsening, due to deepening distrust among the principal political actors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recent actions by troops loyal to Mobutu Sese Seko, the country's authoritarian ruler, have convinced opposition leaders that their personal safety is threatened. This &quot;new element&quot; has &quot;undermined the confidence of those who are trying to find a solution,&quot; says Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, chairman of the interim parliament, chosen last year by a national democracy conference, whose authority is resisted by Mobutu.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interviewed last week in his heavily guarded residence in the center of the capital, Monsengwo demanded that Mobutu explain why soldiers invaded the meeting hall where the interim assembly was meeting late last month, holding members hostage for three days without food, water or medical care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Monsengwo, who was presiding over the deliberations when the soldiers arrived, was quickly hidden by his armed bodyguards and spirited out a back door and over a fence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The archbishop and the parliament, known as the High Council of the Republic, have been seeking a compromise between Mobutu and interim Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, whom Mobutu tried to dismiss from his post last month. The High Council rejected Mobutu's action, saying sole authority over the post rests with the council itself. Tshisekedi says he will not accept Mobutu's attempt to fire him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu, who has ruled the country since seizing power in a 1965 coup, has relied on control of the army and the treasury to reward allies and manipulate the political and economic system in his favor. Without access to the national funds, Tshisekedi's government has been stymied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We must have fiscal authority,&quot; Tshisekedi said in an interview.  &quot;Mobutu wants to keep the financial system as before, but it is the High Council now that must decide expenditures.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council has appealed to Mobutu to &quot;scrupulously&quot; respect the transitional arrangements drawn up by a national democracy conference last year. Instead, the 62-year-old leader has continued to assert his own supremacy. He is expected to make another effort to oust Tshisekedi by naming as prime minister a prominent figure like Cleophas Kamitatu Masamba.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up to now, Tshisekedi has won the contest for public backing. His appeal for a boycott of large-denomination currency bills that Mobutu ordered minted has been widely adopted. Soldiers paid in the new 5-million- zaire notes in late January were unable to use them in the markets or stores.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When soldiers rioted and looted, Mobutu's crack guard unit, the 10,000-strong special presidential division, or DSP, opened fire to quell the mutiny, killings hundreds of troops.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The houses of opposition figures were also targeted for attack by the Israeli-trained DSP. Troops are said to have gone in search of Tshisekedi, who was hiding. An assault on the home of Frederick Kibassa Maliba, a veteran anti-Mobutu campaigner, left one of his sons dead and left two other children injured, although Kibassa himself escaped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The soldiers who held High Council members prisoner in late February did not resort to violence. Instead, they said they were acting to dramatize the need to be paid in money they can spend. But the protest failed to resolve the issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council was released, probably on orders from Mobutu, who was in France for what was announced as dental treatment. The Zaire ruler received strong diplomatic pressure from the French, Belgian and U.S. governments to intercede in the crisis. Immediately after the soldiers withdrew, the military chief of staff, Gen. Eluki Monga, announced that unless the currency issue was settled promptly, the army would take &quot;appropriate&quot; measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The council has invited Mobutu to come to Kinshasa to discuss the stalemate. Although he was reported to be holding talks last week with top aides at his mansion at Nsele, 30 miles (48 kilometers) outside the capital, he spends most of his time at his palatial residence in Gbadolite, near his birthplace in northern Zaire.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ROUGH SLEDDING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1991, Zambia was heralded as a promising democracy when Kenneth Kaunda's 27-year reign was ended at the ballot box. But his successor, President Frederick Chiluba, has found the challenges of democratic governance daunting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this month, Chiluba declared a 90-day state of emergency, charging that members of the main opposition group, Kaunda's United National Independence Party (Unip) were organizing a coup. The government also severed diplomatic ties with Iran and Iraq, accusing them of funding the plot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But opposition members are denouncing the move against Unip as an effort to bolster Chiluba's Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD), and Kaunda says there was no plot. More than 20 Unip members have been detained at least briefly since the emergency order went into effect, including three of Kaunda's sons.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the government, the coup was planned by a radical faction of Unip, which has been at odds with other party members over policy. These tensions and the government crackdown have raised the prospect that Unip might collapse, making Zambia effectively a one-party state again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DIOUF AGAIN</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process wasn't flawless, but last month's presidential election in Senegal produced a winner -- the incumbent, Abdou Diouf. Official results show Diouf winning a third term, receiving 58 percent of the vote, compared to 32 percent for his chief rival, Abdoulaye Wade. Opposition parties have denounced the vote, charging widespread cheating by the ruling party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many observers had expected that the tally would be close enough to require a second round of balloting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 38-member multinational observer team, organized by the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs in Washington, DC, called the election &quot;a positive step in the conciliation of Senegal's multiparty political system.&quot; In a preliminary report, the NDI delegation also listed a number of shortcomings and irregularities. Among them, it said, were difficulties with voting cards and the ineffective use of indelible ink, which was supposed to prevent the casting of duplicate ballots. &quot;While these problems were cause for concern, the delegation received no evidence they materially affected the election,&quot; the report concludes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COMIC RELIEF</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government of Malawi has come up with an innovative method of addressing the problem of teenage pregnancy. A comic book, entitled Sugar Daddy, is being distributed to schools throughout the southern African nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The comic depicts the story of Chiphetsa, a young girl who becomes involved with an older man, attracted by the promise of financial and emotional security. Like thousands of other Malawian teens, she becomes pregnant and is expelled from school.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's high birth rate contributes not only to poverty but also to serious health problems for women, government officials report.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CORPS RETREAT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Peace Corps has halted operations in Equatorial Guinea following a series of security incidents apparently aimed at foreigners. The program's last nine volunteers and three staff members were evacuated to Yaounde, Cameroon, on February 24 by charter airplane, after several volunteers were subjected to harassment by people associated with the government,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We've spent a very, very tense time,&quot; said Sabina Dunton, the Peace Corps director for Equatorial Guinea, on her arrival in Yaounde.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Peace Corps withdrawal follows a decision by the State Department early this month to recall U.S. Ambassador John Bennett to Washington. In February, Bennett received a death threat, which U.S. officials believe was instigated by the government of President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. Also last month, a French development official who worked in the Ministry of Finance was found dead in his bed with his throat slit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other less serious incidents -- including the theft of Spanish Embassy diplomatic pouches from the airport and the holding of a Spanish diplomat at gunpoint -- also have been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomats in Yaounde say the harassment of foreigners may be a reaction to recent pressure from Western nations, especially the U.S. and Spain, to introduce democratic reforms in a country dominated by dictatorships since its independence in 1968.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the past year, the Obiang government has allowed the formation of ten opposition political parties, but government opponents still face harassment. &quot;The government doesn't like dissenters and it doesn't like dissent,&quot; says a foreign aid worker who recently left Malabo, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The death threat against Bennett &quot;raised a lot of alarm bells,&quot; one diplomatic source says. A statement issued by the State Department announcing the ambassador's recall warned the government &quot;that it will be held responsible for the safety of all Americans in the country.&quot; &quot;The ambassador's recall was only temporary and was meant to signal high- level concern,&quot; one official says. Bennett is expected to return to Malabo before the end of March. (by Derald Everhart</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO THE DEATH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an effort to develop a transition plan for the country's derailed democracy process, talks began in mid-March between Algerian government officials and opposition leaders. However, the largest opposition group, the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) is not included.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since a state of emergency was declared in Algeria in early 1992, the country has been ruled by a council of state with support from the military.  The crackdown came in the midst of a national election campaign which the fundamentalist FIS seemed certain to win. Over 600 Islamic fundamentalists reportedly have been killed by government special forces during the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some opposition leaders taking part in the latest discussions have expressed skepticism that negotiations can succeed without representation from moderate elements within the FIS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OUT OF GAS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A distress call from a ship off Africa's east coast early this month has led the ship's crew into troubled waters. Coast guard personnel from the island nation of Seychelles went to the aid of the Greek-flagged ship, Maria, which broadcast signals for help after running out of fuel. Once onboard, Seychelles officials discovered a sizable cargo of arms and ammunition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ship had aroused suspicion already because the crew apparently renamed the vessel more than once while at sea. Now the U.S. State Department in Washington says the shipment contains Serbian arms that were destined for Somalia. If true, the venture would violate two United Nations embargoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ship's crew has been detained pending further investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> VINTAGE MOBUTU</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire's Mobutu Sese Seko is up to the old tricks that have kept him in power for 28 years. Last week, he engineered the selection of a new political figure to serve as the country's prime minister. But his choice has been rejected by the interim parliament and by Zaire's major international backers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month, Mobutu tried to fire Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, who was chosen for the post last year by a national democracy conference representing Zaire's political, religious and civic organizations. However, the dismissal was vetoed by the High Council of the Republic, the interim parliament elected by the national conference to steer the country toward democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to bypass the High Council, Mobutu convened his own conclave of hand-picked political figures in mid-March to come up with a new candidate for prime minister. The sessions were boycotted by both Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo Pasinya, chairman of the interim parliament, and the opposition coalition, known as the Sacred Union. But the meeting continued for nearly two weeks, ending with the selection of Faustin Birindwa, who was one of four co-presidents of Tshisekedi's party before resigning this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu also has stymied the democratic process by refusing to yield control over the country's finances and military to the interim government.  But the political stalemate and deteriorating economy have prompted reaction from the countries Mobutu has previously relied upon for principal support -- the United States, Belgium and France. The three governments have been considering measures to pressure Mobutu to give up his authority, and they have said they will do business only with a prime minister chosen by the High Council.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In what may be a sign of a toughening stance, Mobutu was refused his request for a visa to enter France this week to stay in one of his luxurious estates on the French Riviera. And Clinton administration officials say Ambassador to Zaire Melissa Wells, who is moving to a senior UN position, will not be replaced in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum for African Art opened its doors last month in the area of lower Manhattan known as SoHo. An outgrowth of the eight-year- old Center for African Art on New York's upper east side, the new</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">museum preserves the center's founding inspiration: &quot;the belief that African art, an eloquent testimony to the richness of black culture, is one of humankind's highest achievements.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its SoHo quarters, the museum shares a block with the New Museum of Contemporary Art and the Guggenheim Museum SoHo to create a &quot;museum row&quot; designed to attract a diversity of art lovers. The African museum's space is triple the size of the former Center for African Art and was the object of much exploratory planning. Last May, Museum Director Susan Vogel convened a symposium of African and American experts to discuss how to design an African art museum to meet 21st century needs. The renovation of the SoHo building reflects those conversations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maya Lin, the 34-year-old artist whose earlier work includes the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in Washington and the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, was selected to design the museum. &quot;I think of the space as lyrical and spiritual,&quot; she says, &quot;full of mystery and shadows -- a place that is dark, safe, welcoming and protective.&quot; In a museum, she says, the journey through the physical space should be integral to the experience. &quot;On this journey, the descent and ascent are central, so I have spent a lot of time on the staircases that connect the street and lower levels, where the two main galleries are located. One staircase is narrow in the descent and wide, asymmetrical and spiraling in the ascent. You move into the darkness and emerge into the light.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To inject what she calls &quot;invisible dynamics&quot; and &quot;musical rhythms&quot; into the space, Lin has used textural details such as green glass, copper screens, pinpoints of light and indigo fabric.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the collections and special exhibits displayed by the museum, the nonprofit institution will operate several special projects, including an education program for New York City schools; regular presentations of film, video, music, dance and performance art; Saturday afternoon family workshops; and study tours for travelers interested in African art, history and culture. This year the museum is sponsoring six tours to east, west and southern Africa. Limited to 12 participants each, the trips are designed to allow intensive interaction with local people and traditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A portion of the museum's expanded space is devoted to a shop featuring African crafts, including clothes and jewelry. Director Vogel says the store's wares provide a link with living African craftspeople. &quot;We are not selling any reproductions,&quot; she says. &quot;Everything here is made in Africa so purchases help support craftspeople and keep their ancient arts alive.&quot; *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Museum for African Art is located at 593 Broadway. It is open Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m., Tuesdays are reserved for school groups by appointment. Suggested admission is $3.00 for adults and $1.50 for seniors, students and children. For more information call (212) 966-1313.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Why do African art and culture matter to Americans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Traditional African art is one of the great artistic traditions -- one of humankind's highest achievements. African art and culture matter to us, here and now, because a very big part of our population is African in origin, a piece of American culture is African in origin. The African ingredients in our culture make us distinctive as Americans, so they should be of interest to everyone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What does African art offer to us now at the end of the 20th century?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: African art is a rich source of ideas. The painter Maillol said, &quot;African art embodies more ideas than French art,&quot; speaking, I think, about the inventive forms that were so important to artists early in the century. Today the forms of African art have become familiar, giving it virtually the status of old master works. But the spiritual ideas it expresses, the complex insights it can offer into the human condition, the solutions that African civilizations have invented to problems that still vex us -- problems of the environment, of healing, of social and spiritual strength and cohesion -- these African ideas now attract and surprise with the power that African sculptural forms did before.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fifty years ago, the West was more certain about its religious beliefs and political and economic systems. Now doubt pervades all these areas and has left openings, even a hunger, to look elsewhere. On a spiritual level there's a renewed interest in African religion, and there is an explosion of interest in African music. African art lies at the intersection of all these things. I think people see in it a new relevance to their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditional African art sits at the center of African religion, healing, politics, social relations, gender relations and communal life, and it expresses all those values. Clearly, as one of the great, great art traditions, it will always have value to us. The fact that we know a lot about what the art means simply makes it more attractive and produces a new impetus to look more closely.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Haven't people turned to Africa before for ideas and inspiration?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: At the beginning of this century, the West's interest in African art came from the fact that contemporary Western artists were looking for formal solutions that they happened to see in African art. The now famous encounter of Picasso and his circle with African art was driven entirely by a search for new plastic forms. He didn't care what things meant, exactly who made them, or why -- he only cared about the way they looked. Many people still feel that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What about contemporary African art?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Contemporary Africa is acting out of something the rest of us are also struggling with -- the marriage, or confrontation of cultures.  African cities, like all of the major cities of the West, are polyglot and cacophonous. Africa has taken another route but independently arrived at the same point. Contemporary African art, invisible in the West until recently, is emerging as part of the critical nexus of art currents as the century closes. The melding of completely disparate cultural elements in contemporary Africa with cultural modes from Africa's ancient traditions has resulted in the independent creation of a transnational, postmodern aesthetic that continuously produces ideas and inspirations that are interesting to others.  Where better to reflect on the relationships between cultures, between the inherited and the newly invented, between the colonized and the colonizers, in the postmodern era?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where does the museum stand on the form vs. meaning question?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Clearly, the forms are transcendent and have merit on their own, but they are more satisfying with information. We have to make -- and we have always made -- information available to our audience, but in discrete ways, so that if they don't want it, they don't have to read it. We like our exhibitions to be comprehensible, coherent even without the labels; it's very important that the ideas be visual. Ideally a visitor who reads only the room title will be able to see why objects are in that room. But extensive labels, catalogs and books are available if people want to know more.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But can that solve all the dilemmas involved in presenting art that wasn't created to be viewed in a museum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: We have to accept that we are trying to present an aesthetic system that is African through a medium that is not African. A medium that is in many ways quite alien to Africa -- Western aesthetic systems, in Western exhibitions, and in Western architecture. We are trying to explain a whole other system of knowledge, using our system of knowledge to talk about it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a kind of built-in tension and paradox that no museum really solves. As soon as you exhibit African art in a museum, you're doing something anomalous, because none of it was meant to be in museums. This sort of tension is one of the things that our shows have examined and will continue to examine. We can only attempt to create exhibition spaces in which objects have some of the animate presence they have in Africa, where objects were intended to be seen in performance, surrounded by dense crowds, singing, dancing or feasting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where, then, does meaning reside when we view African art in the West?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Not all in one place. There are three participants in the life</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of an African artwork transposed to the West: the art object itself, the African artists and users, with their ideas and meanings, and the Western audience and presenters, with theirs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because we are dealing with an art that is generally unfamiliar, whose specific references are unknown to most visitors, people may feel freer to give their own readings, to have their own take, since the maker's authoritative voice isn't present telling them what to think or feel. But of course the information we make available can increase the audience's enjoyment of the art work a great deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What do you want your audience to come away with after a visit to the museum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Hunger. I want them to come away hungry. I want them to come away satisfied -- but not completely, eager to see more, to read more, to come back, to go to another museum. I want them to leave feeling they've had the appetizer to a sumptuous meal. But I also want them to leave comfortable.  We want the galleries to feel luxurious. We have very little money to do it with, but we will use textures, colors, lights and the availability of seating to make people feel comfortable while they're here. We hope that the design of the museum will speak to a very broad range of people and be so inviting that even non-museum-goers will come by to investigate and return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why all this comfort?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: I think that, after all, museum-going is about pleasure. It's a hedonistic business. What we really are presenting is just sheer pleasure, and if we don't do that, we've failed. Even the information has to be pleasurable. It has to give you a little tingle that comes from looking at something and saying, 'Oh, wow, that's what they meant.' So the space itself has to be physically comfortable, beautiful, welcoming and enjoyable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Why did you choose Maya Lin to design the interior and renovate your new building?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Her sympathy for non-Western culture was very important. Her interest in economy and recycling was quite important given our $1 million budget, but also because those are issues we are very much in sympathy with.  Her interest in using African colors and fabrics was very welcome. We engaged this brilliant young architect to design our new museum because more than almost any other artist, her work has been embraced by all generations and by elite and non-elite audiences with equal fervor. We want a museum for the future, and she represents it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides traditional museum-goers, tourists, artists, connoisseurs and scholars, what other audiences do you hope to attract?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Our museum has something that belongs very specially to all African Americans in this city and peoples of the African Diaspora everywhere. We are presenting their cultural heritage, a particularly brilliant one, and we are eager to make it available to Africa's descendants in America. We also want to introduce Americans of every stripe to African art and culture, but especially children, so they will grow up with a deeper appreciation and fuller respect for Africa and for what Africa has given to the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What are you most looking forward to in the new museum?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vogel: Getting to know the audience. Any exhibition is a dialogue with a space and with an audience. We're only guessing at this audience right now.  As we get to know them a little better, we'll become better at talking to them. It will take us a little time to get the right tone, the vocabulary, the subjects and the questions. We can only begin to formulate what people want to see, want to learn and what they want to hear. It is the adventure we've been waiting for.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ON THE JOB -- OFFICIALLY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two months in diplomatic limbo, the Clinton administration's principal African policy maker is about to assume his appointed role. George Moose, whose nomination as assistant secretary of State for African Affairs was announced on January 18, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week. Herman Cohen, President Bush's assistant secretary for Africa, remained in the post until March 19.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moose, who was deputy director of the Clinton transition team at the State Department, has been ambassador to Senegal and to Benin, both in West Africa. He also served in the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moose plans to name his own team to head key posts in the Africa bureau, beginning with the three deputy assistant secretaries. His choice for principal deputy is said to be Edward P. Brynn, the current U.S. ambassador to Burkina Faso. A second deputy slot is to go to Prudence Bushnell, who until recently was the second ranking official in the U.S. embassy in Senegal.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another U.S. ambassador with extensive Africa experience, Melissa Wells, has been appointed to a senior United Nations post. Prior to her selection this month, Wells was the American ambassador to Zaire. Her new job, which she assumes on April 5, is under-secretary-general for administration and management. She succeeds former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who served in the post after losing a U.S. Senate election race in Pennsylvania in 1992 (check).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ALL-STAR MOVIE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Arsenio Hall is making his first venture into film production with a South African-based drama set for release in the fall. The picture also will be the directing debut of award-winning actor Morgan Freeman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Called &quot;Bopha!&quot; the movie is a story about black police in South Africa, drawn from experiences of township life. Danny Glover stars as a South African policeman who is forced into painful choices between responsibilities to his job and the welfare of his family. The tale is an account of one man's life, played against the backdrop of the larger political struggle in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alfre Woodard has the part of the policeman's wife. Also starring are Marius Weyers, Malcolm McDowell, Malik Bowens and Maynard Eziashi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Paramount Pictures film was shot on location in Harare, Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor to the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GOING FOR THE GOLD</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You have my support and prayers,&quot; former Atlanta mayor and United Nations ambassador Andrew Young told officials of South Africa's Olympic Committee, who hope to bring the Olympic Games to South Africa in 2004. Young called the dream of the country's sports leaders &quot;incredible optimism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That says that all of your political problems will be solved, that your economy will be on an even keel&quot; by 1998, when bidding for the '04 games begins, Young said during his visit this month to South Africa, where he presented Atlanta's Olympic flag to South Africa's Olympic Committee chairman.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Young was in South Africa to open a three-day conference on &quot;Free and Fair Elections&quot; in Cape Town. &quot;If justice prevails in South Africa,&quot; he told conferees, &quot;it will spread not only throughout the African continent but also help cut back on the resurgence of racism in Western Europe.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DOUBLE TROUBLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian musician Fela Anikulapo Kuti was rearrested this month in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, only minutes after being freed on bail following his arrest on January 21. The charismatic and controversial star is known for blunt talk against government corruption that has stirred the ire of successive Nigerian governments, resulting in frequent imprisonment. In 1986 he appeared with an Amnesty International tour starring U2 and Sting, after being released from 20 months in jail.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fela, as he is called, faces a murder charge in the case of an electrician allegedly beaten to death by the performer's bodyguards during a dispute over payment. Fela's brother Beka Ransome Kuti, who presides over the Nigerian Human Rights Committee, said he expects charges of kidnapping and assault to replace the original one of murder. The release on bail came after a judge ruled that the government had insufficient evidence for the murder accusation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides having made a name for himself internationally as a pioneer of Afro-beat music, the 55-year-old musician has received attention for his eclectic philosophy that combines support for human rights with diatribes against equality for women. &quot;To call me a sexist ... for me it's not a negative name,&quot; he says in a new book Breakout, published by the University of Chicago Press. He once had 28 wives, although he says now that he is not married and does not believe in the institution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fela comes from a prominent Nigerian family of clerics and government officials. His mother was a leading advocate for women's rights and served as a cabinet minister before being killed in a bloody government raid on Fela's compound in 1977. His brother is a former Nigerian minister of health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> STANDING TALL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manute Bol, the tallest player in National Basketball Association (NBA) history, is a giant of a man in other ways as well, according to those who work with him. &quot;He cares about everyone everywhere,&quot; says Anna Michael, who works for the Sudan Relief Fund, Bol's humanitarian assistance foundation. Michael says the Sudanese ballplayer feels a special responsibility for his home continent, recently visiting Somalia, Mozambique and Ethiopia, as well as Sudan, to explore how he might help the victims of conflict there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bol's latest project has been sponsoring a March 27 gala to raise money for southern Sudan, where an estimated 700,000 people face immediate starvation and a further 800,000 are threatened by severe food shortages. The dinner and fashion show in Washington, DC, is co-chaired by Jesse Jackson and endorsed by Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly. A choir of five dozen African youngsters, mostly the children of diplomats, is performing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bol says the evening's proceeds will provide food, clothing and medicine for Sudanese children. &quot;I am feeling more and more,&quot; he says, &quot;that a concentrated effort on behalf of the children of Sudan is sorely needed. He says he has been heartened by support from NBA friends such as Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns, Chris Mullen of the Golden State Warriors, as well as Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets, who was expected to attend the fund-raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A new book about Bol's life, Manute: The Center of Two Worlds, has just been published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gala information: (703) 823-0400.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHEW!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An eight-volume, 6,000-page work by 300 scholars over 28 years is about to be completed with publication of the eighth and final volume. The General History of Africa, commissioned by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, begins with the prehistorical period and goes through the 1980s. The project attracted funding from sources as diverse as the Vatican and the government of Libya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> French historian Jean Devisse, who serves on the project's oversight committee, told the Associated Press that sharply different points of view prompted initial disputes among the international scholars who did the research and writing. But he said discussions led to &quot;a certain transformation of spirit, after which we began to work together.&quot; Devisse characterized the final product as a &quot;bilateral&quot; approach that is told from neither an African nor an outsider's perspective but is a synthesis of the two.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its entirety, the collection is expected to fill a gap, since most previous histories have been written by historians from ex-colonial powers.  Already, however, there have been criticisms that the work minimizes the flaws of African societies, while being unfailingly critical of the excesses of slavery and the colonial era.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ali Mazrui, a Kenyan who edited the final volume, concedes that the project is imperfect. As an example, he cites the supervisory committee's rejection of a proposal to picture an African woman on the final volume's cover -- a decision he suggests is symbolic of the fact that women's role in modern Africa has been neglected by the authors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SHE'S GOT A NERVE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Supporters of the African National Congress hissed and booed the wife of South African President F.W. de Klerk when she visited a mixed- race town in the Cape province recently. About 400 protesters greeted Marike de Klerk with revolutionary songs and derogatory posters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The president's wife normally avoids publicity, but she has been unable to live down a statement she was quoted as making four years ago when her son was involved in a relationship with a fellow student of mixed racial ancestry. According to the Johannesburg Sunday Times, she said that a mixed race person, known in South Africa as coloured, is &quot;someone that is not black and is not white and is also not an Indian, in other words, a non-person.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Zimbabwe's Supreme Court has slammed the door on the prospects of thousands of former white Rhodesians, who have been longing to reclaim the privileges many of them abandoned because they opposed or dreaded a black majority government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A judgment by the court has ruled that people born in the country have no automatic right to live and work there if they hold foreign citizenship.  This reverses a series of high court rulings last year, in cases fought between the Department of Immigration and white families who were trying to return to their former homes.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new ruling appears to shut off the last chance for a reprieve for an estimated 70,000 locally born whites who opted for foreign rather than Zimbabwean citizenship when President Robert Mugabe's government outlawed dual citizenship in 1984.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers say there are probably 50 families currently in Zimbabwe on short-term alien permits and fighting to stay. About 2,000 more families are hoping to return from abroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hugh Bisset, a lawyer representing several of the petitioners in Zimbabwe is pessimistic. &quot;I am in no doubt whatsoever they will be deported,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many of the families, nicknamed &quot;Rhodies,&quot; left before independence in 1980 to escape what they feared would become a communist tyranny as well as a black government they believed would take revenge for nearly a century of oppression by white settlers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Mugabe did not live up to the predictions that he would mistreat whites, and the violence in neighboring South Africa, the high cost of living in Britain and the blandness of Australia -- the three most popular destinations for the exodus -- has made life in Zimbabwe seem more appealing than it did earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even in the absence of racist laws, being white still seems to confer special privilege. Life in the suburbs and farms of Zimbabwe has changed little, except that there is now a sizable minority of blacks sharing the easy-going lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Graham Young, 48, a farmer, and his wife, Cilla, left Zimbabwe in 1983, because they were anxious about their children's schooling. They went to the small town of Lydenburg in South Africa. &quot;It was just different,&quot; says Graham. &quot;In South Africa you haven't got the bush and the open space. In Lydenburg, it was very right wing, everything was so narrow. So, after ten years, we just thought, 'What a dump, let's go back home.' It was never really not home, even while we were away.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Youngs took the Immigration Department to court and won the right to stay. But lawyers say last week's Supreme Court ruling means that immigration officials will go looking for the Youngs at the safari farm near Victoria Falls where Graham Young works.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It will be the same for Zimbabwe-born Barney O'Hara, a former game warden. He says he left in 1987 because he needed a specialist helicopter pilot's license for wildlife operations, and he could get it only in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he, too, opted for foreign citizenship and was refused the right to stay when he returned to Zimbabwe in 1991. He successfully challenged the Immigration Department in a lower court. Now, the high court says the $190,000 he spent on a house in Bulawayo, the $75,000 of goods he brought back, and the job he has as a helicopter pilot helping in the campaign against rhino poachers are not tickets to residency.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A brand new mini-van kicks up a cloud of red dust as it bounces along the uneven dirt road that winds its way through Orange Farm -- one of South Africa's largest shack communities. Johan du Plessis, an Afrikaner who speaks fluent Zulu, travels this route several times a week to survey the massive electrification project being carried out by the state- owned Electricity Supply Commission, or Eskom, South Africa's only electric company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Du Plessis, a tall, friendly person, is an Eskom public affairs executive. He regularly meets with residents whose lives have been transformed by the Orange Farm project, which has provided power to more than 70,000 self-built homes in the past two years.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eskom's campaign to electrify South Africa includes 245 projects throughout the country. Orange Farm, where Eskom has invested R28 million (about $9.3 million) is the largest. The utility company expects to recover these costs within 15 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New billboards line the road and advertise the many uses of electricity in Orange Farm, which du Plessis predicts will accommodate more than 250,000 homes in the next two years. One Eskom billboard shows a young black student studying late at night next to an electric</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lamp. &quot;Electricity gives you a light to learn by,&quot; it says. Another reads: &quot;Instant smokeless and smell-free cooking,&quot; and shows a frying pan sitting on an electric stove.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nearly seven million of South Africa's 30 million blacks live in informal or self-built housing and virtually none of those have access to electricity. For years the government neglected such settlements and failed to provide them with basic services. But with the dawning of a &quot;new South Africa,&quot; Eskom is moving into black townships and to places like Orange Farm, working to create a demand for its product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Previously, the perception had been that the people of Orange Farm hadn't wanted electricity and couldn't afford it,&quot; says du Plessis, who has worked for Eskom for over 18 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, as apartheid began to disintegrate, Eskom realized that it had an opportunity to negotiate the right of electric supply with black local authorities. The utility began a massive public relations campaign for a nationwide electrification scheme with the motto, &quot;Electricity for All.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the company began the campaign as a means to make money, the extension of electricity to more black households is seen as crucial to energizing South Africa's moribund economy and giving its industrial expansion a boost. Many shack dwellers have decent jobs and would like to buy electrical goods such as televisions, stoves and radios. All they need is a way to power them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It's much better since we have electricity,&quot; says Gloria Khumalo, 32, whose tin shelter now has a bright light hanging from its rafters. &quot;We had to use candles before.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Orange Farm shack number 2531 now supports a large television aerial on its roof. Emma Nkutha stands inside her kitchen wearing a housecoat and tennis shoes. &quot;I am very happy with the whole setup,&quot; she says, &quot;but my grandchildren are now watching too much television.&quot; The family recently bought a television set, a large hi-fi system, an electric stove and numerous lamps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Phumula Mqashi, an Orange Farm convenience store that used to be run from inside a shack, has expanded into three sturdy buildings. It now sells light bulbs and offers video games, an electric popcorn machine and a refrigerator full of cold drinks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African National Congress (ANC), which has led the fight for political reform in South Africa, supports the need for widespread electrification. &quot;How do you start a business with a (kerosene) lamp?&quot; asks William Cobbett, the ANC's representative on the National Electrification Forum, a transitional body in which Eskom participates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The metering system that Eskom has installed in each newly electrified home is a fairly simple process. Each family buys a certain amount of electricity at the beginning of the month and is issued a card to insert in home meters. The system &quot;puts the customer in control of consumption,&quot; says du Plessis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Who's in charge here? It also puts Eskom in control of its customer.  Since 1984, Soweto's residents have resorted to nonpayment boycotts to protest apartheid and the township's sub-standard services. Eskom has reduced the risk of nonpayment by having its customers pay for electricity before they use it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With the card system, people aren't able to boycott Eskom if they think the rates are unfair, &quot; says Mashupye Matlala, a planner for the Transvaal Rural Action Committee. &quot;People are concerned about losing their bargaining power because of the new metering system.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Eskom has its own bargaining chips in its campaign to convince more township residents to switch to electricity.  Electricity costs less than the low-grade coal whose smoke previously filled each home and caused lung disease. &quot;When I buy electricity for R10 (about $3), it lasts the whole month,&quot; says Emma Nkutha. &quot;Before, I used to buy a bag of coal for R12, and it would last only two weeks.&quot; A deterrent to many families, however, is that the customer is required to pay a R90 deposit for the meter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a state-protected monopoly, whose board of directors is appointed by the government, Eskom's management has had guaranteed investment, says Frank Vorhies, an American economist who runs Eco Plus, an independent environmental and economic consultancy in Johannesburg. &quot;They built huge power plants that the country didn't need, and now they need to create demand, so they've begun a huge public relations campaign. It's a new ploy on the part of Eskom to gather subsidies from the government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, due to a lack of demand, Eskom closed about $260 million worth of power plants. &quot;Now they are lobbying to say that electricity is a right and again the taxpayer is asked to pay it,&quot; says Vorhies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC, however, supports the rapid electrification of South Africa and is unconcerned about Eskom's status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We view it as an appropriate monopoly. We would want to retain it as a national asset and not privatize it, as was attempted in the late 1980s,&quot; says Cobbett. Although the utility should work within a legislative framework established by parliament, Cobett says, &quot;I don't think there should be political or governmental interference with the day-to-day running of Eskom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of its expansion program, Eskom has initiated negotiations to create a regional grid, or electrical network, that would connect all of the countries in southern Africa, including Tanzania, as well as the central African giant Zaire. While Zaire has tremendous power-generating potential, most countries in the region desperately need greater supplies of electricity. Many worry that Eskom, by controlling the grid, will dominate the sub-region and dictate choices about development and industrialization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC appears to be mindful of those suspicions and eager not to be seen as insensitive as it moves nearer to political power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to treat our neighboring states as partners and not simply markets,&quot; says the ANC's Cobbett.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire: getting here is half the challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First stop for my colleague Livia Montana and me is Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, where, we've heard, there is one of the few Zairean embassies willing to give instant visas to journalists. With no functioning government in Kinshasa, many Zairean diplomatic missions have received no money from home for up to a year. Several are desperate. We hear that the Ambassador to Japan sold the embassy building in Tokyo, pocketed the money and split. Here in Abidjan, the embassy staff apparently is eating with the proceeds from visa sales. The official who needs to sign our visa forms is three hours late getting to work. However, once he shows up and $80 per person is paid, the visas are issued in ten minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are no more international airline flights to Kinshasa, at least not for the moment. They were all suspended after the Army rampage in January when troops were paid with newly printed, valueless currency. We have to fly to Brazzaville, capital of neighboring Congo and then</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">make our way across the river to Kinshasa. There are two ways to do this: one of the ferries that ply the river crossing or a six-passenger plane. We hear that we're less likely to get hassled about our six cases of video equipment at the small airport, so we opt for the five-minute flight.  Fortunately, an &quot;expediter&quot; arranged through the U.S. Embassy is waiting to ease us through Customs and Immigration. No hassles. But an argument breaks out when the lone customs officer asks to inspect the bags of a returning Zairean businessman. The businessman refuses and is supported by all the other officials present. The Customs officer storms off in a rage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In downtown Kinshasa, businesses have rooms stacked from floor to ceiling with cash. Dozens of people work full-time counting money, storing it in metal foot lockers. Prices are regularly quoted by knocking off the last three zeroes. Numbers are easier to handle that way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other stacks in other rooms provide additional mute testimony to the breakdown of Zaire's political and economic culture. We saw rooms crammed floor to ceiling with condoms. One organization alone has 27 million condoms piled up in Kinshasa and no money to pay people to package and distribute them. The cutback in international aid and the evacuation of aid workers mean that some of Africa's most successful AIDS education and prevention programs are suspended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zaire is private enterprise run amok.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost all state institutions have ceased to function and the private sector, small and large, has stepped in to fill the void. There is no government to repair deteriorating roads, so poor people fill potholes and try to collect donations from passing motorists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the telephone system dysfunctional, a private company is doing a brisk business with a cellular phone network. Because we must make contact with many people in Kinshasa, as well as stay in touch with home, one of the first things we do is to rent a &quot;cellphone&quot; at $50 a day. Despite the expense, there is an advantage for journalists in this cellphone culture.  With the old phone system, any &quot;important&quot; person would have a secretary answering the phone, screening calls. But today's important people want to be seen with a cellphone sticking out of their pocket. When we dial, more often than not, the politician or general will be the one answering.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We quickly find, contrary to all we've been told before coming, that there is no problem shooting video, even with a big camera, away from the main streets. The only problem is trying to get some tape of real life. Every time we pick up the camera, dozens of people run in front of it to express their hatred for Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's ruler for 28 years. They hold up big wads of money and point to their stomachs, saying they have plenty of nearly worthless cash but are still hungry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shooting video near any major thoroughfare is quite a different story; it means almost certain arrest. There are police and military people in plain clothes all over the place. The site of a foreigner with a video camera enrages them. They ask to see our &quot;permission.&quot; We explain that since the Ministry of Information isn't working, there is no one to issue permission.  That is not considered a satisfactory response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first time we are picked up, it's by the &quot;gendarmes&quot; or police.  They take us to their nearby office for questioning. After 45 minutes, they decide that this problem has to be dealt with by higher authorities. We are taken, under armed guard, to district headquarters, where the commander listens to both sides of the story. He throws his hands in the air and says, &quot;Look, I'm supposed to deal with traffic problems for all of Kinshasa. But I don't even have a car. How am I supposed to deal with something like this?&quot; He decrees that we should be taken to the regional headquarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're first interrogated by a captain who is very rude and talks about foreign journalists defaming Zaire. Finally, he takes us upstairs to see the boss, a colonel who is a cousin of Mobutu. There are pictures of Mobutu all over the walls. The colonel listens to the arresting officer and then to us.  Finally, he declares that we were doing nothing wrong and tells us to carry on with our work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We explain that while we appreciate his attitude, it is not a position shared by the police and soldiers on the street. We ask if he can write a note saying we have his permission to go on with our work. He refuses, arguing that we don't need permission from anyone in Zaire to work as journalists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forty-eight hours later, we are under arrest again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time we are picked up in a poor neighborhood. A very agitated young man with an ID card identifying him as a member of the Civil Guard harangues us for not having permission to work as journalists. A crowd of several hundred gathers. Most of them are sympathetic to us. An army Jeep arrives and we are taken away to an army base. There, we discover that in the melee, as we were being arrested, our cellphone was lifted from Livia's shoulder bag. &quot;Don't worry,&quot; the soldiers -- suddenly accommodating -- say.  &quot;We'll help you get it back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The base commander orders that we be taken to Civil Guard headquarters. On the way, we stop by the place where we were arrested.  Soldiers jump out of the Jeep, run across the road, grab the first young man they come to, and throw him in the back of the Jeep. We speed off to another army base. This is the headquarters of the notorious Leopard Battalion of the Civil Guard. The compound is full of vehicles equipped to control civil unrest. There are large trucks fitted with turrets and water cannons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While we wait to be questioned, the soldiers begin interrogating the young man they picked up. He says he doesn't know anything about the stolen cellphone. That answer, too, is unsatisfactory. Our captors strip off the man's shirt and begin whipping him with his three-inch-wide leather belt decorated with metal studs, while we are forced to watch. The beating is so severe that the belt finally breaks. When they release us -- and the innocent young man -- eight hours later, they ask us to pay for the broken belt. Livia uses her crudest street French to tell them what we think of that idea.  *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tony Avirgan is a camera operator and reporter and Livia Montana is a producer for Africa News Service. We sent them to Zaire to do television coverage of the mounting crisis there.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When asked if he is hopeful about his continent's future, Salim Ahmed Salim is characteristically blunt. &quot;If I were cynical,&quot; says Africa's top statesman, &quot;I would say we can't go any lower from where we are.&quot; Hardly a diplomatic response coming, as it does, from the secretary- general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the regional body that represents 51 African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But having conceded the scope of the problem, Salim is quick to point to more positive possibilities. &quot;If I were to give you a balanced reaction I would say 'yes,'&quot; he says. &quot;There is a lot of optimism in (Africa) precisely because the things that we should have done ten years ago or 15 years ago -- and would have made a difference for our continent -- our people and our leaders realize they must be done today.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That sort of plain-spokenness has won the 51-year-old diplomat high praise from many of his colleagues. &quot;He has managed to bring the questions of pluralism and democratization into the mainstream of the OAU,&quot; says Salim Lone, who edits the United Nations journal Africa Recovery.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overhaul. Salim Salim's reputation for straight talk and energetic action has put him at the center of a drive to overhaul the OAU and develop African responses to African problems. But Salim is also a strong champion of Africa's successes, and he remains a vocal critic of the international community's weak response to African crises. In a talk earlier this month, he began by reminding his audience that one of the principal agendas of the OAU, the decolonization of the continent, has been fulfilled. &quot;This is no mean achievement,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we even dare to think of a free South Africa -- and we dare to do so not simply as idealists, but as realists.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim acknowledges that Africa has experienced declining living standards and expanding conflicts in the last decade. But he insists that there is a new African willingness to address issues of peacekeeping, democratization and economic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To insert the OAU into that process will not be easy. The organization that so effectively rallied Africa to banish colonialism is having a much tougher time addressing internal problems and wars.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, the organization is largely on the sidelines in efforts to restore peace to Somalia, Zaire, Angola and Mozambique, and the OAU's efforts to develop an African economic community have been stymied. But diplomats and other observers say that if anyone can push the OAU into a leadership role, Salim can.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born on the island of Zanzibar, which united with mainland Tanganyika in 1964 to become the new state of Tanzania, Salim has been an activist since his student days. His friends say he was influenced by his travels to revolutionary Cuba and Mao Tse Tung's China. His first diplomatic posts -- followed by many others -- was as ambassador to Egypt. At the age of 28, the already-polished young diplomat was posted to New York as Tanzania's representative to the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although he was one of the youngest members of the diplomatic corps, Salim quickly became known as a forceful advocate of decolonization and an outspoken opponent of apartheid. People close to Salim say that his subsequent views were shaped by those experiences and by his advocacy of the admission of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations, at a time when Taiwan was still occupying China's seat at the world body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although those early positions won him a year-long term as president of the General Assembly, where developing nations wield a majority of the votes, his reputation worked against him a decade later when both the United States and the Soviet Union opposed a bid to elect him secretary-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1980, Salim left the United Nations to become Tanzania's minister of foreign affairs and then briefly prime minister, before being passed over to succeed President Julius Nyerere. But Salim stayed in government, serving as Tanzania's defense minister until he won election as secretary-general of the OAU.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Salim works out of the OAU headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he lives with his wife, Amne, and their seven-year-old son, Ahmed. Their other son, Ali, is a medical student at Howard University, and they also have a daughter, Maryam, who works at the World Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Push for African peacekeeping. Salim describes his number-one priority as spearheading the drive to form an African peacekeeping force. At the OAU's annual meeting last July in Senegal, Salim pushed a &quot;Proposal for an OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention and Resolution.&quot; Although the proposal was actively opposed at the time by several African governments, a revised draft was debated again last month at a meeting of the OAU Council of Ministers, where the response was dramatically different. All but one of the 29 cabinet ministers attending spoke in favor. Sudan, itself gripped by civil war and the object of UN criticism for widespread human rights abuses, was the lone opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several diplomats and observers say that the U.S. action in Somalia accounts in part for Africa's new willingness to confront the challenges raised by Salim's plan. African leaders have been noticeably concerned at a situation which forces the continent to accept military expeditions by Western powers. But Salim says that, under the circumstances, U.S.  involvement was a welcome development. &quot;You cannot stand with your hands folded, in a situation like Somalia, and say the sanctity of the principle of noninterference does not allow for intervention.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim appears to have swayed African governments with his argument that if Africa is to achieve meaningful independence, it will have to save itself. &quot;If we have a mechanism in the OAU,&quot; he says, &quot;it will be possible in many of these crises that the first course of intervention will be from Africa itself, rather than from the outside.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a model, Salim offers the OAU's peacekeeping force in the East African nation of Rwanda. For more than a year, the OAU has been working with Tanzanian diplomats to facilitate the off-and-on negotiations between the government and the rebel Rwandese Patriotic Front. Late last year a 55-person OAU military observer group -- composed of troops from Senegal, Nigeria, Mali and Zimbabwe -- was put in place to supervise a cease-fire. Although the pact broke down earlier this year, a new agreement has been signed this month.  U.S. diplomats have praised the OAU peace effort, and last year the Bush administration provided $500,000 to help fund the Rwanda operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even if the intervention, which remains delicate, proves successful, Salim still must persuade African heads of state to establish a permanent peacekeeping mechanism -- a campaign he is pursuing aggressively in preparation for the OAU's next summit meeting in Cairo three months from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International observers expect a peacekeeping plan of some sort to emerge from the June meeting, but there is less optimism about whether it will be implemented. &quot;It is one thing to agree on paper,&quot; says Africa Recovery's Lone. &quot;But it's another to see what can be done in practice. The second battle will be implementation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Common market. Salim Salim acknowledges the distinction. &quot;One of our major problems in the continent,&quot; he says, &quot;has been the tremendous hiatus between declarations of intentions and implementation.&quot; He notes that the idea of continent-wide cooperation and economic integration have been debated at the OAU almost since its inception. The group's 1980 annual summit in Lagos, Nigeria, voted to begin a process of continental economic integration that would remove trade barriers between countries and create larger markets for African product.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It didn't work because the commitment wasn't there,&quot; says Salim. But he says that the economic crisis of the last decade has reordered priorities.  &quot;I think right now there is a real sense of recognition on the continent that economic integration is not an option; it is the only option in town.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the annual OAU meeting in 1991, African leaders signed an African Economic Community treaty. Salim is hopeful that by the time the OAU convenes in Cairo this year, the member countries will have ratified the document so that the structures to make it a reality can be put into place. Questioned about why Africa is not moving more quickly toward economic integration, Salim bristles slightly. &quot;It took four or five years to create the European Economic Community,&quot; he protests. &quot;It takes time.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Salim has focused his primary energy on remaking the OAU, he continues to be an outspoken critic of inequalities in the world economic system, which he sees as especially disadvantageous to Africa. &quot;Our people work harder today, produce more, but get less for what they produce,&quot; he says, referring to the decline in commodity prices that has ravaged African economies since the 1980s. &quot;We've been talking about democratization in individual African countries, but also there is a need for international democratization.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Support from Americans. In a recent speech on Capitol Hill during a visit organized by the New York-based African American Institute, Salim appealed to his audience to halt Africa's slide to &quot;the periphery of the periphery&quot; of world concerns. &quot;My fear is that because Africa is no longer considered to be of geopolitical importance,&quot; he told his audience, &quot;there is a danger that the world will not take seriously some of the problems on the continent.&quot; A bank for reconstruction has been formed with more than $10 billion in initial capital to assist the countries of what used to be called Eastern Europe, Salim said, but very little new assistance has been forthcoming for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acknowledging the historical and cultural links between African Americans and Africa, Salim said he saw nothing wrong with organizing a black constituency to raise the interests and concerns of Africa with the new Clinton administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim returned to that theme when a young African American graduate student from Howard University stood up at a forum sponsored by the Washington Office on Africa, a church and trade union lobby group. After encouraging him to finish his studies, Salim responded to the student's appeal for advice on how people like himself could help Africa. &quot;We do not want Americans to do things which Africans can do for themselves,&quot; he said.  &quot;But it is absolutely essential that our friends -- and we certainly consider the Americans our friends -- understand what we are doing and assist us in areas where they can.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Salim pointed to the issue of Africa's crippling foreign debt as an example of how Americans who care about Africa can be most helpful. &quot;There are no financial arguments about debt relief,&quot; he said, insisting that wealthy nations and international financial institutions respond primarily to political pressures. Africa bears the heaviest proportional burden of the world's debt crisis; most African countries find their development plans foundering against the implacable drain of debt repayments. Salim and other African diplomats argue that Africa's people should not shoulder the entire burden of poor economic decisions made by the continent's past generation of leaders and the Western governments and institutions that advised them and provided the loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political considerations, Salim says, are what have propelled debt relief for other regions, such as Latin America and Eastern Europe. There have been, he says, constituencies for those measures. To Americans who want to make a difference in Africa, Salim offers a challenge to domestic political organizing. &quot;Why don't you build a constituency for Africa?&quot; he asks.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The four-man AfricaTrek bicycle team spent four days in Yaounde, Cameroon, for repairs and recuperation before heading out for Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, where they expected to cross the Oubangui River into Zaire this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expedition is traveling overland from Bizerte, Tunisia, to Cape Agulhas, South Africa, a grueling 12,000-mile-trip, which should take the group through 14 countries. Averaging about 47 miles a day so far, the three American cyclists and one African, who left Tunisia November 28, will traverse the continent twice before reaching the southernmost tip of Africa sometime around August 15. The team aims to set a world record, stir international interest in Africa and gather scientific data. Students in 25,000 schools across the United States are following the trip through curriculum materials, newsletters and a telephone update line.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The main reason for the Yaounde stop was to find a new back wheel rim for team leader Dan Buettner's Cannondale mountain bike. Buettner, from Minneapolis, MN, cracked his aluminum rim while traveling between Mamfe and Dschang, Cameroon, on a rugged dirt road with &quot;softball-sized rocks.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steve Buettner, Dan's brother and the team's designated repairman, fashioned a replacement with the only size rim available locally -- which was one inch too large -- cutting a section out of the rim and welding it back to fit the 26-inch tires carried by the team.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The repair gave team member Mobolaji Odouyoye, from Lagos, Nigeria, the chance to recover from a bout of malaria, which hit him in western Cameroon. Running a high fever and unable to continue the ten- hour cycling days, Odouyoye, accompanied by team doctor Chip Thomas, who was recovering form malaria himself, took a bush taxi the last 194 miles to the capital city of Yaounde and rejoined the Buettner brothers there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ride through Cameroon followed nearly a week in Odouyoye's hometown of Lagos, where they were feted by the minister of sport and put up in a four-star hotel. The revitalized cyclists made up lost time by averaging 80 miles a day after leaving Lagos, despite harsh road conditions in western Cameroon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along the way, in Ogoday, a small Nigerian village, the team members were declared princes of the Mbembe people by the village chief during their overnight stay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a fair amount of palm wine drinking prior to the initiation,&quot; said Dan Buettner, the 32-year-old expedition organizer. After the ceremony, which was held in a mud structure jammed with people where &quot;lizards ran across our feet,&quot; Buettner asked for a show of hands of others who were princes, and &quot;half of those in the room raised their hands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Well, it sounds impressive,&quot; he said whimsically, about having been installed as African royalty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Between Yaounde and Mangui, three members of the AfricaTrek team have been celebrating birthdays. Thomas, who hails from Durham, NC, but practices medicine on a Navaho Indian reservation in northern Arizona, turned 30 on March 6, while Odouyoye was 32 on March 18. Steve Buettner, from Saint Paul, MN, became 28 on February 28.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the 800 miles of mostly dirt road separating the two cities, the group still managed over 70 miles a day. En route, the terrain changes from tropical rain forest to grassy savannah. On the next leg, through northern Zaire, the bicyclists expect to encounter the upcoming rainy season, known as the &quot;mango rains&quot; because they coincide with the ripening of those tropical fruits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the mud will slow their progress to about 20 miles a day, team members, who each have lost several pounds sharing rice, tomato sauce and bananas with villagers along the way, say they will be looking forward to the mangoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The expedition will be out of touch for about a month while navigating the rain forest of Zaire. Dan Buettner says the four riders are a bit uneasy about the possibility of encountering violence in Zaire, which is in severe political and economic crisis. But he believes they will be safe by sticking to a route through northern villages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cyclists expect to arrive about April 20 in Kampala, Uganda, where Odouyoye will say farewell and a Ugandan rider will join the team for the remaining distance. *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In Angola, although the United Nations has been charged with overseeing a peaceful transition to democracy, it has had few resources to employ. Only about 220 UN personnel are in the country, which is three times the size of California and racked by war between government forces and the opposition movement known as Unita, or Union for the Total Independence of Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 1991 peace accord ending 16 years of fighting between the Soviet-supported government and U.S. and South Africa-backed rebels gave the UN responsibility for supervising the cease-fire and for verifying the outcome of the country's first free elections. But proposals for a monitoring mission modeled on the successful 1989 operation in neighboring Namibia were rejected as too costly by the major powers, who foot the largest share of UN bills.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, the Security Council agreed to dispatch 476 military observers and police monitors plus 400 election monitors to Angola, compared with the 6,000 sent to Namibia, which has one-tenth of Angola's 10 million people. The Angolan elections of last September were judged generally free and fair by the observers. But the planned disarming of the combatants and formation of a unified national army never took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita leader Jonas Savimbi rejected the results of the balloting and charged fraud after official results showed him losing to President Eduardo dos Santos in the presidential race. In mid-October, before a peaceful resolution could be found, the two sides were back at war, with both apparently guilty of atrocities and provocations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN efforts to organize a run-off election between dos Santos, who got 49.57 percent of the vote in September, and Savimbi, who won 40.07 percent, have been thwarted by the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this month, Savimbi condemned the United Nations and called for replacement of its envoy in Angola, British diplomat Margaret Anstee. In a speech broadcast by the Unita radio station, Savimbi said Anstee &quot;has no experience in African affairs&quot; and &quot;is no longer useful&quot; to the negotiating process. He accused her of &quot;rigging&quot; the election and said &quot;she has all her friends&quot; in Luanda, the government-controlled capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want a person of prestige and, if possible, an African,&quot; Savimbi said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the past several weeks, a fierce battle has been waged for control of Huambo, Angola's second largest city and Unita's headquarters. Most observers believe the fighting is the most intense Angola has experienced in over three decades of pre-independence and post- independence warfare. In his speech, Savimbi said that the ferocity of the 55 days and nights of violent clashes &quot;has never been seen before in African military theaters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After being forced by Unita to withdraw from the city earlier this month, government troops began moving reinforcements into the area, signaling a continuation of a three-month-long seesaw contest that has claimed an estimated 15,000 lives already. No outside food or medical assistance has reached the city's residents since early January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiations convened last month by Anstee to end the fighting were adjourned when the Unita delegation failed to appear. Unita said it was unable to make use of the UN offer to airlift its negotiating team from Huambo because of intensified shelling of the city's airport by government forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A March 15 Security Council resolution condemns Unita for not attending the talks and for &quot;persistent violation&quot; of the 1991 peace agreement. The resolution notes &quot;with satisfaction&quot; the government's willingness to take part in negotiations. The council called for a meeting &quot;at the highest possible level&quot; between the two sides prior to April 30, when the mandate for the UN operation in Angola expires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended a complete UN pull-out from Angola if progress toward peace is not achieved by that date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the council rebuffed Anstee's request for a peacekeeping force of 8,000 or more to strengthen the UN's hand in restoring peace. The call for troops was opposed by the United States, which is pursuing agreement from both sides for a truce and disarmament leading to a runoff presidential vote.  State Department officials got the nod to their proposals from Angolan government representatives in a meeting on February 23 in Lisbon. Efforts are underway to hold talks on the plan with a high-level team from Unita that is making a ten-nation tour of Africa, Europe and the United States this month to explain Unita's positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the Security Council deliberations, the United States also opposed an Angolan government request for permission to make purchases of arms and ammunition. The 1991 accord bars arms transfers to either party by the three countries making up a trilateral observer team -- the United States, Portugal and Russia. But the Angolan government argues that the provision should not be interpreted as preventing a member state of the UN from defending itself against attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Diplomatic sources report that U.S. pressure has been applied to persuade countries such as Brazil and Argentina not to provide Angola with weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, two South African newspapers have reported that weapons, food and other supplies are being shipped to Unita from South Africa. The Weekly Mail in Johannesburg said arms are being sent from Mmabatho airport in the nominally independent territory of Bophuthatswana in Soviet-made aircraft. The Pretoria News quoted sources in the Foreign Ministry saying it is &quot;more than likely&quot; that shipments are taking place, with indirect official acquiescence.  *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the wars that shattered various parts of Africa over the past decade have been brought to an end, often with the United Nations cast in the part of peacemaker. It is a role that seems ripe for revival.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are four current UN peacekeeping operations in Africa, with another in the proposal stage, and appeals for help from several other quarters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But budget restrictions and a variety of other constraints have hampered UN efforts, and one of the African operations -- in Angola -- is in complete disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Months of increasingly intense fighting have elevated Angola to the largest-scale war in the world today, even though the United Nations has been playing an intermediary role since 1988, alongside major world powers. In a March 12 resolution, the UN Security Council warned that &quot;a humanitarian tragedy of grave proportions is developing&quot; in Angola and demanded an &quot;immediate cease-fire throughout the country.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN's troubled roadshow in Angola is reflective of shortcomings elsewhere, particularly when the setting is Africa. In Somalia, the world body seemed powerless to prevent an increasingly chaotic situation from developing into a major disaster last year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN plan for an independence referendum in Western Sahara, stymied by disagreements over voter eligibility, has been left in the wings for more than a year. UN troops slated for deployment to Mozambique last October, to oversee the end of a long-running civil war, only began arriving last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fair share? Active conflicts in Africa are affecting more people and threatening more lives than all the fighting in other parts of the world today. But only 15 percent of UN military and civilian peacekeeping personnel are posted to Africa, and less than 12 percent of the UN's current annual $2.8 billion peacekeeping budget is allocated for African operations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those percentages will rise beginning in May when UN troops take over the relief and protection role that a U.S.-led coalition force has been playing in Somalia since December. The Somali operation is expected to cost about $1.5 billion during its first year and involve 20,000 troops, 8,000 logistics personnel and 2,800 civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the projection is accurate, Somalia will become the most costly peacekeeping effort anywhere, surpassing Cambodia and straining an already overextended UN peacekeeping fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Restore Hope is a potluck affair,&quot; says one U.S. official, referring to the current coalition effort in Somalia. Each country is paying its own way, except for a few smaller nations, like Botswana, which has 300 troops in Somalia. Their presence is being subsidized by monies from contributors like Japan and Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Funding for the reconstituted United Nations Operation in Somalia, known as Unosom, will come through the United Nations, which is already owed over a billion dollars in outstanding members' contributions. Last week's resurgence of fighting in Kismayu underscores the possibility that the level of engagement in Somlia -- and the costs -- could escalate still further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to peacekeeping expenditures, Somalia needs an estimated $166 million in outside assistance for food, health programs, refugee resettlement, education and reconstruction. Most of the amount needed was pledged at a UN-sponsored donors conference earlier this month in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A subsequent UN-convened meeting, also in Ethiopia, brought together some 250 Somali participants to debate an agenda for national reconciliation.  The conference was the broadest-based effort so far to forge a political consensus, involving not only the leaders of warring factions, but intellectuals, clan elders, and the heads of civic, religious and women's organizations as well as leaders of warring factions, but it was suspended when fighting resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking to the gathering, the UN secretary-general's newly appointed deputy special representative, Lansana Kouyate, warned delegates that world patience with continued strife in Somalia is wearing thin. &quot;Peace is Somalia's only salvation,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Big move. In Mozambique, a massive refugee repatriation is set to begin next month, although over 100,000 people already have returned on foot.  About 1.3 million Mozambicans fled the southwest African nation, most of them to next-door Malawi, during 16 years of civil war. The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Sadako Ogata, says the resettlement will be the largest ever undertaken by her agency in Africa and will cost more than $30 million for the first year. The return of all the refugees is expected to take three years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The bitter conflict, which claimed an unusually high number of civilian casualties, ended with a peace accord last October. The cease-fire between government forces and the rebel movement known as Renamo has had relatively few violations, despite the delayed arrival of the UN monitoring force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the delay, elections slated to take place in October are expected to be postponed until next year. UN officials have emphasized a determination to avoid a repetition of the violent post-election period in Angola, which like Mozambique has been at war since its independence from Portugal in the mid-1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During a visit to the United States last month for talks with UN and American officials, Angola's Roman Catholic Archbishop Jaime Goncalves, the chief mediator in three years of peace talks, called for a rapid increase in the UN presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Waiting and waiting. In Western Sahara, the problem has not been late deployment of UN troops. Some 300 soldiers from 26 nations have been in place in the territory for the past 18 months, but the referendum they are there to monitor has not been held.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A UN plan calls for voters to choose between independence and incorporation into Morocco, which took control when Spain pulled out in 1975 and asserts a historical claim. The independence movement Polisario wants to use the last Spanish census as the starting point for establishing voter eligibility, while Morocco has moved in tens of thousands of people it says have Saharan ancestry and ought to be allowed to cast ballots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a March 2 resolution, the Security Council called for implementation of the UN settlement plan &quot;without further delay&quot; and asked the secretary-general to &quot;intensify&quot; negotiations and to report back on his progress by May. The council said the referendum should be held before the end of this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More on the way. Despite the problems UN activities are encountering, other problem spots are likely to wind up on the world body's agenda soon.  The Security Council last week agreed to consider sending a peacekeeping force to the East African nation of Rwanda, to augment a monitoring force provided by the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana has called for UN action to help end a civil war and restore a cease-fire that broke down early this year. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, fighting to oust Habyarimana, said it launched new attacks after several hundred minority Tutsi people were killed by supporters of the Hutu-dominated government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than a million of Rwanda's seven million people have been uprooted by the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the West African nation of Liberia, where a civil war that began in late 1989 uprooted over a million people out of a population of 2.6 million, UN peacekeeping help is being sought.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia was founded by freed American slaves in 1847, and like Somalia has been one of the largest U.S. aid recipients in sub-Saharan Africa. So Liberians expected the United States to intervene promptly to stop the carnage. Instead, after the country disintegrated into chaos, a multinational West African peacekeeping force stepped in to restore order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After two years of negotiations, fighting resumed last October, sparked by an assault on the West Africans by the country's largest armed group, the National Patriotic Front led by Charles Taylor. In recent weeks, West African troops have driven the rebels from long-held positions west, south and east of the capital, Monrovia. The Nigerian-led force seems intent on forcing Taylor to abide by the terms of a previously accepted peace plan, calling for disarming troops, opening the country's roads and holding nationwide elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN secretary-general, in a report to the Security Council this month, endorses the West African peace effort and says a UN role in the crisis should support the regional initiative. A decision to commit UN observers to the peace process should await a &quot;cessation of hostilities,&quot; the secretary-general says, but his special representative, Trevor Gordon- Somers, will return to Monrovia to explore possibilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, where negotiations on a transition to majority rule continue, a 50-person UN monitoring team has arrived to assist efforts to end political violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There also are calls for United Nations intervention in Sudan, where hundres of thousands of people have died and 1.5 million are at risk as a result of continuing conflict between Islamic fundamentalist government forces and an insurgency movement seeking autonomy for the Christian and animist southern region of the country. A UN relief operation is charged with getting food and other emergency assistance to the afflicted population, but no plans for sending a peacekeeping force have been advanced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amidst the agony of continuing conflict, Africans find some solace in the ending of several long-running wars in recent years. Besides the fragile peace pacts in Somalia, Mozambique and Western Sahara, armed struggles in Namibia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad and Uganda have wound down or been halted through negotiations or elections.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">OFF AND RUNNING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After several false starts, Nigeria's presidential campaign is moving into high gear. Two candidates, both of them rich businessmen, have emerged from the throng of aspirants -- Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and Bashir Tofa from the National Republican Convention (NRC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abiola is a Muslim from the Christian-dominated south who became wealthy while heading ITT-Nigeria. He now chairs the Nigerian Stock Exchange and owns a media conglomerate, which includes the Concord newspapers and the London-based magazine, Africa Economic Digest. Tofa, a northern Muslim from Kano state, is a millionaire banker. He served as finance secretary during the previous civilian administration, which was overthrown in a 1983 coup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both men have close ties with the current president and military leader Ibrahim Babangida. In 1990, Tofa called for Babangida to stay in power until the year 2000. With Nigerians clamoring for a break with the past, many observers believe that Tofa's ties to former regimes makes Abiola the more likely winner of the scheduled June 12 contest.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida's administration nullified presidential primaries held last September, saying that the process was tainted by widespread fraud. He directed the two parties to restart the nomination process, beginning at the local level and culminating in the national party conventions that last month nominated Abiola and Tofa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DYING FOR ATTENTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Charles Taylor, head of the largest armed faction in Liberia, says he will never surrender to West African peacekeeping troops in his country. He wants a United Nations force to intervene to stop the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the UN Security Council, in a resolution adopted on March 26, endorsed a continuation of the regional initiative by members of the Economic Community of West African States. A seven-nation West African force, known as Ecomog, has been in Liberia since late 1990, in an effort to keep the factions apart and hold elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ernest Shonekan, the head of Nigeria's transitional government, appealed for American backing for the West African effort during a visit to Washington last month. Without Ecomog, Shonekan said, &quot;Liberia would undoubtedly have degenerated to the unfortunate state now being witnessed in Yugoslavia and Somalia.&quot; He said Nigeria has no intention of dictating an outcome in Liberia and is interested only in ensuring that Liberians be allowed to choose a democratic government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Taylor views Nigeria as his enemy, and since his troops attacked Ecomog positions last October, war has raged through much of the country.  &quot;Ecomog is a warring faction,&quot; Taylor said in an interview late last month with journalists from the BBC, Radio France International and Reuters at his headquarters in Gbarnga. &quot;We will never negotiate with Ecomog, ever.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AIDS COSTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the largest AIDS information and health centers in Uganda is introducing cost-sharing for tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beginning this month, the AIDS Information Center (AIC), a semi-official body, will ask clients and patients to pay an as yet unspecified percentage of the cost for tests. For the last three years, an average of about 180 clients have received AIDS testing services free from the center, located in the Ugandan capital, Kampala.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each test costs about $18. The annual budget of AIC is $1.2 million, 90 percent of which is provided by a grant from the U.S. Agency for International Development. The executive director of AIC, Frank Nabwiso, says the center can no longer afford free tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Uganda has one of the highest incidents of AIDS in Africa, with figures in some towns suggesting that up to 30 percent of sexually active adults could be HIV carriers. The country simply cannot cope. The annual per capita income in Uganda is $238, and its expenditure on health is only $1 per person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A report released March 12 by the AIDS Control Program, the government's main research and advisory body on AIDS, had more gloomy news about the disease. The rate of HIV infection has risen sharply among girls aged 15 to 19 in the last half of 1992, the report says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Out of about 2,000 teenage hospital patients who turned out to be HIV positive or to have full-blown AIDS, 300 were males while 1,700 were females.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Doctors here blame those statistics on female dependence on men in Uganda's male-dominated society and on what is called here the &quot;Sugar Daddy Phenomenon.&quot; Wealthy male adults are &quot;raiding&quot; this age group, apparently believing that younger females are less likely to be infected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1990, as cases of rape and defilement of girls in their lower teens rose, the law was tightened to raise the consenting age for sex from 14 to 18. The penalty was increased to life imprisonment for attempted rape, and the maximum penalty for rape and defilement was raised from life imprisonment to death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None of this seems to have helped much, and a proposal to castrate men who rape or have affairs with underage girls was shouted out of the legislature when it was proposed by a radical feminist parliamentarian.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Charles Onyango-Obbo in Kampala</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TWO GOVERNMENTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Zaire, two sets of Cabinet ministers have been chosen, but neither is able to govern. And with political tensions rising, there are fears of a crackdown by the country's long-serving ruler, Mobutu Sese Seko.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi presented his list of selections last month to the High Council of the Republic, the interim legislative body chosen last year by a national democracy conference to lead the country to elections. The council endorsed Tshisekedi's choices, although there was some dissatisfaction expressed that the prime minister had not acted earlier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an attempt to outmaneuver pro-democracy forces, Mobutu, ignoring the High Council, has moved to establish his own new administration, naming Faustin Birindwa, a former Tshisekedi ally, to the prime ministership. Mobutu also convened the national assembly, the former one-party parliament that rubber stamped his programs before domestic and international pressure forced the recognition of opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States, Belgium and France -- Zaire's principal financial backers -- have called on Mobutu to cede all effective authority to the High Council and to allow elections to be held. Last week, France for the second time in a month refused to give Mobutu a visa to visit one of his luxurious residences on the French Riviera.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At home, Mobutu has continued to make life difficult for his opponents. Human rights and political leaders report the harassment of several opposition figures, and Tshisekedi's residence came under fire from troops believed to be loyal to Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANOTHER BOMBSHELL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa may have destroyed its nuclear weapons, but the government still wants to press ahead with an advanced non- nuclear missile program, amid concerns that South Africa's nuclear capacity is larger than has been disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pretoria has developed a sophisticated long-range ballistic rocket, based on the Israeli Jericho missile, with an estimated range of nearly 500 miles. During discussions in Washington last month with South African Foreign Minister Roelof 'Pik' Botha, U.S. officials called for cancellation of the rocket program. Although Botha offered assurances that the missile technology is being converted from possible military application to peaceful purposes, Clinton administration officials say they are not satisfied and may consider using economic leverage to underline their concern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Vital World Bank and International Monetary Fund backing for South Africa, which is expected once a nonracial interim government takes power, could be withheld if a costly missile development effort is continued, official sources say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last month's announcement by President F.W. de Klerk said South Africa had built six nuclear weapons after launching a clandestine production program in 1974. The bombs were dismantled in 1989, he said. Many experts believe Pretoria decided to destroy the nuclear devices in order to keep them out of the hands of a black-led government that may come to power in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there are concerns that the public disclosure may be covering up a far more advanced program involving battlefield nuclear weapons. A Cape Town academic, Renfrew Christie, who was jailed in 1980 for passing nuclear secrets to the African National Congress, says South Africa almost certainly developed a two-kiloton nuclear shell. He believes a 10-kiloton bomb may have been produced, as well.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TANZANIA TENSIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Racial and religious tension in Tanzania is on the rise, as the East African nation prepares for its first multiparty election after 30 years of one-party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ruling Chama Cha Mapunduzi, or CCM, which means Revolutionary Party in Swahili, is facing opposition from a new crop of politicians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most serious challenge comes from the Democratic Party (DP), led by the controversial and charismatic Christopher Mitikila, a Protestant pastor. The DP slogan, Saa Ya Ukombozi Ni Sasa, which translates in English as &quot;The time for liberation is now,&quot; has cast Mitikila as a radical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mitikila has been criticizing CCM's handling of the democratization process and has rejected newly issued party registration procedures as &quot;undemocratic.&quot; To prove that they are national organizations, parties are required to provide a list of up to 200 supporters from each region, including the island of Zanzibar, which in 1964 was joined with the mainland -- then called Tanganyika -- to form the present United Republic of Tanzania.  The ruling CCM was formed as a merger of the mainland Tanganyikan National Union and the Zanzibari Afro-Shirazi Party following a 1964 revolution on the island, ending Arab domination there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mitikila is portraying the 19-year union with Zanzibar as disadvantageous for the mainlanders. Tanzania's President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, himself a Zanzibari, is being cast as an &quot;expatriate&quot; president. Such rhetoric has heightened racial consciousness. Zanzibaris, as well as Tanzanians of Asian and Arab origin, are now being labeled with a word that suggests sexual perversion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is criticism of the union on Zanzibar as well. Last year, the island took up membership in the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), a grouping of Islamic nations, stirring criticism from non-Muslims throughout Tanzania and raising question about the future of the union's status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Religion also has become an issue at the University of Dar es Salaam, the country's oldest and principal university. When new fees were introduced last October, students united in protest. But now there are indications that Muslim students will receive financial assistance through the OIC, creating divisions within student ranks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- Oloya Aliker Tebere in Dar es Salaam</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CAMPUS CLASHES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The University of Ghana has closed its doors indefinitely following two days of clashes between students and police that left two students critically injured and wounded at least 20 others. The worst violence occurred when police forces invaded the campus to disperse students protesting government refusal to increase financial assistance for education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict complicates an already difficult political climate. Jerry Rawlings, who took power in a 1981 military coup, was elected president last October. But the results were rejected by leading opposition parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> University students began boycotting classes on March 17 to demand an increase in education loans from $145 to $320 a year. The Ministry of Education, according to student leaders, has rebuffed their calls for negotiation. Leaders of the National Union of Ghana Students maintain that the demonstrations were calm until heavily armed police intervened. Students and teachers say one of the police contingents involved belongs to a special commando unit, called the &quot;Panthers,&quot; set up a few years ago to take orders directly from Rawlings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The last time police fired on students was in 1978, when units invaded the university with tanks and armored vehicles to quell student protests against military rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Washington, DC</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the United Nations prepares to take charge of the humanitarian mission in Somalia, precedents for future interventions are being set. It is therefore particularly important that structural problems in the Somali operation be examined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International response to famines tends to follow a common formula.  Food aid comes first, while such considerations as the provision of health care and the resettlement of displaced people are factored in later, if at all.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Somalia, such an approach introduces serious problems for the recovery effort. The focus of &quot;Operation Restore Hope&quot; has been the protection of food relief efforts. That priority must be changed. The goal now should be to protect the local production of food supplies, rather than to guard the distribution of imported food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Continuing to distribute relief through feeding centers and refugee camps simplifies the task of foreign aid workers, but it also promotes dependence and erodes self-reliance. In addition, centralized food distribution centers like those set up in Somalia are breeding grounds for disease and magnets for armed militias. The key to the success of Unosom, the United Nations Operation in Somalia, is a redirection of the aid effort. The country's traditional subsistence economy must be supported, not undermined.  Food aid should supplement, not replace, local agriculture and other forms of economic activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first test for Unosom is speedy and efficient restoration of the country's agricultural and pastoral ways of life. Resettlement areas must be militarily secured. Productive farms and pastoral areas should be designated as safe havens and protected by troop deployments and air reconnaissance.  Rather than being spread throughout the country, Unosom troops should be concentrated in areas where the most vulnerable groups need protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of Somalia's six major clan groups, the Rahanwayn people probably have suffered the most. Living in a fertile region between the country's two major rivers, the Jubba and the Shabeelle, the Rahanwayn produce much of Somalia's food during normal times. But they and other nearby farming communities long have been politically and culturally subordinated in Somalia's pastoral society. During the civil war they have been subjected to vicious attacks by various militias.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Somalia last month, I visited half a dozen camps for displaced Rahanwayn. Not one family to whom I spoke had been consulted or contacted about resettlement, although many are eager to return home once security is assured.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overflights of these farmers' lands reveal an excellent crop in the fields -- but no one is there to harvest it. This guarantees that food relief will be required for at least an additional year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Livestock, another potential source of food and foreign exchange, is also being neglected. Somalia's population has a higher proportion of pastoralists than any country in Africa, and livestock raising makes good sense in a country of frequent drought and semi-arid terrain. A relatively minor investment could revive the country's herds, but aid advisors generally undervalue this sector and little animal restocking has begun.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In more densely populated southern Somalia, U.S. Army Engineers and Navy Seabees are rebuilding roads, schools and hospitals throughout the area.  Money goes fast when it is spent this way. Longer-term benefits could be achieved with locally planned, labor-intensive efforts. More funds should be spent on teaching materials, teachers' salaries and primary health care networks and less on new buildings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If outside consultants and contractors sponge up the bulk of donated resources, a golden opportunity will be lost. Rehabilitation efforts could play the dual role of creating employment for Somalis while promoting disarmament. Jobs should be offered to Somalis who turn in their guns, providing an attractive alternative to militia membership for the many who joined as a way to survive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, an emphasis on local reconstruction initiatives and restoration of the subsistence economy could play an important role in political reconciliation. The recent round of peace talks in Ethiopia, which drew representatives from a cross section of Somali groups, resulted in tentative agreement on a government structure based on strong regional representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An attempt to build on that process could counter the tendency of international aid efforts to strengthen the richest in society more than protecting the neediest. In Somalia, the rich have gotten richer in several ways. The militias have used their armed might to strip the country of all assets. They have stolen livestock from the defenseless, extracted payoffs from the non-governmental relief organizations, and contracted with aid providers at usurious rates to provide a multitude of services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The wealthy elite has reaped a harvest of money through currency transactions, illegal trade, transport and construction contracts, and the provision of supplies to troops from the United States and other nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In such a situation, a political solution must be built from the local level up -- not from the national level down. Where the U.S. operation initially concentrated on cultivating convenants between the militarily powerful militias, the UN should pursue a vigorous, broader-based diplomatic initiative involving clan elders, women's and community organizations, politicians, and professionals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Any real progress toward reconstruction also requires drastic reductions in the stock of weapons in Somalia. Allied military forces should be seizing and destroying all guns they can find. They should work with Ethiopian and Kenyan authorities to stop militias from preying upon refugee camps on Somalia's borders. The United Nations should identify arms dealers and prosecute them for violating the UN arms embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A reorientation of Unosom's approach to relief, restoration and reconciliation could yield enhanced prospects for a successful mission in war-weary Somalia. And positive results would demonstrate that humanitarian intervention can successfully save populations at risk of starvation or genocide elsewhere.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the gravity of the problems we face, I would venture to say that we have made more global human progress in the last 50 years than in the previous 2,000, to the point that three- quarters of the world's population now enjoy the basics of a life of dignity, productivity and health -- progress achieved while much of the world freed itself from colonialism and while respect for human and political rights expanded dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What we have not seen, however, is the automatic trickling down of economic and technological advances to the world's more than one billion poor. The most obscene manifestation of this failure is the 35,000 child deaths each day, two-thirds from causes now readily preventable at low financial cost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The problem is not that we have tried to eradicate global poverty or even its worst symptoms and failed; it is that no serious and concerted attempt has ever been made!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is now actually possible to provide virtually every man, woman and child on earth with adequate food, clean water, safe sanitation, primary health care, family planning and basic education -- by the end of the century and at an affordable price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We see this clearly demonstrated in the universal child immunization effort, which, since the mid-1980s, in the largest peacetime collaborative effort in world history, is saving the lives of some 10,000 children a day -- more than 3 million a year. A similar process is now underway with respect to oral rehydration therapy against the single greatest historical killer of children -- dehydration from diarrhea. Our arsenal is now well- stocked with new technologies and rediscovered practices that can be similarly put to scale with inspired leadership and modest additional financial resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if we continue to turn our backs on the plight of the poor, or ask them to wait patiently for better days, we will reap a whirlwind for all humankind -- a political, economic and environmental whirlwind that will shake even the prosperous and long-time democracies to their foundations and condemn us to a new international order of permanent conflict and instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What can the United States do, right away, to help lead the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">way? Many things, but I will list a few thoughts:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Few actions would have more immediate impact or symbolic weight than the president's signing of the historic &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; for the world's young -- the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The United States' national program of action to implement commitments made at the 1990 World Summit for Children (outlined in a plan issued in November), which apply to children of developing and industrial countries alike, could provide a useful base for initiating bipartisan actions (for a) much-needed reordering of priorities for children, women and families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * We need (to support) the call issued two years ago by the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">United Nations Development Program: first, for developing countries to devote at least 20 percent of their budgets to directly meeting the priority human needs of their people; and second, for 20 percent of all international aid for development to directly support those priority areas of human need -- primary health care, nutrition, basic education, family planning, and safe water and sanitation. (Today, only about ten percent of domestic spending in poor countries and of overseas aid is devoted to such investments.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The new spirit of democratic change and economic reform moving in Africa today simply cannot long survive the financial hemorrhage of paying an average $1 billion in debt service to foreign creditors every month for over a decade. Here again, the United States could help lead the way to a solution to the African crisis. Why not have this summer's G-7 Summit (the meeting of the seven most-industrialized nations) definitively address African debt, with much of the local currency proceeds going to accelerate programs for children, women and the environment?  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To renew my fond acquaintance with an area I had lived in for nearly seven years, I recently set out with my family on a drive from Cote d'Ivoire (formerly called the Ivory Coast) across Togo and back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are few experiences that offer as accurate a barometer of African life as a long road trip these days, and our jaunt fully lived up to our expectations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is one thing to read from afar about the transformation of a region from plodding and paternalistic authoritarianism to dynamic, if still uncertain, democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is quite another to see what only recently would have been unimaginable changes firsthand and yet to realize that so much more must be done before any of the countries of the region can be said to have laid a solid foundation for its future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abidjan, the glittering economic capital of Cote d'Ivoire, has</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">always captured the contradictions of the region: a fast-paced and modern metropolis in a country whose economy rests on the antiquated pillars of coffee and cocoa. With its ever-spreading network of expressways and overpasses, the city appears to defy the country's stark economic crisis. It remains something of a consumerist boom town in a country where villagers are still more than likely to be illiterate and without access to even basic modern health care.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These days, the Pearl of the Lagoons, as Abidjan is called in tourist brochures has added another contradiction. There are few places on the continent where democracy is discussed with as much openness and vigor as here, and yet all of the hoopla seems to end abruptly at the gates of the city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maybe this is because the opposition newspapers that have sprung up like wild mushrooms have never really penetrated the rural world, where reading and the disposable income that helps create the newspaper habit are, if not rare, still marks of distinction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government, cleverly, has been much slower in relinquishing control over the airwaves, knowing that news transmitted orally is by far the most readily accessible. If Abidjan is the effervescent center of political contention, le pays profond, still belongs, by mostly dexterous coercion, to Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the aging president who sometimes likes to be called the country's &quot;First Peasant,&quot; to signal his attachment to the rural world and it to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It isn't necessary to travel very far past Port-Bouet, at the edge of the city, to see that, beyond this fondness, what helps to hold the &quot;deep country&quot; in check is a system of almost feudal control over the lives of the peasants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whereas Abidjanais are now freer than ever to denounce, to complain, to critique and to challenge, the peasantry are subject to the near-absolute law of petty officials, from prefect to soldier to gendarme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The road to Ghana, like roads in every region of the country, are cluttered with roadblocks where, under pretense of halting illegal immigration and looking for wanted criminals, officials have perfected an arbitrary tax system whose purpose is only to fill their pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Corn or cassava, musical cassettes or cement, whatever the cargo, the official exacts his cut.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These men have made our life impossible, &quot;said Manzan, a 30-ish woman we passed going the other way as she returned from a bus trip to Nigeria to buy trading goods. &quot;They have no heart for anyone but their own families.  Face to face, they will tell me that how we feed ours is not their problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The trader, whose impressive entrepreneurship is the kind that -- constructively harnessed -- would make this region truly blossom, had just been levied half of her varied cargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We had our first personal run-in with this highway robbery at the frontier with Ghana. The Ivorian side, once a model of order in keeping with the country's official image of itself -- more modern, better structured, more French than its neighbors -- now is a picture of larcenous chaos.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amid a cacophony of traders with their tins and small trays of wares, women with large cloth bundles of food and secreted goods, fixers who promised an easy crossing and police agents on the prowl for a good take (occasionally raising a whip to subdue the pressing crowds), we tried to stick to the letter of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After presenting all of our papers, both personal and those for our borrowed vehicle, the red-eyed agent looked incredulous. &quot;What? No bribe?&quot; his expression seemed to say. An older policeman, a veteran of these things whispered in my ear to &quot;make a gesture.&quot; I feigned not to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this incomprehension, we were not allowed passage until the next morning, when a fresh set of guards were manning the crossing, their nerves still unjangled by the heat and the din.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the old days in this region, for me, anyway, crossing into Ghana from anywhere used to be considered one of the more arduous travel experiences. The muddle that infects the Ivorian side these days was typical of the Ghanaian side of the border on good days back then.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I like to imagine that the changes at the border in Ghana, where the proceedings had an almost otherworldly orderliness to them during our crossings, reflect the growing confidence of a country that is emerging from a long schizophrenic nightmare of alternating rounds of dictatorship and anarchy, which sometimes coincided. Ghana seems finally on the brink to fulfilling some of its considerable potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is less strident talk of democracy in Ghana than in its showier neighbor, Cote d'Ivoire. One gets a feeling, instead, of a more mature realization of both the costs and benefits of the individual responsibility that a functioning democracy implies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the border crossing at Elubo, Mike Oppong, a veteran immigration officer spoke with pride of the way things are being straightened out in his administration. Asked if this meant that agents made less money in the past, when rules were invented on</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the fly and bribery was brazenly open, he said: &quot;We can live with our earnings better now because we have a clearer conscience. This is the only way Ghana will ever go forward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All is not roses yet in Ghana, to be sure. In Noe, a sea- hugging village that lives from fishing and the harvesting of its graceful oil palms, a man in his mid 50s has recently returned, disillusioned from a lengthy career of journalism in the capital, to farm and to teach.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What we practice in this country cannot yet be called journalism,&quot; said the farmer, who asked that his name not be used. &quot;If you write what a politician said and he doesn't like it, he will deny he said it. If you contradict him in print, then you have problems. This is not yet what I would call freedom.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Down the road a ways, under a darkening sky and a shared meal of smoked fish and fried yams, a young engineer, sharp of mind, speaks wryly of the frustrations of trying to find decent work in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I cannot start a family now, although I am at an age where I would like to do so, &quot; he says. &quot;Jerry Rawlings (the Ghanaian president) has done a lot to lift the country up, but for ordinary people, life has only gotten harder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everywhere, in fact, as Ghana puts in new roads to replace the seemingly battle-scarred highways of old, and erects modern buildings to crowd out the colonial vintage architecture that still</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">dominates most towns, the story has this ring to it: yes, things have gotten better, but life has not gotten easier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana represent contrasting economic examples -- the first easing its way down from its once haughty plateau of imagined affluence, the other searching for a formula to continue its recent rise -- both are struggling with new democratic realities. But on the other side of Ghana, Togo stands, along with Liberia, as an example of the West African version of a descent into hell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having our small children along was not a cause for parental concern in most of the places we went, but to drive through Togo today is to run a gauntlet of nightmares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of last year's violent suppression of a civilian administration by the army, in a struggle between military rule and a pro-democracy movement, there is little functioning government left. Little Togo, once considered by many to be one of the most charming countries on the continent, has become one of the most brutal and unpredictable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Every few miles, at a rhythm far exceeding anything I've seen elsewhere since the last days of the notorious dictator Milton Obote in Uganda, anyone on the road is subject to a roadblock check that often amounts to armed holdup.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The border crossing between Ghana and the Togolese capital of Lome has a fevered buzz to it, the kind of nervous bustling feeling of a place where people are frantically stocking goods for an impending catastrophe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nothing particular was going on in the country while we were there, except the everyday anxieties that keep the streets mostly empty by day and completely barren by night.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We chose not to stop in Lome, a city I used to look forward to having an excuse to visit. Instead, we continued across Togo, figuring that on the way back we would take a route through the country's rural midlands. The idea was that by avoiding the ambient ill-ease of the capital, we could reduce the anxieties of the journey.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were wrong. The way back was tortured and harrowing. The armed groups we encountered on the road, alternately pro- and anti- &quot;government,&quot; were often drunk and almost always abusive. On several occasions, guns were pointed menacingly, bags ripped open and threats made. Only a practiced nonchalance, an understated compliance and, perhaps most importantly, the surprisingly good grace and humor of my wife and children got us through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Toward the end of a day-long drive, however, as we neared the Ghana border in the cool mountainous hills west of Kpalime, the trying experience was capped by car failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With a night sky descending on us and a broken car stuck on an isolated mountain road, I silently prepared my mind for the worst.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, in the kind of experience I have had over and over again that each time strengthens my faith in the people of the continent, a carload of men who were going the other direction finally showed up just at dark. They stopped, inquired about our difficulty, and took it upon themselves to go find the needed parts and then returned to help us fix the car and be on our way.  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AfricaNews: Global Exchange runs tours with a difference. It's not an ordinary travel agency, but it also isn't alone in the field, is it? It's part of a growing phenomenon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: There is a movement. It's usually referred to as socially responsible tourism. There's a whole branch that focuses on environmental tourism. It all comes out of '60s and '70s people who grew up and got educated, and we started traveling around and realized that other cultures have so much to teach us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Do you have a point of view -- a world view, if you will -- that you're trying to promote?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: What we say to our people is, &quot;Look, we don't have a dogma or an agenda that we want to convince you of. We just want to expose you and open you up to this experience and see how it affects you. Just be open minded, and we're so convinced that it will affect you that we don't have to ram it down your throat.&quot; We don't try to avoid unpleasantness or controversy or differing opinions among the people we meet on our trips. We have confidence in our own people's basic wisdom. I think one of the problems with mainstream education and the mass media is that it's overly filtered, and people are not exposed to a broad enough range of what's out there. So we try to immerse the members of our tours in all the complexity and rely on their innate wisdom to be able to sort it out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: Describe your reality tours to Africa. What are they, what happens on them and what sort of people go?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: We try to do broad outreach, and we include in that a scholarship fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're particularly interested in sending African Americans, community organizers and people who are going to use the experience well when they come home. We give them a good orientation so they know what to expect when they get there. And then on the trip, we're focused less on your standard tourism of seeing the sites -- the big waterfalls and the animals and that kind of Tarzan image of Africa -- and more on introducing people to the community groups, to the grass-roots organizations that we think</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">are the future of Africa: the women's groups, the community development organizations, the peasant organizations that are really transforming the face of Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What do you mean when you say you want to take people who will use the experience well when they come back home, and how do you encourage that process?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: We provide them with suggestions, based on our own experiences and the experiences of other people who have traveled and come back and done public education. We give them a list of ways in which they can share what they've learned. It's very effective if you've just come back from a trip to Senegal or South Africa and you see an article in the newspaper, to write a letter to the editor and say, &quot;Well, I was just there, and I can tell you that what I saw did or did not match up with what was in your article.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, there are plenty of schools, colleges and radio stations around the country constantly looking for speakers with direct experience of the countries in question. So we try to give some ideas of how to address public audiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, we try to share ideas about fund raising because one of the problems with doing nonprofit work, educational work, is where to find the money. For example, there is an inner-city high-school group in Seattle that takes 30 or 40 students to East Africa each summer. They fund it basically in one weekend of fund-raising activity. Each student gets a sponsor and the students gather one weekend and clean up the shoreline of Lake Washington. So they make the linkage between environmental cleanup work here in the United States -- which is something pretty much everybody can support -- and, on the other hand, something on the other side of the planet going on in Africa.  These students really get changed by the experience of not just going to Africa, but of earning their own way.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: All these things sound wonderful, but what's wrong with just going to see beautiful waterfalls or rare animals?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: Well, I'm a nature lover myself, so there is a part of me that says, &quot;Yeah, there's nothing wrong with going to see a waterfall and animals.&quot; And on our trips, we always make time for people to go off and do &quot;touristy&quot; things. But given the emergency situation in Africa, and given the ability of the United States to do something about it, and given our responsibility for the cold war manipulations that supported dictators and prevented democracy in so many countries, I think we really owe it to the African people to do a little pay-back work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We're not suggesting taking the load of Africa on our backs, but just educating Americans so they understand what's going on; so they understand why you have anarchy in a country like Somalia or Zaire and how it's related to the history of U.S. foreign policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think one thing good that we've seen about our reality tours is that once people go to Africa and meet Africans, and have sat down with them and shared meals with them, then it's very difficult to ignore the news reports about starving children and crisis and emergency. The experience pushes them in the direction of taking some responsibility for what's going on. Not responsibility for what Africans need to fix, but for what we need to fix in terms of our institutions and their involvement in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: What do your folks come back from their experiences thinking that Americans can do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: Well, you get a broad range of reactions when people come back. For example, we had a minister on one of our trips. She came back and immediately got involved with her church, and with the larger associations that her church was part of, to try to educate them about what was going on in Africa. She had come across a lot of really good groups that wanted to have some kind of formal linkage with groups in the United States for ongoing activity. She pursued those quite successfully.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think one of the problems is that we focus too much on government policy. It's good to try to change U.S. government policy, but I think we also need to work in schools and churches and professional associations and trade unions -- the organizations that are out here in each of our communities, where we can have a more direct impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That's one of the things that we at Global Exchange call</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;grass-roots internationalism&quot;: trying to promote the direct linking of community-based organizations in Africa with community-based organizations in the U.S. -- a sister school or a sister church or some other kind of linkage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: When you take people on reality tours, how does it affect the widespread perception of Americans that Africa is nothing but a disaster area?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: We try to ensure that people get a range of experience. On one trip to Mozambique, we visited a refugee transit center that was one of the most heartbreaking experiences you could ever imagine. There were people who were literally holding their children and watching them die from hunger and hunger- related diseases, because their homes had been attacked by guerrillas supported by South Africa. Leaving that place on the bus, the entire group was absolutely silent. We were struck dumb by the horror of it all.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within a few days we were at a cooperative on the outskirts of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. Before we even get off the bus, a group of singing and dancing women come out, take us into their co-op, show us lush fields that they have constructed out of nothing, buildings they have built, pig production operations they have set up, all sorts of educational projects going on. Things that they have done largely on their own -- with some foreign assistance and some guidance from non-governmental agencies but largely through their own efforts. Our group came away from that saying, &quot;Wow! These people, given a chance, can make it. They can get organized and change their reality.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So I think visiting Americans need to realize that Africa is just as complex as the United States or any other society. Africa has everything from the horrible to the wonderful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Western definition of development has always been that the quantity of things you have determines how high you are on the development ladder. You spend time in Africa, and you realize that development should not be measured in the quantity of things but in the quality of social relations.  So people who get to know Africans and African communities learn that there are a lot of ways in which African cultures are more advanced than ours. They have things that we don't have, things that we've lost or that have been destroyed, that we need to regain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AN: So do people come back from reality tours hopeful about Africa's future?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Danaher: I think they come back with very mixed emotions. On all of our tours, wherever we go, we always have a debriefing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">session where we ask people specific questions: What was your greatest insight? What was your high point? What was your low point? What are you going to do to spread the messages that you've learned when you get back to the United States?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People say, &quot;I was heartbroken and I was distressed, but I came away hopeful for the future because I saw people in conditions of great destitution still managing to hold their head up.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you meet people who don't have shoes, they're so poor, and yet they stand up straight and they look you in the eye and they speak with dignity, you get Americans to realize it's not about what you own, it's about what you possess inside you. Most Americans know people in this country who own quite a lot of things but have lost their self-respect and dignity and, in fact, are very poor people. So it's good to force people to ask basic questions about what it really means to be a human being? What is the definition of development? And where are we going here in the United States?  n</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For three decades, East/West rivalry fed warfare in Angola. During the colonial era, independence movements received backing from the Soviet Union and China, while Portugal remained allied with the West. Since independence in 1975, the United States and the Soviet Union lined up on opposite sides, providing the warring parties with sophisticated weaponry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A peace pact signed in 1991 barred any further lethal support from the two superpowers and from South Africa, which has played an active military role in Angola since 1975. The accord led to elections in Angola last September, but disagreement over the results has plunged the country back into conflict. In one of the largest battles ever waged in Angola, government troops last month were forced to withdraw from Huambo, Angola's second largest city and headquarters for the opposition movement Unita. An estimated 15,000 people died during the battle, and thousands are now suffering from starvation and disease, unreachable by relief efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angolan government, formerly backed by the Soviet Union and Cuba, says its adversary, Unita, is up to old tricks. A massive resupply operation is being staged from South Africa, the government claims. South Africa was Unita's largest supporter during the civil war, although U.S. covert assistance totaling over $300 million from 1985 to 1991 was a critical element in Unita's ability to wage effective war.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita and South Africa deny the accusations, and Unita says it is the government that is employing South African mercenaries. The government-controlled oil company, Sonangol, has hired 100 former members of the South African military to protect oil installations from Unita attacks.  Those soldiers reportedly played a key role in the recapture by government forces of the oil-producing town of Soyo early last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the head of the South African security operation has denied his men are mercenaries, as they have been portrayed in the South African press.  &quot;It is totally untrue,&quot; Buks Buys said in an interview with Namibian television. &quot;We have been hired by a legitimate oil company.&quot; Buys said he was dismayed by the actions of Unita forces in Soyo, who he accused of brutality against the civilian population. &quot;This is not the Unita I knew,&quot; he said. &quot;These are bandits.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unita leader Jonas Savimbi, who rejected the results of the September voting as fraudulent, has now agreed to return to United Nations-sponsored peace talks. But no cease-fire has been agreed, and more fighting is expected. Unita has weapons and other materiel left over from the earlier phase of the war, but the movement needs fuel and other supplies to maintain its fighting strength.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An investigation by the British newspaper, the Guardian, has turned up clues that support the allegations that Unita's lifeline, once again, comes from the south.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three white South African mercenaries, wounded while fighting for Unita in Huambo, were flown out of Angola last month to a private clinic in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, south of Angola. From Windhoek, they were airlifted secretly to South Africa, according to officials in Angola and Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new evidence of South African involvement in the symbolic centerpiece battle of the Angolan war confirms reports from Angolan military sources of a vast resupply and logistics support to Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three men were part of a 100-strong force of former South African soldiers who were recruited by a security consultant in Pretoria, South Africa, to guards oil installations in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eeben Barlow, of Executive Outcomes, who organized the operation, confirmed in an interview that the men were part of his group. But he insisted that they were security guards, not mercenaries. However, senior Angolan sources said the men were picked up south of Huambo, hundreds of miles from the Angolan oil fields.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war now threatens to spill over into a new theater where South African involvement would be even more embarrassing. Unita leader Jonas Savimbi has threatened to attack two dams on the southern border, striking a severe economic blow against Namibia, which won independence from South African rule in 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Angolan government says the mercenaries fighting for Unita in Angola are former members of South African units that fought in Angola during the 1980s and were officially demobilized earlier this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The three wounded men -- Nico Bosman, Hermanus Ferreira and Geoffrey Landsberg, accompanied by a South African doctor -- were flown out of Angola through Zaire in a plane that has been used recently on illegal night flights into Angola. The clinic where the three men were kept, Westair, the company that owns the plane, and Propilot, the company that leased it, all share the same lawyer, according to officials in Namibia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Exemplary of the complex, sometimes contradictory relationships in the Angolan conflict is that Westair has made flights into Angola for the United Nations, and Propilot ferried the South African security attachment to Soyo for the government oil company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An interlocking network of small companies that can be traced back to the Johannesburg-based SA Bias group has been acting as contractor for buying strategic relief supplies and airlifting them into Unita territory. This business group has defense industry connections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A seven-year-old German relief agency, called Hilfe in Not, which has been active in Unita support activity, has mounted a public fundraising drive for Angola. After last year's elections, the agency produced a minority report for the German government, one of its funders, which rejected the view of the United Nations and other international observers that the voting was generally free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The German agency forms part of an extensive network of right-wing organizations linked to the South African government. A key part of the network has been a company called Strategy Network International, set up in the 1980s by Sean Cleary, a former South African diplomat who once served in Washington. Cleary's group spearheaded the 1989 election campaign in Namibia for pro- South African politicians running against the Namibian independence movement, Swapo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Subsequent investigations in South Africa have revealed that the anti-Swapo effort was the first part of &quot;Operation Agree,&quot; a complex secret strategy by South African military intelligence designed to preserve South African economic dominance of the southern African region. Support for Unita in Angola's elections was the second phase of &quot;Operation Agree,&quot; according to a former intelligence officer, Nico Basson, who gave extensive testimony during the investigation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dietrich Kantel, head of Hilfe in Not, says his group is not involved in military backing and is supplying only humanitarian relief. He says an estimated 500,000 people in Cuando Cubango -- the heart of Unita territory -- are in danger of starvation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From October to mid-February, Hilfe in Not has been sending freelance airlifts into southern Angola from the Namibian capital, Windhoek, using a private operator, Namibian Commercial Aviation. But the Angolan government asked the Namibian government to stop the flights because of suspicions that they are being used to ferry military equipment. Hilfe in Not's Kantel says that he is now using a contracting firm in the Zimbabwe capital to buy and ship corn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chris Schutte, the head of Namibian Commercial Aviation,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said in an interview: &quot;The Angolans thought we were flying in weapons.  That's all propaganda. We had an 18-month contract starting last April through Hilfe in Not, which we were trying to fulfill. We were taking in maize and seeds before the harvests.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana all have complained of violations of their airspace by planes flying into Angola from South Africa. South African Foreign Minister Roelof 'Pik' Botha has denied the allegations repeatedly, but South African Foreign Ministry sources have conceded that covert cargoes of food, medical supplies, fuel and weapons were &quot;more than likely&quot; finding their way to Unita.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the airports that South African officials acknowledge is not adequately secured to prevent unauthorized flights is Wonderboom, near Pretoria. The charter company Wonder Air has been named by the Angolan government as having flown supplies to Unita from Wonderboom on a nightly basis throughout November and December.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A South African connection with Schutte's company in Namibia has emerged from an invoice for a shipment of unidentified goods ferried by Namibian Commercial Aviation last December from Agra Mills, a white-run farming cooperative in northern Namibia, to the Angolan border town of Macusso.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The invoice shows that the contractor was Merchant International Trading, Inc. (MITI) of London. Company records show MITI shares offices, directors and shareholders with six other British-registered companies. A spokesman for MITI, who refused to give his name, confirmed that the companies were related. The principal one is Merchant Trade Finance, an investment arm of SA Bias, the South African conglomerate involved in the Unita relief operation. Christopher Seabrooke, who heads SA Bias, confirmed that his company has done business with Hilfe in Not.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A dozen experts have been meeting this month in Geneva, the nerve center of last year's Earth Summit preparations. The aim of the meeting, like all those who are organizing follow-up strategies and actions inspired by the summit, is vast. The group means to stop the spread of the world's deserts -- if not literally by holding back the sands, then by setting out the policy alternatives that would enable governments to cope with the problems of poverty that desertification brings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the few hundred inhabitants of Gidan Kaura, in the northern Nigerian state of Sokoto, the attention will be welcome. Six years ago they had to leave their homeland when the sands of the Sahara swept remorselessly into their houses. The Sokoto Environmental Protection Agency says that the Nigerian desert is advancing three miles (about five kilometers) a year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first problems negotiators must face is that scientists are split about whether deserts are advancing at all. Ulf Helden and other researchers at the University of Lund in Sweden have examined thousands of satellite photographs which show, they say, that the desert is merely changing shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The man who will try to bridge the two viewpoints is also a Swede. Bo Kjellen, a diplomat who took part in the Earth Summit negotiations, was pitted against Helden in a debate in Lund last month. In the confrontation, he forced Helden to agree that scientific controversies about long-term geo-climatic trends are irrelevant to people facing famine. But Kjellen is not hopeful that the experts in Geneva will come up with much in the way of minimum agreements. He thinks that the most that can be expected from the sessions is that the planners will be in a position to offer government negotiators realistic options when world officials meet in Nairobi, Kenya, in May to start detailed work on a global environmental treaty. The United Nations wants a document ready for signing in Paris in June 1994.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are talking about the problems of land management for 900 million people,&quot; Kjellen says. &quot;There are clear relationships between development and environment, with poverty right at the center.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the challenges, environmentalists say, is that poverty is more than a scientific issue that can be solved with new laboratory-designed programs. The issue of how to eradicate poverty extends to the question of who has control over land and financial resources. In many parts of Africa, for instance, most agricultural work is done by women, but government extension services, practical assistance and technical cooperation money is dispensed to men.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A second chance. This is not the first time the UN has tried to tackle the world's deserts. In 1977 it adopted a &quot;plan of action&quot; to stop desertification. After 15 years, the effort is acknowledged as a complete failure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nairobi-based UN Environment Programme (Unep) says the plan failed because it tried to apply technical solutions to socio-economic and socio-political problems, it did not include local populations in drawing up solutions, and it failed to integrate environmental programs into other development strategies. Unep also cites the low priority given to desert areas by funding agencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the global problems of land degradation and the dwindling of water supplies is worsening rapidly in Africa. Swedish hydrologist Malin Falkenmark, who is on Unep's scientific and technical advisory panel, says that one country, Tunisia, is now</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">beyond what she calls the &quot;water barrier&quot;: it has less than the bare minimum of 500 cubic meters of water per person per year. By the end of the century, Falkenmark predicts, 11 African countries with a total population of 250 million people will share that status, and by 2025 the number of countries with water emergencies could rise to 1.1 billion people -- two-thirds of the continent's projected population. Already the movement of deserts threatens four-fifths of sub-Saharan Africa's dry lands and range lands -- about 5.8 million square miles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UN convention on desertification will try to tackle the fundamental causes of dwindling water supplies, such as the loss of plant cover, which means that less water is released into the atmosphere, reducing the chance of rain. The barren lands also reflect sunlight, heating up the atmosphere and dispersing rain clouds that do form. Dust storms may exacerbate this effect by causing sunlight to be reflected even more harshly off clouds of dust into the sky.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the puzzle of how plant cover is lost has spawned another controversy. There are three theories about which is the major cause -- long-term global warming, short-term drought and human activity -- although everyone agrees that the answer is some combination of the three.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The debate over whether the planet is warming will not be settled by the experts meeting in Geneva, although their colleagues who are working on the Climate Change Convention that was signed in Rio have their own special panel to look at desertification. Short-term drought is an accepted fact of African life, however, and Saharan and other African herders have adapted to the phenomenon by developing a nomadic lifestyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The impact of human activity is more complicated to assess.  Governments often accuse poor people who live on the margins of deserts of destroying their land by cutting down the area's last few trees for fuel.  Others say the real problem is inappropriate government development plans that have forced poor people into situations where they have no options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political support needed. Experts are aware that the proposed Convention will not be enough, in itself, to halt desert</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">advance: Even if the proposed pact offers incentives for governments, it would be unlikely to offer direct benefits for many people in the Sahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the Tuareg people who have led a nomadic life for centuries on marginal lands of Africa's Sahel region are now fighting for survival in the countries that were created by colonization -- Algeria, Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali and Niger. Many of the traditional grazing lands have been taken over for use in externally funded development projects, which plant the areas in crops like peanuts for export to European markets. As a result, nomads have been forced further into the desert itself. And bad farming techniques, which too often characterize the projects, slowly are destroying the old lands, turning them, too, into desert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kjellen says that the attempt to create a global coalition to tackle the problem of encroaching deserts is important in itself, but that it also could pave the way for cooperation on a whole range of issues important to every country's well being. &quot;I see the effort as a genuine partnership,&quot; he says. &quot;If, in doing this, African countries get the feeling that the international community is more responsive to their particular problems, it could have an impact on some other matters in the future. My reading of the African attitudes in the negotiations in Rio was that the question of desertification took on a symbolic value for them.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FIRST VISIT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria last month became the first African nation to send a top-level delegation on an official visit to Washington since President Clinton took office. &quot;It's appropriate for the first one to be from the continent's most populous country,&quot; said a senior State Department official after talks last month with the head of Nigeria's transitional council, Ernest E.A. Shonekan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A prominent lawyer and business executive, Shonekan was tapped late last year to head a ruling interim administration, which will serve until an elected president is inaugurated in August. Shonekan, leading an entourage, which included the ministers of foreign affairs and petroleum and the attorney general, had meetings with Vice President Al Gore, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Deputy Secretary of State Clifford Wharton.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the discussions, Shonekan briefed American officials on Nigeria's election process. He also emphasized the need for relief from the substantial debt burden the civilian administration will inherit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> QUICK SWITCH</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Bill Clinton, in a statement last week, said that J. Brian Atwood -- who was nominated earlier as undersecretary of State for management -- instead has been tapped to head the Agency for International Development (AID). Atwood, who has been on the job at State pending his confirmation, will give the Clinton administration a trusted ally at the aid agency.  Clinton's announcement said that Atwood's &quot;proven effectiveness and his commitment to democratic change make him an ideal choice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been intense jockeying for position among potential candidates for the AID job, a level of interest that is reported to have surprised Clinton. In recent weeks, members of Congress have expressed frustration at the delay in appointing a leader for the agency, which is expected to figure prominently in the debate over foreign aid in the post-Cold War world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Atwood, who was an influential member of the Clinton transition team, has been president of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs since 1985. He served in the State Department under Cyrus Vance and Edmund Muskie, was a dean at the Foreign Service Institute, and has been a foreign service officer, including a stint at the American Embassy in Cote d'Ivoire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SCREENING</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A feature film by Zimbabwe director Godwin Mawuru is in Washington, DC, for a one-week run at the Biograph Theatre beginning April 9. Called &quot;Neria,&quot; the movie is a project of the Media for Development Trust. Before final editing, the film, made in Zimbabwe with a local cast, was screened in several African countries to judge audience reaction. Filmmakers say they wanted to see if the picture's strong women's rights message got through to the public. Director Mawuru says the theme is one that is close to his heart because his father died when he was a child, and laws that refused to recognize womens' inheritance rights left the family destitute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recent years, Mawuru's country has become a popular site for shooting films. The current Disney movie, &quot;A Far Off Place,&quot; was made on location in Zimbabwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TRAILBLAZER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A woman from the West African nation of Sierra Leone has become the first United Methodist cleric outside the United States to be given the status of chaplain by the denomination's Division of Chaplains and Related Ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Rev. Muriel Alice Fitzjohn, who also is married to a United Methodist minister, is an educator and former youth worker who serves as a chaplain in health care facilities. Fitzjohn, who is 67, is thought to be the oldest woman to receive the chaplaincy endorsement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> AFRICA MAKES NEWS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A book on media images of Africa has won the 1992 Sigma Delta Chi award from the Society of Professional Journalists. Africa's Media Image, edited by Beverly Hawk and published by Greenwood Publishing Group, was honored for its &quot;important contribution to research on American journalism.&quot; The judges said that Hawk's work in compiling the &quot;wide-ranging collection of essays&quot; illuminated the debate on media coverage of Africa and the effects of coverage on American views of the continent. (Africa News Service Executive Editor Tami Hultman contributed a chapter to the book.) </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The journalism society, which has 16,000 members, has presented annual Sigma Delta Chi awards since 1932.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SISTERHOOD IS POWERFUL</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women representing over 25 organizations in the United States have signed a letter of support for the South African Women's Charter. The gesture, coordinated by the New York-based Africa Fund, follows the launch on March 8 of the Women's Charter Campaign -- an effort to ensure that the issue of rights for women be injected into debates on a new South African constitution and bill of rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the support letter's signers are Colorado congresswoman Patricia Schroeder; National Organization for Women President Patricia Ireland; Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of Negro Women; Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women; and Joan B.  Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches USA. The National Council of Jewish Women signed as a group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charter campaign is being waged by the Women's National Coalition, a group that draws from over 50 South African organizations including political parties, church groups, business and professional organizations, and non-governmental organizations. The coalition is thought to be the most broadly based organization working in South Africa today. In addition to the 50 national organizations the campaign members represent, the effort has drawn support from hundreds of local and regional groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the campaign's program is multifaceted, its slogan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">is simple: South Africa will not be free until its women are free.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hussain Ibrahim is a livestock exporter who has lived in this dusty port city for nearly 20 years. After surviving the near total destruction of the bloody civil war, he is struggling to restart his business and resume sales of sheep, goats and cattle to nearby countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Berbera, where temperatures sometimes climb to 135 degrees Fahrenheit, was once a centerpiece in the hot East/West competition for this region of the world. The Soviet Union built a naval facility here, which the United States took over when the two superpowers swapped client states in the late 1970s.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The town is roofless,&quot; Ibrahim observes, looking out across the low, brown buildings that make up the area around the docks. Tin and almost anything else that was removable were looted during intense fighting against the dictatorship of Mohammed Siad Barre, who finally was ousted in late 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It hasn't been easy -- none of us here are rich, and we're all working hard to earn a living,&quot; says Ibrahim. &quot;But we're doing a lot better than those people in the south.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During 1990, the north of Somalia declared independence from the rest of the country and assumed the name Somaliland. An assembly of political and clan leaders set up an interim government, headed by Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tour, a leader of the campaign against Siad Barre. The fighting ended, and the territory escaped the ravages of war and clan fighting that has brought such destruction to the south, where an American-led intervention force has mounted a massive relief operation to save thousands of starving people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace and Food Exports. Throughout Somaliland, popular support for independence seems widespread. The mood is optimistic. In Berbera and in Hargeisa, the capital, one can walk peacefully through kiosk-lined streets where vendors sell all manner of merchandise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Agricultural and livestock production are in evidence. This year, Somaliland has grown sufficient rice, sorghum and wheat to export to neighboring Djibouti and Saudi Arabia. Meat is being sold to Yemen and Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somaliland was not made as destitute by war and drought as was Somalia, says Mark Stirling, regional representative for Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund. A &quot;semblance of social order&quot; was retained, and agricultural reserves were not totally depleted in the north as they have been in the south, Stirling says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People in both regions have been plagued by long-term poverty. Life expectancy was only about 47 years and literacy about 40 percent even before the war began. During the Siad Barre years, the ratio of government spending on military compared to social needs was a staggering 500-to-one.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somaliland still feels the burdens of those military outlays.  According to Interior Minister Saeed Mohamed Noor, some one million land mines were planted during Siad Barre's rule. Gen. Mohammed Siad Morgan, one of the warlords causing difficulties in the south, was military governor of the north when most of the mines were laid, Noor says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somaliland has its own ethnic rivalries and regional tensions, which the interim government is trying to resolve. Representatives from all clans have been meeting recently to draft a formal constitution and lay the groundwork for elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Development Aid, Not Relief. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) is assisting with the development of an agricultural plan that is compatible with local needs and resources. To promote efficient cultivation of fields for crops, the FAO this month imported 200 head of cattle for sale to merchants who, in turn, will sell them to farmers. Cows are a cheap alternative to tractors and don't require tough-to-find spare parts, UN officials say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Care International is coordinating a food program designed to strengthen rather than compete with the local economy. Food is being sold on the open market -- not distributed for free -- in an effort to create a stable market price and combat inflation. &quot;A goat, which traded for 60 kilograms (132 pounds) of wheat 18 months ago, now sells for 40 kilograms (88 pounds),&quot; says John Buttery of Save the Children, United Kingdom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the progress, the interim government is still struggling to assert its authority and establish an economic program. Riots broke out last year in Berbera when authorities tried to collect taxes needed to finance government activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government backed down, and merchants seem intent on resisting any further taxation effort. &quot;I see no reason to give money that was hard-won by me,&quot; says Hussain Ibrahim. &quot;If I must fight over this, I will. God willing, I will win.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the end of March, police opened fire on political opposition marchers in the city of Bamenda, killing two people and wounding at least 27 others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shootings came just two days after the Cameroon government announced &quot;a grand debate&quot; on constitutional reform, a key opposition demand.  The demonstration was the second of three weekly protest marches called by opposition leader, Ni John Fru Ndi, to protest &quot;the people's stolen victory of October 11.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fru Ndi is the chairman of the Bamenda-based Social Democratic Front party and head of a coalition -- the Union for Change -- that is attempting to pressure the government of President Paul Biya to hold new presidential elections under international supervision.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A bookseller from Bamenda, Fru Ndi maintains he won the October 11 presidential election, but that Biya supporters manipulated the vote totals to give the victory to Biya. Official government figures give Biya 39 percent of the 3 million votes cast and Fru Ndi second place with 36 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government scheduled the balloting after a two-year campaign by a growing pro-democracy movement, which called strikes and stay-at-homes that left streets and businesses deserted for weeks at a time in many cities and towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Eyewitness accounts of the recent shootings indicate that police opened fire after a crowd -- estimated by opposition sources as 10,000 strong -- sat down on one of the main city streets and refused to move after police barred their route. Observers say police used tear gas and concussion hand grenades before firing with rifles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They (the police) were still firing on people as I was running away,&quot; says Anthony Venyena, who was in the front ranks of the marchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government officials in Bamenda reported the arrests of 20 women and 13 men following the march, but authorities say they will not discuss the circumstances of the shooting until after an investigation is completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to reports from marches in five other provincial capitals on the same day, police were less deadly in dealing with demonstrators. In Yaounde, police chased demonstrators round the downtown area with an armored, twin-nozzled water cannon. The scene suggested a bizarre image of an elephant chasing ants. In Bertoua, five people were reported arrested, while in Bafoussam, a heavy police presence prevented a large gathering from materializing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a statement released late the night of March 25 to the government-run Cameroon Radio, Prime Minister Simon Achidi Achu said the government would investigate the circumstances of the shootings, and that it &quot;condemns the acts of barbarism and those involved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The government again invites the population to be vigilant and confirms its determination to maintain order and peace within the spirit of respect for the freedom and rights of its citizens,&quot; the prime minister's statement said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement also pointed a finger at Fru Ndi followers, saying the shootings happened within &quot;a program of disorder initiated by certain political parties of the radical opposition.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The prime minister was referring to a two-part plan of action announced March 15 by Fru Ndi, which called for a boycott of all French-made goods and companies and a series of peaceful marches on three consecutive Thursdays, ending on April 1. The campaign, according to Fru Ndi, is to protest &quot;the recolonization of Cameroon by France, the savage destruction of our forests and environment, and the people's stolen victory of October 11, 1993.&quot; He said the opposition Union for Change would give the government until April 5 to make a satisfactory response, warning that the opposition would be forced into drastic action unless it gets some satisfaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two days before the violent Bamenda incident, Cameroon government spokesman and Minister of Communications Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni said during a televised press conference that the government would hold &quot;a grand debate&quot; on constitutional reform nationwide during April and May.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every Cameroonian and legal political party will have the opportunity to participate in the debate,&quot; Kontchou Kouomegni said, but he offered no specifics about how the country's 12 million people will be able to register their views.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those are small details,&quot; Kontchou Kouomegni told AfricaNews. &quot;The details of the organization will be published as soon as possible.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Paul Biya had promised a debate on a new constitution during the campaign. The Union for Change coalition has sought constitutional reform as the first step to a free and fair election, which the coalition contends the October 11 vote was not.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Kontchou has rejected the union's demand that the debate take the form of a &quot;national conference&quot; with a broad representation from civic and religious groups as well as political parties -- a mechanism used as a transition to democracy in several French-speaking African countries. Biya supporters fear such a conference would serve as a platform for the opposition to expose excesses of past and present members of government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Opposition sources say the government's announcement of a constitutional debate was too imprecise to merit a serious response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You cannot sort out exactly what they want to do,&quot; says Dorothee Kom, a Fru Ndi spokeswoman. &quot;There is no content, and nothing is said clearly.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Twenty-three years after Ntsu Mokhlehle won an election to be prime minister of Lesotho, he may finally have a chance to govern.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Mokhlehle's Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) was declared the winner of the first general election since 1970 in Lesotho (pronounced Lay soo' too), a Maryland-sized country completely surrounded by South Africa. Results showed the party winning all the country's 65 constituencies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The BCP swept the 1970 vote as well, but the ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) canceled the election, killed hundreds of opponents, declared a state of emergency, and outlawed the BCP and arrested its leaders. The repressive measures, backed by South Africa, were little noticed outside Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This election has been different. An international group of 130 election observers, coordinated by the United Nations, gave the poll a vote of confidence. &quot;We are satisfied that those who voted were able to freely and fairly exercise their views,&quot; said a statement by the Commonwealth Observer Group, one of 11 organizations and seven governments who participated in the observer mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That assessment has been disputed by the BNP, the only political party, other than the BCP, to put up a full field of candidates. The BNP ruled Lesotho with an iron fist until six years ago, when a military coup ousted BNP leader Leabua Jonathan, who died two years later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A BNP statement last week said the conduct of the balloting violated &quot;every tenet and every spirit of fairness and equity.&quot; The party complained that polling places had opened late and voting had extended into a second, unscheduled day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response, the observer team acknowledged some logistical problems and the extension of voting hours, but it said those realities did not reflect an attempt to rig the elections. &quot;International observers have not found grounds to believe that there have been fraudulent activities or public disorders that would have invalidated the outcome of these elections,&quot; the observers said in a statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although small in size, Lesotho is a nation of forbidding but majestic terrain and of isolated, hard-to-reach areas. Nicknamed &quot;the magic mountain kingdom,&quot; it is a place where, even in mid- summer, blizzards can block access to higher elevations. In remote mountain areas, some voters arrived at polling places on horseback or had to be given lifts by helicopters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fear and Hope. Because of Lesotho's troubled history, the BNP's refusal to accept the results stirred fears that the BCP might be denied its victory once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After Jonathan's overthrow, a succession of military leaders has exercised power. Beginning in 1990, the country's rulers have been promising a free vote, but there have been widespread suspicions about those intentions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The people of Lesotho appear to welcome this transition with wary enthusiasm,&quot; said a pre-election assessment by the Washington, DC-based International Republican Institute (IRI), which sent 13 observers. &quot;Many individuals, parties and organizations expressed strong concern -- not about the potential for fraud on election day, but about the post-election transition. No one wants a repeat of (the 1970) elections in which actual irregularities were reportedly few, but the election results were not respected by those who lost.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jim Dunlap, an IRI observer who spent more than four weeks in Lesotho, says that for the country's people, &quot;1970 is like yesterday. It's talked about all the time. The atmosphere now is compared to that in 1970, so naturally that makes people cautious.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Adding to the uncertainty was the fact that neither the election laws nor the text of a new constitution were released until ten days before the election. In addition, the constitutional document is vague about the role of the military in the new government. &quot;We are worried,&quot; says one Lesotho voter whose job takes him around the country, &quot;that the military will use the BNP's complaints to continue to wield effective power.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has been clear to knowledgeable observers that the BCP would win any truly fair vote. BCP leader Mokhlehle, who studied with Nelson Mandela and other South African anti-apartheid leaders, was a famed campaigner against British colonial rule, and his win in 1970 -- the country's first post-independence election -- was no surprise at the time. After fleeing the country in 1974, Mokhlehle campaigned from exile for Lesotho democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1979, when Lesotho authorities stepped up a terror campaign against opponents, Mokhlehle launched a guerrilla insurgency against the Jonathan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But internationally, the government held all the cards. After Jonathan began to criticize his powerful neighbor, South Africa, in 1977, foreign aid to Lesotho soared. Outside assistance rose still further when Lesotho blamed South Africa for the BCP's attacks. U.S. development assistance rose 13-fold from 1976 to 1980, not counting $34 million for food and road building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government was noticeably less successful, however, at persuading its own people that the threat came from abroad. A month-long reporting trip to every corner of Lesotho during 1980 confirmed Mokhlehle's claim that he had overwhelming support from the country's one million people. Even in the atmosphere of fear and intimidation that prevailed, it was difficult to find a critic of Mokhlehle outside the ruling elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, unlike 1970 or 1980, Lesotho is operating -- if not quite in the glare of international publicity -- at least in its dim glow. &quot;Lesotho has the potential for being a model for the region,&quot; says Jim Dunlap. &quot;It has the ability to give confidence about the transition process in other countries, including South Africa. We have every indication that things should go smoothly.&quot; As the strength of the BCP victory became known, a festival atmosphere began to spread in Maseru, the capital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In interviews since the vote, Ntsu Mokhlehle, long called a dangerous radical by opponents, has been making conciliatory statements, thanking the military for paving the way to free elections and promising to take all opinions into account as he tackles such issues as relations with South Africa and the role of the country's traditional monarchy. He has promised the country's people an honest, effective government but says hard work is needed from every citizen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 74-year-old BCP head, who retains the acute mind and magnetic personality that propelled him to leadership, also says he is optimistic.  &quot;I'm old,&quot; he says, &quot;but I've got energy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his victory speech, Mokhlehle said his administration will put into place &quot;practical steps toward solving hunger, disease, ignorance and joblessness.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Crystal ball gazing is a tricky exercise in any country, but particularly in South Africa, where 26 political parties begin meeting this week to hash out a process leading to elections. No firm dates or plans have been made, but based on the agreements to date between the African National Congress (ANC) and the National Party, AfricaNews has constructed this very tentative timetable for the countdown to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * April to June 1993: Twenty-six political parties meet in &quot;multiparty negotiations&quot; to establish a timetable for the process leading to elections. Major players are the National Party, the African National Congress (ANC), Inkatha, the Pan Africanist Party and the Conservative Party.  The governing National Party and Inkatha are pressing for these multiparty negotiations to reach binding agreements on issues such as how much power will be concentrated in the national government and how much power regional governments will have over economic, social and political issues. The ANC believes that the multiparty talks should only discuss the transition period, and that all binding decisions for the long term, including the powers of the regions, should be decided by the elected constituent assembly. Decisions will be made on the basis of &quot;sufficient consensus&quot; among all the parties.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * June to August 1993: The existing National Party- dominated parliament passes legislation to create a Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which will include representatives from all of the major political parties in the negotiations. The ANC insists that the TEC have executive control over the security forces, the media, finance/budget matters and the running of elections. The National Party says that the TEC should be advisory in nature and that the current parliament and F.W. de Klerk's cabinet should continue to rule the country during the interim period. Both parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">agree to establish:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * an independent electoral commission to organize and supervise the elections;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * an independent media commission to oversee the impartiality of the media.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * September to December 1993: Once the procedures for the elections and the functioning of the constituent assembly have been agreed upon, the present parliament will pass a new nonracial constitution for the interim administration of the country, providing for the elections and creation of a constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * January to April 1994: Voters elect a single 400-member constituent assembly, one-half of whom are elected on the basis of the nationwide results and the other half on the basis of each party's showing in specific geographic regions. Only parties polling more than five percent of the vote are included in the constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * 1994 to 1995: The constituent assembly appoints a cabinet to include all parties with more than five or ten percent of the seats in the assembly. The assembly rules the country while it draws up a new constitution. The ANC is suggesting that decisions should be made on the basis of a two-thirds majority, but that on matters concerning the powers of regions, a two-thirds majority of the regional delegates will be required.  The National Party says key decisions should be made by consensus or by a three-quarters majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * 1995 to 1999: The Government of National Unity, which the ANC proposed earlier this year, will rule the country until the first elections are held under the new constitution no later than five years after the elections for the constituent assembly. The ANC proposal calls for a strong executive presidency, elected by a simple majority, to appoint a cabinet made up of representatives of all parties with more than five percent of the seats in the constituent assembly. The National Party wants a weaker presidency and decision making by consensus.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African blacks -- 75 percent of the population -- still cannot vote. To draw up a new nonracial constitution that would give them that right, 19 organizations -- a dozen of them black -- sent some 200 delegates to the Convention for a Democratic South Africa in December 1991. Tense but hopeful from the beginning, the talks collapsed in June 1992, with everyone blaming everyone else for the bloody escalation of violence in the townships.  The ANC accused President Frederik W. de Klerk's white National Party of allowing it.  BY September terrible loss of life brought the parties together again. Everyone agreed that the talks had to resume and the fighting had to stop. But no one agreed on what was causing the violence. Tribalism is the easy answer.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;That's a lie!&quot; says Archbishop Desmond Tutu. &quot;In Soweto we have lived harmoniously. I am Xhosa. I have a Zulu family on one side. A Swazi family there. A Mopedi over there. A Motswana there. If we quarrel, it is because you have a new suit and I am jealous. We have never quarreled in Soweto because of tribalism.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the Reverend Allan Boesak, an ANC leader from Cape Town, &quot;township violence is a legacy of apartheid -- a system that is violent in itself. But there was a dangerous glorification of the armed struggle; we romanticized it. Our kids grew up with the idea that you are only a hero in the struggle if you are willing to kill someone. It's destroying our soul.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black South Africa is arguably the most complex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community in Africa: A population of 30 million people, half urban, half rural... definable in terms of the most oppressive legislation in Africa but just as definable in terms of resistance to oppression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite dire headlines, black South Africans manage much normalcy in day-to-day living. Babies are born, families raised, weddings and birthdays celebrated. There is work and play, warmth and love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I am oppressed by this government, yes,&quot; a Soweto vendor told me, &quot;but I am not oppressed. I have life; I have hope for better.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Campaign for first democratic election gears up as negotiations on procedures continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegations from 26 political parties meet this week in South Africa to hammer out a process for nonracial elections, while small teams of lawyers and negotiators argue over every detail of the negotiations. Larger working groups in the African National Congress (ANC) and National Party are gearing up for the contest they hope will come a year from now when voters finally go to the polls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the ANC's National Headquarters in Johannesburg, Popo Molefe has a plan to set up 100 voter education offices around the country and launch a grass-roots, door-to-door effort to persuade voters to go to the polls. &quot;You have to remember, 18 million of the 21 million people likely to take part have never voted before,&quot; says Molefe, who heads the ANC election committee.  The ANC, which is campaigning with the slogan &quot;Now is the Time,&quot; is concerned that most of its support will come from those first-time voters who may be kept from the polls by continuing violence.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In March, the ruling National Party established an elections campaign committee based in Pretoria to run their effort. State President F.W. de Klerk helped launch the formal campaign at a rally on March 27 in the &quot;Coloured&quot; township of Goodwood near Cape Town. Heading up the party's effort is Olaus Van Zyl, who is beginning by reviving the National Party's campaign apparatus and making plans to establish local offices in black townships for the first time. Other issues to be decided in the next few weeks, Van Zyl says, include a new symbol for the party and finalizing major slogans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One major unresolved issue is the actual date for elections. Both ANC and National Party officials say that they expect elections in March or April 1994, but predicting election dates in South Africa is a dangerous exercise.  Last year, as negotiators prepared for the second round of multiparty Codesa (Convention for a Democratic South Africa) talks in May, top ANC advisors predicted that an interim executive including all of the parties would be ruling the country by October 1992, and elections would be held in April 1993. That seemingly solid agreement broke down in a dispute over the government's refusal to address continuing violence and over the percentage of votes necessary to make decisions in the constitution-making body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What makes the two major parties optimistic that this round of talks will succeed is the agreement reached in bilateral negotiations on a timetable and outlines of a plan for a transition leading to elections (see &quot;Countdown to Democracy&quot; on page 3).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are still major unresolved questions, including the precise boundaries and powers of the regional governments, the mechanics of the elections process, and the percentage of votes necessary to make decisions in the constituent assembly. But the ANC and the National Party both believe these issues can be resolved quickly. In the negotiations that begin this week, they will be seeking to draw other political organizations -- particularly Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the Conservative Party -- into the negotiation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Could the ANC lose? Whatever the final election plan, many observers have assumed that the arithmetic of South Africa's population distribution should grant Nelson Mandela's ANC a substantial victory in an impartial election. Seventy-four percent of the population is black, and leaning heavily toward the ANC, while just 14 percent is white. The mixed race people, who under apartheid were categorized as &quot;Coloureds&quot; represent nine percent, while Indians account for another three percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But ANC national election coordinator, Popo Molefe, says that for inexperienced voters, violence or the threat of violence could discourage turnout in the black community. While Molefe believes the ANC will win, he notes that these problems will not affect white voters who form the core of the National Party's support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South African political scientist Andrew Reynolds believes the ANC might lose to a coalition made up of the National Party and Inkatha. Writing in the Christian Science Monitor, Reynolds suggests that if the ANC wins slightly less than 50 percent of the national vote, the National Party might win 30 percent of the overall vote and strike a deal with Inkatha to form a coalition that could control a simple majority in the constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;What the international community must take note of,&quot; Reynolds writes, &quot;is the totally uneven playing field on which the election campaign in South Africa is being fought.&quot; The National Party has considerable electoral experience and financial resources and, even under the most far-reaching transitional arrangement, will still effectively control administration of the state apparatus, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other pollsters such as Mark Orkin have put ANC support at 60 percent, the National Party at 17 percent, the PAC at eight percent, the Conservatives at six percent and Inkatha at five percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Reynolds scenario may be a worst case, but ANC planners are taking the threat seriously. &quot;A lot of people who have been interviewed in research surveys,&quot; says Molefe, &quot;feel that it will be a major personal risk for them to take part in elections.&quot; In one recent poll, 16 percent of black South Africans said that they would not vote if faced with the threat of violence.  As a result, the first stage of the ANC's campaign is focused on convincing people that the vote will be safe and secret.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The task is not easy. Molefe says the ANC has not been able to open an office or organize any public events for at least six months in the area known as Boputhatswana, which was declared an independent territory under apartheid. One rally planned for March 21 this year had to be moved after the Boputhatswana police erected road blocks to prevent it from happening. &quot;Not even the churches are being allowed to do nonpartisan voter education in Boputhatswana at the moment,&quot; says Molefe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political violence in some areas of Northern Natal and in the Ciskei bantustan also has prevented the ANC branches there from organizing. The movement's leadership will be demanding access to these areas during the next round of negotiations, but Molefe warned that the ANC also may organize mass action campaigns to force more open political space.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Another major component of the ANC's early campaigning will be informing people that in order to vote they will need to get identification documents. The ANC estimates that between 4 million and 5 million eligible voters, many of whom are rural Africans and women, don't posses these documents. Voters without IDs will have to obtain special voter identification cards issued by an independent electoral commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The congress will be producing pamphlets and using radio and television advertising as well as mobile video units in its efforts. But with illiteracy rates running at about 30 percent in the black community, the ANC is also relying heavily on door-to-door campaigns. &quot;We hope to have identified every single voter in the country by the end of May,&quot; Molefe says.  &quot;We've probably reached about five percent at the moment.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Black votes for the party of apartheid. While the ANC is just starting to establish its campaign offices, at National Party election headquarters, Olaus Van Zyl already has a basic network of local chapters that his party has used in whites-only elections for more than 40 years. Van Zyl says the National Party is just beginning to gear up for the next vote, with the first big push concentrated on a grass-roots effort to train local party activists, expand membership and open up new branches in black areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a process that actually started two years ago, when the previously all-white party opened up membership to all races. Although Van Zyl declined to provide figures for party membership, he said that recent opinion polls indicate it is doing extremely well, particularly in &quot;Coloured&quot; and Indian communities, a fact that the ANC's Molefe acknowledges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When it comes to the black communities, the ANC has got by far the majority of the support, and the National Party support varies between ten and 20 percent,&quot; Van Zyl says. &quot;We realize of course that we would have to get more than double that support to win an election, so we are working very hard on getting more support in the black communities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of this effort, the party has opened up its first campaign offices in Soweto and Kwathema townships. But they also face intimidation.  &quot;People join us and say please don't put our names on lists because we may be in danger if people know we are members,&quot; Van Zyl says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These fears received an added boost earlier this year, when Moses Mayekiso, trade union leader closely allied to the ANC, was reported to have declared that white parties would not be welcome in the black townships. The ANC quickly disavowed the comment, which Mayekiso says was misunderstood.  Nonetheless, Van Zyl says it has been particularly difficult for the National Party to campaign in Seboking township and other areas near Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As part of its effort to reach out to new voters, the National Party is relying more than in previous campaigns on radio advertising and door-to-door canvassing, social evenings and meetings, as well as larger campaign rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Describing how the party that introduced apartheid will</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">make its pitch to black voters, Van Zyl says: &quot;Yes, the National Party brought in a policy which they called apartheid. But the whole situation of black people not voting in South Africa existed since 1652 when the first white people landed. Separate race areas were first implemented by the English.&quot; In his view, the important thing for black voters to realize is that the party has changed, and that it now supports a democratic nonracial system. He also suggests that the National Party may be able to pick up support among more conservative rural black people in the Northern Transvaal or the Orange Free State where isolated communities lack trust in the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Noting that National Party policies differ little from those of Inkatha, the Christian Democratic Party in Boputhatswana or several other smaller parties, Van Zyl suggests the likelihood of working alliances with several of these groups during the campaign. Such an alliance, even if it did not win a majority, could cross the 33 percent threshold needed to block decisions in the constituent assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this point, Inkatha is concentrating its campaigning in the Natal region, where Chief Buthelezi's KwaZulu is located, although on March 21, Inkatha officials bussed in some 10,000 supporters for a rally in Vosloorus, near Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For its part, the ANC enters the election campaign with a strong alliance already in place that includes the trade union federation, Cosatu, and the South African Communist Party. The 1.5-million-member labor grouping is urging its affiliates to begin voter education drives on the factory floor. But, in an indication of the pressures the ANC is under even from its own supporters, Cosatu is tying its campaigning for the ANC to a specific &quot;reconstruction accord&quot; program that commits a future government to a comprehensive program of jobs creation, education and training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Another major problem,&quot; says Molefe, &quot;is that we have been finding it very difficult to raise funds for the elections campaign.&quot; The ANC is trying to find $55 million for its campaign chest but so far has only managed to raise about $1 million. &quot;People are saying they want to support the democratization process, and they will give money to nonpartisan activities but not to political activity,&quot; says Molefe. What the international community doesn't recognize, he argues, is that because it is not in the interests of the National Party to register more black voters, the burden of voter education is going to fall on the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is at a further disadvantage, says Molefe, because they are building their campaign from scratch while the National Party has many years of experience and is able to draw on the resources -- and budgets -- of its members of parliament and more affluent white voter base. The ANC also charges that the existing local government structures are being used to promote the National Party campaign. To support this charge, Molefe brandishes a pamphlet put out in the name of the National Party that was paid for with local government money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party's Van Zyl declines to release campaign budgets, but he says the party probably will spend less than what the ANC is spending.  &quot;We've got constituency boards. We have members of parliament. It's not that we have to set up a total structure from the start,&quot; he says. &quot;Therefore we do not need as much money as the ANC to get structures going all over the country.&quot; n</SPAN></P>

In every 100 people in Zimbabwe, 52 are women.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">For every 100 people queuing for bread, 60 are women. Out of every 100 people in line for mealie-meal, 80 are women. At a political rally of 1500 people, 1000 of them are women. It is the women who till 70% of the land, and yet they own no land. Women feed the nation and yet remain marginalized. It is the men who own the land and it is the men who decide what to do with the harvest. Women are the main consumers of goods and products, yet they do not make any fiscal or monetary decisions. They are the majority of the civil servants, and yet they do not make decisions in the Public Service. The majority of teachers are women, and yet they do not make decisions in the Ministry of Education.  Women staff the Ministry of Health, and yet they are frustrated daily. Women in Zimbabwe, are marginalized, and with the passing away of Amai Sally Mugabe in January 1992, women have no representative at State functions and there is no mother figure at the State House.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Pieces of Africa&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Elektra Nonesuch 79275-2)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Kronos Quartet with Dumisani Maraire, ngoma, hosho, vocals, mbira; Foday Musa Suso, kora; Hamza El Din, tar; Obo Addy, donno, brekete, aketse, gidi, vocals; Radouane Laktib, oud, vocals; Said Hakmoun, bander, vocals; Dan Pauli, hosho; and the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We've finally listened to Kronos Quartet's much-ballyhooed CD &quot;Pieces of Africa,&quot; and it's a winner -- a good collection that mostly lives up to its reputation. It's a 67-minute collection of cross-cultural music by seven African composers from Zimbabwe, Sudan, Gambia, Uganda, Ghana and South Africa, some of whom accompany the quartet on five of the eight cuts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's strongest pieces, however, are seven compositions that take up just over two-thirds of the disc. Another 21 minutes is a five-movement suite, &quot;White Man Sleeps,&quot; by exiled South African Kevin Volans, that is, at best, interesting, although its fourth and fifth movements are strong, intense compositions that seem to conclude just when they're getting started.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the still uninitiated: Kronos Quartet is the 20-year-old U.S.  string quartet, much praised for its innovations with classical, jazz and &quot;world&quot; music, frequently driven by social commentary and protest. Its 1989 album, &quot;Different Trains,&quot; received a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Composition; &quot;Pieces of Africa,&quot; released last February as its tenth album, was number one on Billboard's Top Classical and Top Adult Alternative charts last summer. Some Kronos enthusiasts say &quot;Pieces of Africa&quot; is the group's most innovative release to date. Listening to the seven pieces that occupy most of the disc, one can understand why.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Especially enticing is &quot;Escalay&quot; (&quot;Waterwheel&quot;) by Sudanese composer Hamza El Din, who accompanies the quartet on the tar, a hand-held drum. This entrancing 12-minute piece -- the longest continuous composition on the disc -- has a distinctly Middle Eastern sound that ebbs and flows rhythmically over a brooding bass line that might remind old-time jazz lovers of the double bass line of John Coltrane's &quot;Ole.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Equally lovely is &quot;Kutambarara&quot; (&quot;Spreading&quot;) by Zimbabwean Dumisani Maraire, a seven-minute gospel song that includes Maraire on several instruments and vocals, along with Dan Pauli and the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a call-response composition filled with percussion and counterpointed harmony. The male voice calls out over hand claps and the repeated, responding chant of the choir. Although the song's roots on this disc are among the Shona people of Zimbabwe, one can hear versions of this gospel form throughout South Africa, especially in the Methodist and Congregational churches, where the singing congregation keeps time with a heavy bass &quot;thud&quot; of bibles and prayer books hit mightily against their hands. That &quot;thud&quot; is missing on &quot;Kutambarara,&quot; giving it a uniqueness that might remind gospel music listeners of the hand-clap time keeping of African American gospel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should be noted here that none of this music is purely grounded in Africa. Consistent throughout all of the compositions is the Kronos interpretation and interplay -- a &quot;fusion,&quot; if you will, between indigenous African and U.S.-European classical music. Quartet members even abandon their strings sometimes for thumb pianos and percussion and sometimes thump the strings of the cello as if it were a jazz bass fiddle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On &quot;Ekitundu Ekisooka&quot; (&quot;First Movement&quot;), a five-minute piece by Ugandan Justinian Tamusuza, for example, Kronos plays unaccompanied, but the sound is decidedly Middle Eastern. The violins, frequently used instruments in Middle Eastern music, drone over a thudding polyrhythmic beat (a drum, perhaps, or is it hands against the cello?) reminiscent of the music made popular in the United States by Ravi Shankar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The other distinctly Middle Eastern piece, &quot;Saade,&quot; (I'm Happy&quot;) is a four-minute song that includes the singing and sintir playing of its North African composer Hassan Hakmoun, along with Said Hakmoun on bander and vocals, and Radouane Laktib on oud and vocals. Again, the violins drone and whine over the polyrhythms, this time intensified by the innovative accents of the human voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On &quot;Tilliboyo&quot; (&quot;Sunset&quot;), another four-minute composition, Kronos is accompanied by the song's Gambian composer, Foday Musa Suso, on kora, a 21-string instrument. Here, the quartet's violins come in lightly in what might normally be a flute line, as the kora and thumb piano play lyrically underneath.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Completing this CD are &quot;Wawshishijay&quot; (&quot;Our Beginning&quot;), a five-minute song by Ghanaian Obo Addy, who sings and plays a variety of instruments, including the gidi, aketse and brekete; and &quot;Mai Nozipo&quot; (&quot;Mother Nozipo&quot;), the second composition by Zimbabwean Maraire in tribute to his mother.  &quot;Wawshishijay&quot; is an intensive, percussion-filled song highlighted by a stirring harmony between voice and cello. It should have been longer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Mai Nozipo,&quot; an exuberant, seven-minute composition, features an unaccompanied Kronos, whose members play joyful fiddles and, again, discard some of their strings for inspired polyrhythmic percussion. One understands when listening to his piece that Maraire loves and is inspired by his mother.  One also feels that Kronos understands this love.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Kronos Quartet, this CD might be considered a good &quot;beginning,&quot; in spite of the quartet's 20-year, ten-album history -- members have said that they have a score of other composers commissioned to write material for them -- and one looks forward to what their future work might hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, this disc is a good buy for those who love African music and who want to enter a cross-cultural world where Europe and Africa meet, American-style.  n</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (Note: For those who wish to catch Kronos live, the quartet is finishing up its 1992-93 U.S. tour with scheduled appearances at Herbst Theatre (San Francisco), April 29; Hult Center (Eugene, OR), April 30; University of Washington (Seattle), May 1; and the UCLA Center for the Arts (Los Angeles), May 8. Its Japanese tour is scheduled for May 10-22.)</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The winds of democracy that are blowing across Africa have reached Malawi, a long-neglected backwater that for nearly 30 years has been held in the grip of one man.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hastings Kamuza Banda, who has headed Malawi since its independence in 1964 and calls himself &quot;life president,&quot; has been forced to yield to the forces of reform. After decades in which all dissent was suppressed and government opponents imprisoned and exiled, the country is preparing for a June 14 referendum on whether to end one-party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a largely successful attempt to isolate Malawi from the modern world, Banda has enforced quasi-Victorian dress codes and banning television as a pernicious influence. The government also has maintained strict control over the mass media and has barred foreign journalists from the country for decades. All private correspondence, both internal and external, has been systematically opened and censored, as have all publications. Telephones are routinely tapped, and the country has been honeycombed with a vast network of spies and informers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As has happened elsewhere in the world, the pro- democracy campaign in Malawi has gotten a boost from a modern technological tool, the facsimile machine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike previously available forms of communication, fax transmissions proved virtually invulnerable to government censorship. Large numbers of dissidents both inside and outside the country have capitalized on this fact to flood the country with anti-government circulars and documents. The material can be sent by fax from one area to another, and duplicates can be made for dissemination to the smallest villages. I once witnessed a stack of illicit handouts being wrapped inside a bolt of fabric, for distribution into the countryside.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the aging Banda himself retains a measure of respect from many Malawians, those closest to him are the object of widespread loathing. John Temba, minister of state and Banda's heir apparent, and Temba's niece, Cecilia Tamanda Kadzamira, who is Banda's official hostess, are believed to be the real powers in the country and are regularly accused of misappropriating Malawi's assets and other crimes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other circulars extol the virtues of the opposition, particularly Chakufwa Chihana, the trade union leader who was jailed after returning to Malawi last year to campaign for change. One of the clandestine posters I saw referred to Chihana as the &quot;Lion of Malawi,&quot; an appellation hitherto reserved exclusively for Banda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International pressure and attention have provided important underpinning to the opposition drive. When major donor countries last year announced a suspension of aid to Malawi, the government was forced to make compromises. The referendum on multiparty rule is one; release of long-serving political prisoners is another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The nation was stunned last June by the freeing of Machipisa Munthali, an early victim of Banda's purges who had been held for 27 years, roughly the same period as Nelson Mandela. While in prison, Munthali was fed only cornmeal porridge, pigeon peas and water and was denied access to all reading matter, including the Bible. He was not allowed visits from his children, and hardly anyone expected him to emerge alive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;International pressure is working,&quot; one middle-aged man screamed upon hearing the news about Munthali. Turning to me,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">he exclaimed: &quot;You can't imagine how grateful we are.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World scrutiny also has seemed to influence the government's handling of Chihana. He was released after his first detention, although he was later rearrested and charged. Earlier this month, his two-year sentence was reduced to nine months, advancing his release date to June 14, the day of the referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increasing numbers of Malawians have joined in the democracy campaign.  Not even the sentencing of Chihana to two years of hard labor last year seemed to impair opposition morale. People routinely refer to the labor leader as &quot;president-in-waiting&quot; and, risking arrest themselves, continue to shout his name and other anti-government slogans as official government vehicles pass by.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elsewhere, such behavior might not be viewed as risky. But in a country where the predominant human emotion for more than a generation has been debilitating fear, this is an unprecedented upsurge of outspokenness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is hard to convey to those outside Malawi just how much foreign radio broadcasts mean to people whose only other source of information is rumor. The Voice of America is generally looked upon as worthless, but the BBC is virtually worshipped. Malawians with access to radios drop all activity to listen, and people excitedly discuss every report they hear that mentions their homeland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, after a steady stream of reporting on Malawi, news dried up as events in other places dominated the broadcasts. Malawians were hurt and bewildered to realize that the West's attention had shifted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I once asked a young friend of mine who lives in a typical village if she had seen the pastoral letter written by Malawi's Roman Catholic bishops in early 1992. The letter, called &quot;Living Our Faith,&quot; contains the most forthright, comprehensive and devastating indictment of Banda's regime ever openly published and disseminated inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;No,&quot; my friend replied. She had heard about it, as everybody had, but she had never seen it, she told me. I offered her a copy of the document, which in this devoutly Christian country had been declared illegal to possess. She took it with wariness and started laboriously plodding her way through the unfamiliar English phrases until, with dawning incredulity, she visibly began to grasp the meaning. &quot;A growing gap between the rich and poor ... our people's experience of unfairness and injustice ... a climate of mistrust and fear ... the voiceless who live in situations of hopelessness.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With an expression of utter revelation, scarcely daring to believe what she was reading, the young woman looked up and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said: &quot;They have written the truth!&quot; *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ellen Drummond is a pseudonym for a writer who has recently left Malawi after a lengthy stay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the United States is preoccupied with the power struggle in Russia and the fate of Srebrenicans in Bosnia, parts of Africa are facing similar death and destruction. In Angola, the heart of Africa, estimates of people killed since civil war resumed in October range as high as 30,000.  While Bosnia seems to defy solution, the United States has the power to stem some of the slaughter in Angola by a simple act of recognition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Clinton administration should establish formal diplomatic relations with Angola. Recognition of the government of President Eduardo dos Santos by the United States would fulfill a promise, help to clarify the combat situation, signal U.S. commitment to the electoral process, and ultimately save lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angola has plunged back into civil war because Jonas Savimbi, the head of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), refused to accept the outcome of September's elections. The United States should have acted quickly at the time, but in the tumult of our own election we did not.  Through the Bicesse Accords of May 1991, which ended 16 years of Angolan conflict, the United States tacitly promised to recognize an Angolan government that emerged from free and fair elections. By virtually all accounts, the September elections were free and fair. Dos Santos' Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) won the legislature by an overwhelming 67 percent and could, therefore, choose a prime minister and form a government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dos Santos narrowly missed receiving a presidential majority, polling 49.57 percent, compared to 20.07 percent for Savimbi. The rebel leader cried foul, and civil war resumed. The second round of voting -- called for if no candidate won a simple majority -- never took place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six months later, the war-weary southern African nation is locked in bloody fighting that has touched virtually every family in the nation of 10 million. Major cities are yo-yos swinging back and forth between control by government and Unita forces, with appalling damage being inflicted by both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recognition of the dos Santos government would bring U.S. policy in line with that of its Western allies as well as with the desires of most African nations. France, Portugal, Britain and Germany all recognized Angola more than a decade ago. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) is urging the United States to speed recognition, and President Clinton has received letters to that effect from former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and former Nigerian President Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo. Leading newspapers in the United States and Great Britain and a majority of the members of both houses of Congress have joined the call.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given this overwhelming consensus, it is difficult to understand constraints preventing the new administration from acting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Traditionally, the United States has based recognition on control of territory and a government's claim to represent the citizenry. While territorial control slips back and forth between Unita and the MPLA, the latter still holds much of the country, and the elections have legitimized its claim to represent the people. We should stand by our word and acknowledge the government's undisputed legislative victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By not recognizing Angola, the United States continues tacit support for Jonas Savimbi. Conversely, U.S. recognition would signal to the Unita leader that his former patron is just that -- a former backer who is now advocating an equitable resolution of a long-standing conflict. Without U.S.  support, Savimbi would be left with only one ally, South Africa, and would be more likely to turn to negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are other steps the United States should take after</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">recognition:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * First, the United States should demand that Savimbi attend United Nations-sponsored peace talks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Second, the U.S. government should pledge to oversee a new UN effort for the demobilization of the Unita and MPLA armies and the integration of both into a single fighting force. Although neither side demobilized their troops as promised in the peace accord, Savimbi complied less fully and therefore emerged initially stronger in the resumed fighting. Integrating the army is one key to peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Third, we must demand an immediate cease-fire. In renewed fighting, Savimbi may have captured as much as 65 percent of the land mass of the country, but it is doubtful that he could capture all of Angola. Experts envision a bloody stalemate with continued high casualties. (Over 10,000 people have died already in the battle for the city of Huambo.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Fourth, we should commit the United States to lead a UN effort to monitor the runoff presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not to act is to invite future problems. Angola is a bellwether for other African trouble spots that ache for resolution. A thousand miles to the north and west, Charles Taylor, the military strongman who invaded Liberia in December 1989, is toying with the notion of accepting a brokered cease-fire and agreeing to multiparty elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tacit U.S. support for Savimbi says to Taylor that no decision or commitment is binding and that an election outcome does not have to be final.  If it is not to your liking, refuse to accept it and restart the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other side of the continent in civil war-riven Somalia, failure to stand up to Savimbi will undermine UN and OAU efforts to deal forcefully with the clans and warlords. If there are no sanctions for failure to abide by the terms of international decrees and edicts, why waste time negotiating with the UN, and why honor any agreement that has been reached?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also in East Africa, Mozambique is moving quietly toward UN-run elections. But resumed hostilities in Angola may suggest to Alphonse Dhlakama, leader of the anti-government Renamo movement, that he rethink the peace accord or up the ante. Already, elections planned for next October have been postponed because of the slow pace of demobilization. Every delay makes peace more fragile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Salim Salim, secretary-general of the OAU, visited the United States last month, he underscored the urgency of U.S. recognition of Angola.  Africa is watching us closely on this one. Africans really do look at the United States as the world's leading democracy -- a role model that is expected to do the right thing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is a rare instance where an attractive policy option will also yield an important humanitarian result. But even more important, recognition is a clear signal that our government is ending a misbegotten, outdated Cold War policy of supporting Savimbi. The United States should seize upon this win/win situation and move to support reconciliation and rebuilding in Angola. *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The assassination of South African leader Chris Hani has the potential to either propel the negotiations process forward or plunge the country into an explosive crisis, say analysts inside the country. What actually happens will depend on the skills of negotiators on all sides and, according to the African National Congress (ANC), on the government's willingness to set an early date for elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The immediate result of Hani's death was a week of street demonstrations and popular protests and new calls for government action against right-wing death squads. Shortly after the shooting, the ANC angrily noted that Hani had survived two previous assassination attempts and that they had made a written request for police protection several months ago. But the movement's leadership has also been at pains to avoid a backlash. &quot;It may have been the hand of a white male that slaughtered him, but it was the eyes of a white woman who helped us catch this bastard,&quot; declared ANC Witwatersand Chair Tokyo Sexwale at one rally. He was referring to Hani's neighbor, Retha Harmse, whose report of a car license plate number led to the capture of the alleged assassin. And Nelson Mandela repeatedly appealed for calm in speeches that were shown on state-owned television in prime time.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;(Hani's death) has created a new situation in the country,&quot; says ANC negotiator Mohammed Valli Moosa, &quot;a completely new vibe. We need to have some sort of dramatic announcement within the next few weeks, if the situation isn't to become completely uncontrollable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC has moved quickly to channel popular anger at Hani's death into renewed pressure on the government to shut down right-wing death squads, set a date for elections and establish a transitional executive that has control over the armed forces. The movement announced plans for a series of demonstrations, marches and civil disobedience protests throughout the month of May to press these goals. &quot;We think that there is a real possibility of it propelling the process forward, because the government is under a tremendous amount of pressure right now,&quot; says Valli, who is executive secretary of the ANC Negotiations Committee and a member of the South African Communist Party.  He notes that ANC demands for an election date and joint control of the army have been echoed by several newspapers and by a growing number of political leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hani is not easily replaced. At the same time, Valli and others acknowledge that with the murder of Chris Hani, the ANC has lost one of its most popular township leaders at a time when activists are becoming increasingly disaffected by the compromises necessary for negotiations to proceed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hani had a quality of knowing exactly how people are feeling on the ground,&quot; says Gabu Tugwana, deputy editor of the independent weekly newspaper New Nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the ANC, the ability to know and articulate the frustrations and aspirations of township residents will be increasingly important. As the movement enters its fourth year of negotiations with the government, there are new hopes that elections will be held next year. Yet there have been no fundamental changes in the standard of living or in material conditions for the vast majority of black South Africans. &quot;Mandela Released Three Years Ago, South Africa Still Not Free,&quot; read a sign carried at demonstrations after Hani's death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He knew our pain,&quot; declared Nelson Mandela before a crowd of some 80,000 at the funeral service for Hani in Soweto. And it was as a spokesman for the pain of the black majority that Hani played his most important role.  A negotiated transfer of power inevitably requires compromise on all sides, as the ANC's recent agreement to a five-year period of coalition government indicates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concessions have provoked rebellion within the organization and strong criticism of its leadership. The idea of a five-year coalition government rather than unfettered elections is unpopular in many townships, and Mandela himself was booed at a memorial service for Hani in Soweto when he suggested the ANC would have to work with South African President F.W. de Klerk and the ruling National Party to construct a new South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview with this reporter two years ago, Hani suggested that creating these divisions was part of de Klerk's strategy. &quot;De Klerk wants to negotiate with a weakened ANC, and he is using violence to weaken the ANC. De Klerk also wants to negotiate with an ANC that is away from the masses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was building this link with the township base that Hani saw as his principal role. &quot;Chris Hani was the umbilical cord between the African National Congress and the masses,&quot; says ANC youth league leader Peter Mokaba.  When violence was plaguing the townships, Hani argued for the ANC to form self defense groups and then pressed for them to be closed down when they got out of hand. More recently he had been demanding that the government surrender control of the military and police and incorporate members of the ANC's military wing into the Defense Force. He also spoke out against the ANC's marginalization of returning exiles who, he charged, have returned to &quot;stand in unemployment lines.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A man of peace as well as war. Although many press reports have portrayed Hani as recently evolved from a radical guerrilla leader to a moderate who favored negotiations, Hani never saw his militant image as incompatible with negotiations. &quot;We are involved in the struggle for the liberation of our people,&quot; he said. &quot;We have used a number of strategies to step up the struggle to eliminate apartheid from our society.&quot; But he made it clear that the goal always was to force de Klerk into negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hani was a visible and leading presence at both the Codesa negotiations between the government and its opponents last year and, more recently, at the multiparty talks convened in early April. When theologian Charles Villa Vincencio asked him recently about his image as a radical, Hani replied that the ANC &quot;must not lose that image. Should it do so, it will lose the support of many young people. That will be fatal in terms of our goal to build a nation in the future.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But both Hani's image and his leadership of the South African Communist Party were used by opponents to discredit him. He was the last of the returning ANC leadership to be granted immunity from prosecution and to be allowed to operate freely inside South Africa. The Communist Party charges that in the past few months there had been a concerted campaign of disinformation, including rumors that Hani wanted to start his own army with estranged ANC leader Winnie Mandela to force the government to give up power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hani's service as chief of staff of the ANC's military wing, Umkhonto weSizwe, during a time when the organization was detaining, torturing and killing some of its own members, led to the harshest criticism, even from some within the ANC organization. He responded that &quot;there have been injustices and wrongful deeds committed in our name. The detention and torture camps are among them.&quot; While arguing that these actions should be placed in historical context, Hani also publicly called on the ANC leadership to continue its investigation of what happened in ANC camps and suggested that ANC members guilty of abuses should not be allowed to serve in a new security force. The same should also be true, he argued, for those guilty of abuses while working for the National Party government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Whatever his critics thought, Hani was tremendously popular. When the ANC held elections for its ruling national executive in 1991, he received more votes than any other candidate (Mandela had already been elected president). And in several opinion polls in the last few months he has been second only to Mandela himself in popularity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the two weeks before he was killed, Hani had more than 20 speaking engagements in rural areas and squatter communities around the country. &quot;The issue now is not armed struggle but elections,&quot; he told an audience at one of these rallies. &quot;That needs a climate of peace and stability. We cannot afford to have the process delayed and disrupted by violent elements. Every ANC supporter should be a combatant, but a combatant now for peace.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The charismatic, 50-year-old leader, who studied Latin and classical literature and contemplated becoming either a priest or a lawyer, had the background to argue persuasively for peace, says the New Nation's Tugwana.  &quot;He is a person who fought on the ground in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), he knew the war in Angola. So when he talks about a war, and says the time for a war has come to an end, people feel he knows what he is talking about.&quot; It is perhaps because of this background that in the last few weeks Hani had been appealing to the Pan Africanist Congress's military wing, APLA, to end a series of recent armed attacks on whites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While arguing for elections and pressing for popular support of negotiations, Hani also declared that in order to continue pressing for radical change, he would not join an ANC-led coalition government.  &quot;I don't want to be involved,&quot; he told the Sunday Times of Johannesburg. &quot;I want the freedom to criticize from outside, to lead marches, to organize strikes, to pressure the new government into doing the right things.&quot; At that point, said Hani, he would devote his principal energies to pressing the social program of the South African Communist Party, which he headed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was that balance, or tension, that gave Hani his strength and legitimacy among his constituency. He both called for participation in elections and pressed for more radical change. Now, with Hani gone, it is even more in the interest of the government to respond to these demands, one of Hani's close friends, Tokyo Sexwale, declared at a recent rally. &quot;It can't be business as usual,&quot; said Sexwale. &quot;There is a new urgency. We need a transitional executive in place now. The youth are exasperated. People are feeling that they must take something from all this. It's not a case of saying the ANC should deliver -- we can't deliver what we don't have. The government has to deliver.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This piece was filed just before the April 23-25 referendum on independence from Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An unmistakeable mood of optimism fills this city of 400,000 that hugs the Red Sea coast. Palm trees line many of the boulevards, and outdoor cafes are numerous along Victory Avenue, Asmara's main thoroughfare. One is reminded of a small city along the Mediterranean. With a 30-year war finally over, all kinds of small businesses have sprung up. Cobblers, butchers and tailors line the narrow streets near the center of the city.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Skinder Abebe, a 30-year-old cobbler, runs a small shop along Victory Avenue. &quot;The war is finished, and we are doing a good job of picking up the pieces,&quot; he says. &quot;Still most of us are a bit sad about the past.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A robust and cheerful man, Abebe works until well past dark most nights. He is paid by those who patronize his tiny shop and receives a small food allowance from the provisional government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his quiet shop he repairs shoes and the occasional small harness.  Like most Eritreans, Abebe has sacrificed much. His wife, a guerilla fighter with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF), was killed in fierce fighting two weeks before the war's bloody conclusion, in May 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There are many like me in Asmara,&quot; says Abebe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After 30 years of nonstop war with Ethiopia, initially against the government of Emperor Haile Selassie and, after 1974, against the Marxist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam, Eritreans have been looking forward with both relief and uncertainty to the referendum that will make them legally independent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, in the coffeehouses and restaurants of the capital, it is impossible to find anyone planning to vote &quot;no.&quot; Of equal significance, the leadership ranks of Eritrea's provisional government are thick with former guerrillas of the Eritrean Peoples' Liberation Front (EPLF), and all are optimistic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We are hoping that the referendum will make us more attractive to foreign investors and help us to rid ourselves of (our) unemployment problem,&quot; says Deputy Minister of Labor Zeratzion Woldeghebriels. &quot;We have had some valuable talks with the American Embassy in Addis Ababa, and we have very high expectations from the United Nations' groups in Geneva.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Woldeghebriels was imprisoned in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, from 1977 to 1983. He says that during those six years, he was tortured for his activities in EPLF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A big job ahead. At times it seems that this poor but pleasant tree-lined city is running only on enthusiasm for an uncertain and difficult future. Problems abound. Unemployment is approximately 55 percent. Inflation threatens every family. And due to the flood of refugees from the countryside into Asmara, as well as the destruction of thousands of dwellings by Ethiopian artillery, the housing shortage is critical. Factories stand idle.  The city's water supply is sporadic, and the infrastructure is in desperate need of repair. Eritrea doesn't even have it's own currency and still uses the Ethiopian Birr.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside of Asmara in the semi-desert lowlands, nearly half the population is on food assistance, and life expectancy is only 45 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the region is inhabited by Muslims, who make up 50 percent of Eritrea's population, and the area's inhabitants account for the bulk of membership of the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF), which once was the vanguard of resistance to Ethiopian rule. Many ELF members fear that the new government, dominated by the EPLF, many of whom are christians, does not have their best interests at heart. The ELF has accused authorities of delaying the return of 500,000 refugees being held in Sudan, out of a fear that the returnees will bring militant Islam with them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government denies allegations of unfair treatment. &quot;We are trying to broaden the membership of the EPLF,&quot; said the group's leader, Issaias Afwerki, in a recent interview. &quot;We have already lived for a long time together in peace, and we should continue to do so.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An Eritrean journalist, who preferred that his name not be used, says that &quot;those who make up Afwerki's inner circle have more in common with cabinet members in Ethiopia than they do with the Muslim low-landers.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps in response to the dilemma, Afwerki recently suggested that the only way to deal with the conflict between the two popular fronts may be to abolish them and encourage the development of a new multipartyism with open and free elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end, technical assistance has been provided by both Norway and France. Non-EPLF supporters, however, are complaining that Afwerki's transitional government is not proceeding fairly. Specifically cited by the ELF is the fact that blue ballots are being used for &quot;Yes&quot; votes and red ballots for &quot;No&quot; votes, making a true secret ballot impossible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Eritreans have a strong national identity stemming from the 30-year war waged by the territory's nine ethnic groups, who fought alongside each other against Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government will need to draw heavily upon that strength to build national unity now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the coastal city of Masawa, which was 90 percent destroyed by Ethiopian bombers in 1990, Suleiman Abdu Ali, 41, a soldier with the ELF during the war, warns that today's optimism is fragile and must be nourished by careful policies. &quot;There will be problems later if we aren't treated fairly,&quot; he says. &quot;We're all happy today, but I don't know if we will be tomorrow.&quot; *</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freetown, Sierra Leone</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mariama Kemokai, smiles as she lifts her gray sweater to wipe the sweat from her thin face, revealing a child-bearing belly as wrinkled and rippled as the ocean she is sailing on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But her smile disappears as she considers her recent past. She is one of 226 refugees heading back to Sierra Leone on a boat chartered by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Lutheran World Service.  Most have been through three wars in as many years. The fighting at home forced them and at least 350,000 others to escape across the eastern border to Guinea and to Liberia, a country where war and famine claimed more than 60,000 lives in 1990 alone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's wars often eclipse the problems of its neighbor, but Sierra Leone's troubles are devastating. A guerrilla invasion has wrecked the economy and displaced up to a quarter of the country's 4 million people. More than 120,000 face starvation in an area inaccessible to relief workers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turmoil in the region began in December 1989, when Liberian rebel leader Charles Taylor and a band of his fighters invaded Liberia from Cote d'Ivoire to depose the brutal regime of Samuel Doe. The fighting ballooned into a civil war that left Doe dead and Liberia in ruins. It ended in November 1991 when West African troops sailed into the city and forced a cease-fire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angered that Sierra Leone had allowed the airport to be used to transport soldiers and weapons to Liberia, Taylor sent a group of rebels to invade Sierra Leone in April 1991.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boakarie Kamara, a 65-year-old farmer, remembers. The cocoa and coffee harvest had just ended, and he was resting on the mattress of his iron bed in the southeastern village of Zimi. A group of teenagers with guns ordered him to his feet and threw him into jail with 300 other suspected spies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Sierra Leone and Liberia, your next breath often depends on how many amphetamines a young rebel has popped that day, how much booze he has swallowed, how much marijuana he has inhaled or how long it has been since he ate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kamara would think about this many times after he and his family fled to Liberia. So would Mariama Kemokai and her six young children, the strongest of whom carried his grandmother on his back to Liberia after the rebels invaded their home.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many never made it out of Sierra Leone. Those who did not perish in the invasion faced further hardship once they crossed the Mano river into Liberia. The months of walking, scavenging for food and sleeping rough took their toll. Kemokai's old mother and two of her children fell ill and died.  Boakarie Kamara lost a child to measles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Lissa, 43, is returning home for the second time. He has not seen his family since last summer when rebels of the United Liberation Movement of Democracy for Liberia attacked Liberia, from Sierra Leone, pursuing Taylor's National Patriotic Front fighters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attack left refugees little time. &quot;When we were running I don't know which direction they went,&quot; says Musa Kamara of his three children, still missing. &quot;They are living, they are not living, I don't know. I am living, I am not living, they don't know.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Freetown, Sierra Leone</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I had heard nothing but the worst about Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. The picture I had was of buildings falling apart, piles of trash on every street corner, and roads that were a moonscape the color of Mars. But what I found on arrival was a city in bloom, bursting with the energy of a modern-day revolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My first view of Freetown, the capital, was from a Greek boat that was transporting Sierra Leonean refugees who were returning home through a voluntary repatriation program run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and Lutheran World Service. From the deck of the Remvi, the afternoon sun revealed the dramatic coastline of a city huddled between mountains that plunge into the Atlantic. One story has it that the country was given its name by Portuguese explorers who, after hearing thunder tremble through the peaks, came up with Sierra Leone, meaning lion mountain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The returning refugees were from the countryside, and most had never visited the capital. If they had, they would have hardly recognized the city they were about to enter.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On nearly every block, groups of young people were digging ditches, painting curbstones, planting trees, filling potholes and painting and refurbishing buildings. One youth painted these</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">words to a Michael Jackson song along a street wall: &quot;If you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make a change.&quot; The favorite paint colors appear to be green, white and blue, the colors of the government of 28-year-old president, Capt. Valentine Strasser, and it is his revolution they have joined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strasser ousted President Joseph Momoh one year ago, inheriting a guerrilla war that had spilled over from neighboring Liberia and a devastated economy, the result of decades of corruption. While people in nearly every other country in sub- Saharan Africa are pushing for democratic elections, the impoverished of Freetown say it is a luxury they can not yet afford.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One young man who helps organize a clean-up crew along the beach -- they call themselves the Beach Boys -- told me Freetown's youth are too preoccupied with other problems to worry about voting. &quot;Right now they don't want anything democratic because we have a lot of problems to be solved before we can give power to any civilian.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Strasser has wasted no time in showing his military muscle. Last December the government executed 29 alleged coup plotters on a Freetown beach. People took to the streets afterward, not to protest the killings, but to praise the government for dealing harshly with anyone who might threaten their new-found hope that the corruption of the past is being cleared away as quickly as the sewage from the gutters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has successfully used the clean-up campaign to symbolize a deeper transformation of Sierra Leone from a country where only an elite prospers to one that delivers services to the poor. Electricity and water, although still sporadic, have been restored to city neighborhoods.  Soldiers inspect yards on the last Saturday of each month. Anyone found with dirty property has to dig ditches.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only time will tell if the improvements to Freetown are merely a makeover to distract from the government's more pressing problems, like the war that has virtually halted diamond mining and severely cut agricultural production. My departure from Freetown showed me that Sierra Leoneans have more to be concerned about than they know, and that those who do know are afraid to talk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While nursing a Coca-Cola at the port before boarding the ferry that shuttles passengers to the Lungi Airport, I entertained myself watching tourists (yes, Freetown even has tourists) take pictures and videos. I wondered how long they were going to get away with it. In most African countries with military governments, taking pictures at ports, airports or anywhere else considered strategic is prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I kept my eye on a couple of soldiers in a shiny new red Pajero with a big fat dent in it, accompanied by two decked-out girlfriends inspecting their fingernails in the back seats. The men ignored the tourists. But then one of their buddies in civilian clothes showed up. He wore dark sunglasses and a pair of binoculars hung around his muscular neck.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He began waving his finger and shouting at the tourists to put away their cameras, saying it was forbidden to take pictures</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">after 5 p.m. It was about 5:02, and nobody was aware of this &quot;rule.&quot; By this time the soldiers had joined in harassing the tourists. Finally the man with the binoculars snatched a video camera, opened it and gave the tape to a soldier who tried to pry it apart. He threw it on the ground, crushed it with his foot and tossed it in the water. The tourist turned red and clasped his face with his hands. I wondered how many Sierra Leoneans suffered worse fates for violating &quot;rules&quot; they knew nothing about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once on the ferry, the man with the binoculars further exercised his authority, ordering everyone off the top deck where a little band was playing gospel music. He said it was &quot;the VIP deck,&quot; aware or unaware that diplomats were among those clapping and singing along.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ride from the ferry dock to the airport was a harrowing trip on a two-lane road. The soldiers and their buddy were in a big hurry and it was dusk, when many cars had not yet put on their headlights. After honking its horn and making several attempts to pass, the Pajero zipped into the lane of oncoming traffic and flew past the van I was riding in, forcing at least one approaching car onto the shoulder of the road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it was at the airport where I really began to think that Sierra Leoneans have something to worry about. I was on stand-by for a flight back to Abidjan, and I had to fight my way to the ticket counter through dozens of people who already had reservations. When I got there, they told me there was no more room. As I stood there contemplating my next move, I noticed soldier upon soldier, bejeweled girlfriend upon bejeweled girlfriend, breezing past the ticket counter, waving to customs officials and making their way to the plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I thought it was time to take a peek at the passenger list. Of more than 100 names, only about six were checked off. All around me there were people whose names were on the list, and they were being told there was no room on the plane, although being on stand-by, I had nothing to complain about. &quot;It's corruption,&quot; one man told the ticket counter assistant, who shrugged his shoulders. A woman burst into tears. Some sympathetic men, also vying for seats, urged someone to help her. I considered dredging up a tear or two myself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But I had another dilemma. I knew it was likely there were still seats on that plane. All I had to do was fork over a few dollars to the ticket man, and I would be on my way. I have never gotten used to paying bribes, although as a reporter often trying to get into prohibited places quickly, it is a necessary evil.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This time, however, after seeing such hope and such determination for change in Freetown, I couldn't bring myself to do it. It was a small thing (made a little bigger by the fact that I would have had to spend another night or two or three in the Lungi Airport Hotel), but I felt a little proud of myself. It is not often that I feel proud in Africa, where reporters make their living off people's misery, writing pieces that invariably wind up at the bottom of an editor's story list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then, right there in the Lungi Airport, a little miracle happened.  There was another plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ticket man said, &quot;Who's going to Abidjan?&quot; My hand shot up like a rocket as I screamed, &quot;Me!&quot; along with a couple of others, including the woman in tears. The rest were trying to get to Accra, Ghana. Total confusion broke out. An official grabbed my passport, the ticket man grabbed my ticket, and I was being rushed to this and that booth to pay my &quot;airport tax.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was $12. I only had a $20. &quot;I don't have change,&quot; the tax man said, obviously unaware that I had seen him take about 30 $1 bills from a group of Americans leaving the country. I had no time to argue. I was rushed to customs where a woman said to hand over a few dollars so I wouldn't waste time with a bag search and miss my plane.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So much for my resolve against corruption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hopefully Sierra Leoneans will have greater resolve and their revolution will turn out as good as those boys on the street made it look.  *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Along with the human suffering caused by Rwanda's civil war, the conflict has taken a toll on the gorilla population that inhabits the Virunga Volcano Mountains shared by Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire. Mountain gorillas are the most endangered of the three gorilla sub-species, and today they are only to be found in the Virunga.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was here that naturalist Dian Fossie spent 18 years researching the rare animals until her still-unexplained murder in 1985. The mountains are also where much of the heaviest fighting in the war has occurred, and the sounds of war have frightened many of the gorillas away.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fighting in February also forced staff to flee the Karisoke Research Station, established by Fossey and supported by the U.S.- based Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. Buildings were looted, and anti- poaching squads first introduced by Fossey in 1967 had to leave the area, according to the Associated Press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government accuses the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) of using the Volcano National Park as a base and of responsibility for the Karisoke raid. The rebels say it was the work of government troops and locals. The RPF claims to have evidence that government forces last year killed a legendary gorilla named Titus.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Representatives of the Fossey Fund in the United States have appealed to both the government and the rebels to leave the animals unharmed and to keep the fighting out of the park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political turmoil has taken its toll on animals in this region before.  During the brutal reign of Idi Amin in neighboring Uganda, soldiers moonlighting as poachers decimated the area's elephants. Uganda's elephant population dropped from about 30,000 in 1971, when Amin seized power, to less than 2,000 when he was ousted in 1979. The stock is now estimated to have increased to just over 3,000, thanks to a concerted effort by Uganda's current government.  * (by Charles Onyango-Obbo</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">DATELINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inside rebel-controlled Rwanda</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The last time I visited the Katuna border post on Uganda's frontier with Rwanda, in late 1990, an insurgency that was then two months old looked well on the way to defeat. Rwandan government troops had just retaken control of the area from the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a return trip to the Katuna area reveals a very different picture.  The nearest government position is about 50 miles (81 kilometers) away, and the border post swarms with RPF soldiers dressed mostly in uniforms seized from overrun government positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Negotiations to end the 30-month-old civil war have produced a tentative settlement, and plans are underway for international observers to monitor a cease-fire and oversee elections. But the resumption of fighting in February, following earlier peace talks and a lull in the killing, has demonstrated the difficulty of resolving the country's long-standing differences.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> My journey with the RPF began with a drive from the Katuna border post to a reception center for journalists 15 miles (24 kilometers) inside northern Rwanda. The trip took us through the Mulindi Tea Estate, the largest in Rwanda, which according to the RPF produces 60 percent of the country's tea exports. Rebels say the loss of control over Mulindi, with its modern tea factory, is seriously straining the government economically. Tea is Rwanda's second largest foreign exchange earner after coffee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Northern Rwanda has a beautiful but torturously hilly countryside.  Finding a naturally flat space as large as a football field is rare. To reach the battle front to the south, we had to get out of our van several times so it could climb the steep hills. At times, we had to help by pushing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All along the way, we saw young guerrillas weighed down with supplies walking the hills with apparent ease. &quot;These kids are tough,&quot; says Frank Bamugambagye, the RPF's political commissar. &quot;That's why we beat the government soldiers, who are used to a comfortable life.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Roots of Rebellion. The rebel invasion was launched on October 1, 1990, when about 7,000 Rwandan refugees who were soldiers in the Ugandan army deserted their posts and entered Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The East African nation, southwest of Uganda, is about the size of Maryland with a population of more than 7 million. For most of the past two decades, Rwanda appeared politically stable and economically successful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the country's past has come back to haunt it. For centuries, the tall and elegant Tutsi people ruled Rwanda, even though they formed only about one-tenth of the populace. Their domination was deeply resented by the shorter, stocky Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite their differences, the Tutsi and Hutu speak the same language and share a common culture. Scholars tend to view them as sub-groups of the same ethnic stock. Liberal Rwandese intellectuals from both groups characterize the distinction as one of class, solidified into ethnic hostility by a divide-and-rule Belgian colonial policy that set Tutsi apart as superior to Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Belgium shifted its allegiances, however, when Tutsi leaders began to call for independence in the post-World War II years, and the colonial authorities stood by when the Hutu rebelled in 1959. Thousands of Tutsi were killed, and nearly 600,000 fled to Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority of the Tutsi refugees settled in Uganda, where many found a political home in Uganda's National Resistance Army in the early 1980s. The army, led by Yoweri Museveni, seized power in Uganda in 1986, with thousands of Tutsi in senior military posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When many of those fighters joined the invasion of Rwanda in 1990, the Rwandan government -- and some outside observers as well -- believed that Museveni, now Uganda's president, should have taken steps to discourage or stop the attack. Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana accused Museveni of direct complicity in the rebel action. But Museveni, who was in New York attending a United Nations meeting at the time, denied any foreknowledge or responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tutsi rebels say they launched the invasion to force the government to restore citizenship for 2 million exiled Rwandans and to press Habyarimana for an end to one-party rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The exact number of Rwandan refugees in surrounding countries is a matter of dispute, but Habyarimana's government has refused to allow them to come home, where population density is already the highest in Africa. Within Rwanda, Tutsi still face discrimination, although job and school entry quotas are defended by government authorities as affirmative action steps to correct past inequities against the Hutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A fight that won't die. The 1990 invasion by the RPF went well for a few days, then turned sour. Military chief Fred Rwigyema, who had been a general in the Ugandan Armed Forces, was killed by a sniper's bullet. The charismatic Rwigyema had gained a larger-than-life stature, and his death was a major blow for the front. Within weeks, another tier of commanders was killed in an ambush. By the time I visited Katuna at the end of November 1990, many RPF soldiers had been killed and thousands had been scattered by the counter assault of the Rwandan army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But about this time, Maj. Paul Kagame took command of the RPF. As an officer of the Ugandan army, Kagame had been in the United States enrolled in a military training course when the invasion began. Tall and lanky, with oval-shaped spectacles sitting on a sharp nose, he looks more like an absent-minded professor than a soldier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he arrived on the scene, he pulled together about 2,000 men and holed up for several months in the cold, heavily forested Virunga mountains in northwest Rwanda. By the middle of 1991, he reportedly had rebuilt the RPF to a 15,000-strong force, and morale was high. By the end of that year, a guerrilla army that had been thought defeated began a series of successful raids on government positions. The assaults gave the RPF control of a strip of territory along the Uganda border stretching about 20 miles (32 kilometers) into Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a result, new efforts to find a negotiated solution were begun.  After several months of haggling in the Tanzanian town of Arusha, the two sides agreed to a cease-fire, and the 51-member Organization of African Unity stepped in to monitor the peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite sporadic violations, the cease-fire held until this February, when guerrillas attacked government troops on three fronts. The renewed attacks came, the RPF says, after government- instigated violence left some 400 Tutsi dead in the northern Rwanda district of Gisenyi. The RPF accuses the district head of Habyarimana's ruling party of fomenting the trouble by appealing to old ethnic divisions and fears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rebel leader Kagame says the attacks were necessary &quot;to send a strong signal that we shall not stand by and watch the murder of civilians.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By any measure, the scale of the RPF victories in the February fighting was phenomenal. In just a week of skirmishes, the rebels doubled the territory under their control. The Rwandan government, skeptical the RPF could advance so far without outside help, accused Uganda of sending ground troops, a charge the Ugandans have denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The RPF counters with its own charges that Rwanda is receiving help from French forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Paris says its 800 soldiers are in the country to protect French nationals and that it has begun withdrawing the troops as part of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the French did help in the February fighting, the Rwandan army gained little apparent benefit. John Bagire, the regional RPF commander, says his men easily overran ten government outposts. At several locations we visited, helmets still holding blood from fallen troops lay strewn around.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International is investigating reports of killings of unarmed civilians and government opponents by government troops and of deliberate shootings of captured soldiers by the RPF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In RPF-controlled areas of Rwanda, there is an eerie calm. The rebels have asked all civilians to leave, because they don't want the responsibility of caring for them and they fear infiltrators. Privately, some officers say they hope that as the number of displaced people swells, pressure will grow on Habyarimana to reach a settlement in the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A year ago, Habyarimana ended two decades of one-party control by agreeing to the establishment of a multiparty interim government. In mid-April, the mandate of the transitional government was extended for three months to allow conclusion of the peace talks, which are continuing in Arusha. The main sticking point seems to be the composition of a new 13,000-strong national army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rebels say they are confident a political settlement will be reached, although they seem ready to pursue the fighting if the government refuses to compromise. With a fighting force now approaching 40,000, the movement might well be able to continue the conflict if peace efforts fail. *</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An analysis of Africa, Asia and Latin America reporting broadcast by the &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour&quot; on public television last year and a comparison of National Public Radio's (NPR) coverage of Africa and the former Yugoslavia during January and February of this year show that Africa's 54 nations continue to get short shrift from news decision makers. Africa News Service compiled the information as part of our periodic survey of media treatment of Africa in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the first half of 1992, the &quot;NewsHour&quot; carried more stories on Latin America and almost twice as many on Asia as on Africa. But after President George Bush announced a U.S. airlift to Somalia in August, the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Somalis found a more prominent place in U.S. news lineups generally. Coverage on &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer&quot; skyrocketed, with much of the reporting focusing on U.S. involvement and on American personnel.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From January through June, the &quot;NewsHour&quot; did two reports on Somalia and seven on other African issues. From July through November, the program broadcast 16 reports on Somalia. In December, after U.S. troops were sent in, 19 Somalia stories were aired. Coverage of the rest of Africa dropped to three reports for the final six months of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the first two months of this year, NPR's morning and evening news programs carried 136 reports about the former Yugoslavia. In the same period, NPR did 54 stories on Africa, over half of them about the U.S.-led intervention in Somalia. Twenty- six stories were devoted to other countries on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among the African stories receiving scant attention in the U.S. media are the crisis in Zaire, a mineral-rich nation the size of the United States east of the Mississippi, where a U.S.-installed dictator is resisting popular pressure for democratic change; the famine in southern Sudan, which threatens an estimated 3 million lives; the war in Angola, currently the world's most deadly armed conflict; the fragile peace accord in Mozambique, where United Nations observers are monitoring an end to decades of fighting; and the election campaign in Nigeria, which is one of the largest suppliers of oil to the United States.  n</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) is taking part in an eight-month survey of the Fischer's lovebird, endemic to Tanzania, beginning May 1993.  With large numbers of the Fischer's lovebird having been traded internationally to supply the pet industry, there is concern that this exploitation has seriously depleted wild populations. Collaborating institutions for the study include the World Conservation Union's Species Survival Commission, the Tanzania Department of Wildlife and Tanzania National Parks. This is the first management-oriented field study in Tanzania of a bird species that is traded to a significant extent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I don't think most people realize the FIscher's lovebird, a common pet in the United States and other industrialized countries, may actually be an endangered species in the wild,&quot; said AWF Executive Vice President Diana E. McMeekin. &quot;This survey will give all parties concerned a better idea of the extent of the exploitation in trade that has occurred and a stronger foundation for continued conservation efforts.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The survey will initially focus on the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania where there are known, good and unexploited populations of Fischer's lovebird. The field work will coincide with the breeding season and the dry season. The survey will assess the current status of the bird in Tanzania and estimate a minimum and maximum population size. Researchers, led by ornithologist Dave Moyer, will interview bird trappers and traders in order to determine seasonal movements, aspects of the past trade, such as trapping methods and post trapping mortality levels and the significance of the trade to local economies. The study will also make recommendations for the management and conservation of the bird and establish the framework for a long-term monitoring system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Unites States, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom have imported the Fischer's lovebird (Agapornis ficheri) in the past decade to supply the pet trade. The European community banned the import of the bird from Burundi and Rwanda in 1986 and from Tanzania in 1988. The United States banned the import of Fischer's lovebird in October 1992 under the Wild Bird Conservation Act.  Tanzania began to regulate the trade under a quota system in 1988. In response to continued concerns raised by the Conventions on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), the government enacted a zero annual harvest quota in 1992. Unfortunately, it is probable that illegal trade of the birds continues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The brightly colored Fischer's lovebird, measuring five and one-half inches in length, has a green body, orange forehead, cheeks and throat, and a yellow crown. Usually found in northern Tanzania and occasionally in southern Kenya, the bird travels in flocks in open grasslands, acacia woodland and dry bush country. The sound it makes is a high-pitched whistle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Initial funding for the survey has been provided by two African Wildlife Foundation trustees, Henry P. McIntosh IV and George G. Matthews.  Celebrating more than 30 years of service, the African Wildlife Foundation is the largest American conservation organization working solely in Africa. AWF assists African governments in their struggle to conserve natural resources by funding conservation projects, giving aid to parks and reserves and aiding in conservation education. AWF's newly created Planning and Assessment for Wildlife Management (PAWM) project works with the Tanzania Department of Wildlife on ways to achieve a sustainable, humane and economically sound bird trade. -30NW, Washington, DC 20036.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the continuing influx of Togolese refugees into Benin, the World Food Programme today announced it will provide an additional 5,060 metric tons of food aid to meet the needs of an increased number of refugees requiring assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last two months the number of refugees without adequate shelter and in need of food assistance has dramatically risen, from 40,000 in March to 100,000 todya, according to WFP and UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mounting civil unrest and growing insecurity in Togo, particluarly in the capital Lome, has forced an estimated 400,000 people to flee the country into neighboring Benin and Ghana, or escape up-country. Although many of these refugees and displaced persons are integrated into local families or living with relatives, others are living in churches and temporary shelters and are in dire need of relief assistance.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A joint WPF/UNHCR assessment mission which visited Benin reports that more than 160,000 refugees have entered the country to seek asylum.  About 100,000 of these refugees are in need of emergency assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP -- the food aid organization of the United Nations -- last March approved the supply of 3,600 tons of emergency food aid for 40,000 refugees encamped in the capital, Cotonou, in Porto Novo, and in border cities such as Agoue, Grand-Popo, Lokossa, Athienne and Aplauhoue. The food was sufficient to meet the needs of the refugees for six months but, because of the increase in refugee numbers, the food is not enough and will run out by end of June.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new tranche of food aid -- 4,800 tons of maize, 720 tons of pulses, 300 tons of vegetable oil, 180 tons of sugar and 60 tons of salt -- is enough to cover the needs of 100,000 refugees in Benin for an additional four-month period, from July to the end of October 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP rations will be distributed to the refugees by Caritas and the Benenese Red Cross under the supervision of UNHCR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Ghanam the Programme is already providing 4,500 tons of emergency relief food to 50,000 Togolese refugees settled in the country's border towns between Ho and Kadjebi in the Volta region. -30Mitchell, Public Affairs, Rome, phones: 39-6-5797-5925, 5797-5593, 6-540-2313</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dear Mr. Secretary,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are deeply concerned that the Administration is considering the possibility of lowering financial aid financing for the Development Fund for Africa in order to pay for Russian aid. We are writing to you to express our strong support for maintaining, if not increasing, the funding level for development assistance to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We acknowledge that the U.S. must sacrifice to support the transition to democracy in Russia. But we insist that this sacrifice not come from the DFA, which is already at the minimum acceptable level. Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest region in the world, and has been recognized as the principle development challenge facing the international community today.  Some twenty-five nations in Africa are undertaking transitions to democracy and market economies, similar to the transition underway in Russia. Indeed, Africans share the same aspirations as Russians and look to the United States for support. Since 1988, the DFA has been an effective instrument for programming U.S. support for long-term development in Africa. In this era of political and economic reform, Africa needs DFA resources more than ever, and has greater capacity to use them effectively.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We were extremely pleased that National Security Advisor Anthony Lake chose to make his first formal foreign policy address on Africa. He stated that the Clinton Administration is committed to a serious engagement in Africa. We believe that the credibility of this commitment will be seriously eroded if the funding levels for the DFA are not maintained or increased.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We would like to meet with you as soon as possible to discuss these issues.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LAGOS, NIGERIA -- The Constitutional Rights Project, CRP, has decried the severe restrictions under which the press in Nigeria operate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report entitled, &quot;The Crisis of Press Freedom in Nigeria,&quot; the CRP observed that the press in Nigeria has been a victim of government high-handedness and arbitrariness, especially under military rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CRP report, deriving from a year-long study of the practice of press freedom in Nigeria, listed several cases of harassment, arrest and detention of journalists, forced closure of media houses, promulgation of arbitrary decrees and laws, and the general uncertainty in the practice of journalism, which the CRP says underscores &quot;The Crisis of Press Freedom in Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From December 31, 1983, when the military again intervened in national politics up till the end of 1992 (a period of 7 years), the report cited more than 46 instances of the arrest and detention of journalists.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Report also cited instances of suspension and/or dismissal of journalists in government owned media houses for publishing embarrassing stories or news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CRP also cited the killing by parcel bomb in October 1986 of the founding editor of &quot;Newswatch&quot; Magazine, Dele Giwa, as a violent attack on the practice of journalism in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further attacks on the press cited in the report include the closure of newspaper houses. In 1990 alone, more than five newspapers/magazines were shut down by the military government, while two media houses were closed in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Prominent among closed media houses listed in the report include &quot;The Guardian,&quot; &quot;Vanguard,&quot; &quot;Punch,&quot; &quot;Lagos News,&quot; &quot;Champion,&quot; &quot;Concord,&quot; &quot;Newswatch&quot; and &quot;Newbreed Magazine.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Report particularly criticized the trend under the military of curtailing press freedom. CRP investigations published in this report also showed that the statutory provisions relating to protection of press freedom are inadequate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Report examined the constitutional provisions on human rights and criticized the failure of the Nigerian Constitution to specifically guarantee press freedom, contrary to the recommendation of the Political Bureau set up by the military government to articulate popular opinion on Nigeria's future political direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On censorship, CRP's report observed that while there is no prior censorship of the press in Nigeria, the restriction on the activities of the press through the arrests and detention of journalists and the closure of media houses has induced a pattern of self-censorship, inimical to free reporting of events and news.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CRP criticized the structure of ownership of the mass media in Nigeria, which it said is a limiting factor to the flow of information; particularly with government ownership of all the more than 80 electronic broadcasting stations in the country. The Report commended the plurality of print media in Nigeria, describing it as impressive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report called for the abrogation of restrictive laws on the press, naming specifically the Official Secrets Act of 1962, and the provision of the Criminal and Penal Codes on sedition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While commending the liberalization of the ownership of electronic media, the Report called for an amendment to the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission Decree No. 38 of 1992, which authorizes the ownership of private broadcasting stations, with a view to expunging from its text the provision authorizing the minister of Information to give directives to the commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> CRP's Report further called for specific constitutional restraint against government and security agencies forbidding the closure of media houses, while journalists accused of violating the law should be treated in accordance with the process which requires prompt and fair trial before competent courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Nigeria seeks to achieve democracy for its people, there is the need to promote openness and deplore secrecy &quot;in the conduct of all forms of official business,&quot; the report added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, CRP described the current state of press freedom in Nigeria, as falling very much below the standards set by the international bill of rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and stated that the need to redress this shortcoming is an urgent task for the government and people of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

First, it is estimated that women are de facto heads of nearly a third of households worldwide; secondly, women play an increasingly economic role in human settlements, though they are the lowest paid workers in the formal sector. What remains a constant, and forms the anchor for the two phenomena, is the traditional role of women as the pivot of the household.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In all these areas, and their accompanying roles and responsibilities, men and women experience and react differently -- with different priorities and needs. Significantly, women spend a greater proportion of their earnings on the family; so when women work, children enjoy better food health care and education.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Furthermore, the improved income and education that results from shelter improvement can influence women in bringing down birth rates. In a nutshell, urban development needs to focus on women because the multiplicity of roles that women play in human settlements lends itself to the all-embracing concept of sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite their new roles, women still spend the greatest amount of time in the house. What, however, needs attention are the new kinds of economic activities that are now carried on in the house by women who are sole income earners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> House design and layout of settlements are of crucial importance to the multifarious roles that women play today. For example, in hot climates, women may want large verandas where they can combine an income-generating activity like sewing or retailing with child-minding activities. The provision of child-care facilities within the settlement also frequently determines the women's ability to work outside the home as opposed to being forced to accept exploitative subcontracting work. So also, they may prefer plots to be grouped around services so that domestic work can be socialized.  The layout of settlements is especially important in societies where services inhibit the free movement of women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Urban Services</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in this traditional role of being concerned with the maintenance and running of the household and community, that women are in a position to offer advice and insights into the delivery of urban services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the micro level, this could include the choice and location of waterpumps. Waterpump handles have been broken because they had been designed for men. Women and children could not use them correctly. For example, the siting of toilets needs to be such that they meet the needs of women for privacy. Similarly, women are invariably in charge of the refuse disposal of the household and their involvement in garbage collection and disposal schemes can contribute immeasurable to a physically cleaner environment and to elimination of much wastage and inefficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women voluntarily come to the forefront where basic services (like water and sewerage) and social services are concerned. In Lima, Peru, though men were the main leaders of the BARRIO committee, women arranged special marches to claim the right to have water connections. The efficacy of women's committees, despite male dominance in matter of political participation, was greater for a variety of reasons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For instance, while the women's committee was assigned health education, food and child welfare, the men concerned themselves with the &quot;big problems&quot; -- getting pipelines installed, electricity and the committee's political affiliations. As a study of the area notes, &quot;There was a surprise for the men in this neatest of arrangements. The men's possibilities were almost nil, whereas the women, with less global problems assigned to their sphere, were in a good position to achieve results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This division of labour by gender often leads to the most effective attempts being undertaken by women in sustainable local development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Promoting Health</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women are important actors in the health arena, which has also been their responsibility. This thrust on women as the focus of health, education and awareness was tried out in the Orangi Pilot Project, in Karachi, Pakistan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the Director's Annual Report (1984/85) states: &quot;In the success of the Low Cost Sanitation Programme, housewives had played an active role.  Their participation provided us with a clue to the future direction of women's programmes. That women were very conscious of the problems of health and hygiene is borne out by the fact that they paid the sanitation cost from household expenses.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women, however, by custom, stayed at home, which created problems of access. This was sought to be overcome by the &quot;street vendor&quot; approach composed of mobile training teams. They provided leaflets and training about prevention of diseases common in Orangi like diarrhea, malaria and scabies.  They also offered immunization of children against diseases as well as further training about sanitation and hygiene. The results of this approach speak for themselves. Preliminary investigations in September 1986 revealed that many families had been totally free from disease during the preceding six months. Further, the incidence of serious diseases had been considerably reduced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Generating Income</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> New policy initiatives have to consider women in their productive capacity despite their mostly unrecognized and low visibility role in the urban economy. In several export processing zones, women form over two-thirds of the work force. However, their participation in the formal sector is often marginalized because they are passive, or non-unionized or simply because they suffer from the traditional bias, being viewed by employers as second income earners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The situation is likely to get more difficult. Growing urban populations are giving rise to increasing employment pressures. Governments that address this problem, however, now have the potential to create innovative and imaginative approaches to women that will have a crucial impact on long-term development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As income generators, women need to have policies directed specifically towards them rather than the usual identification of employment opportunities with men. Entrepreneurship, or indeed any income-earning capacity, should be seen as a profit-making activity rather than a subsidiary poverty-alleviation programme within the framework of community welfare.  Productivity should be as important a focus as poverty alleviation. For this, women need equal address to savings and credit facilities and training in management, marketing and pricing. Besides, there is evidence that credit schemes favouring women have a good cost-recovery record.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Need for Change</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In their societal and familiar roles the critical issue for women is the right to land tenure and property ownership. This has social, economic and cultural implications which allow women to lead independent lives befitting their status of being responsible for their families. Security of tenure gives women the ability to protect themselves against domestic violence; to shake off the tag of being the dependent of a man; to use it as collateral for gaining access to credit; and the choice to view land as a form of saving which appreciates over time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From this starting point, women can come into their own and create the kind of lives that they have tried to achieve over many centuries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Women should not be viewed as passive victims of society who need to be protected and sheltered by social welfare programmes. Rather, the necessary social and economic conditions should be created which encourage them to go out and become equal members of the urban workforce. The urban phenomenon has created a situation where the possibilities of change and progress are enormous. It has helped break some of the barriers keeping women from achieving their full potential as creators and sustainers of growth.  This opportunity needs to be taken to develop policies that will build on this trend and take full advantage and capitalize on their unique role in society in the path to sustainable development. --United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) -30</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this era of staggering debt imposed on The Gambia, there is no quick-fix solution to agricultural development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Government, since independence, has not centered its agricultural development policy on cash cropping, but on food crop production to meet the basic food needs of the cross section of the populace. Today The Gambia is nearly self-sufficient in food, but the country experiences an approximate 50% deficit in cereals. There is a need to increase food crop production, raise the nutritional status of Gambians and better meet the food requirements of the population.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To combat food deficits, crops which are high-yielding varieties should be introduced into our husbandry practices. Provision of abundant food can be assured through the use of improved crop varieties and appropriate technology. The introduction of high-yielding varieties requires intensive application of agrochemicals such as fertilizers, herbicides, insecticides, pesticides, etc. Fertilizer promotion, distribution and credit assistance, would need to be accelerated to combat the food deficit. These efforts are necessary so that agricultural production and productivity can be increased and the national objective of attaining a high degree of self sufficiency in food can be achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The green revolution, which has lead to the introduction of plant breeding and seed multiplication, has raised hopes that hunger can be combatted with the application of scientific know-how. High-yielding varieties, which are often early-maturing, will increase productivity when introduced and fully adopted as extension packages. Most of our traditional grains are adapted to our environment, but due to environmental degradation and population growth, our situation now calls for the cultivation of crops which are high-yielding varieties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In The Gambia, the sahelian drought has lead to the introduction of many improved varieties of rice, maize, millet and sorghum, most of which are drought tolerant. Traditional grains, which are naturally selected for our ecosystem, should be maintained. They are more adapted to the environment and resist flooding and other unfavorable climactic conditions than most improved crop varieties. -30</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until now the National Party's (NP) opposition, especially the African National Congress (ANC), has been confident of ousting the ruling party in the first democratic elections in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most ANC members assume their organisation's popularity will carry them to certain victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However, a closer reading of the mounting evidence, including opinion polls, registration issues and the mechanics of any electoral process, leave the observer with the growing impression that the ANC's march to victory in a one-person, one-vote election will certainly not be an effortless on,&quot; says Andrew Reynolds, who authored &quot;Voting for a New South Africa&quot; while teaching and studying for a year at UCT.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It is in fact quite likely that President F.W. de Klerk of the National Party, with his allies, may well have the support and do the unthinkable and actually win a non-racial, democratic election in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If my readings and estimates are even a close approximation of the actual state of play, then the party which designed and operated apartheid (the NP) could well form a majority government elected by many of the very people they systematically discriminated against for over 40 years.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Polling experts describe the scientific methods used by Reynolds to arrive at this conclusion on the outcome of the election as &quot;very</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">sophisticated:.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;From the evidence I have found it seems clear that the NP under F.W. de Klerk will do much better electorally than many people have presumed, possibly even being in a position to lead a coalition government and hold the majority of seats in a constituent assembly,&quot; Reynolds argues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At the present time there is an uneven playing field, with virtually all the advantages of political organization -- financial strength, electoral experience and media control -- lying with the NP.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reynolds also says the NP government itself has gone into the electoral process with the belief that while it hoped to win a substantial block in parliament, they would not &quot;win&quot; the election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;However, the surprise may come from the fact that they will dramatically out-poll the expectations...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;De Klerk has largely managed to dissociate himself from former government architects if apartheid and many South Africans see him as a reformer and politician of the future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, the propensity for electoral irregularities, subtle or overt, is high in South Africa and the country has a large, rural more conservative and less educated population.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reynolds based his assessment of the factors influencing the election outcome on analysis of, among other things, identity documents and electoral registration, the effect of illiteracy on voter turnout, the effect of political violence and intimidation and the strength and abilities of the major parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He calculates that 28 percent of potentially eligible black South Africans will be disenfranchised due to lack of proof of age or citizenship and that might alter the electorate in favour of the &quot;non-black&quot; communities (white, coloureds and Indians).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While over 30 percent of South Africans -- at least 42 percent of blacks -- are illiterate, Reynolds argues that the turnout of the illiterate voters is usually 10 percent less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes the levels of intimidation and violence will be higher in the TBVC states, particularly Ciskei and Bophuthatswana, &quot;because they are areas containing millions of potential ANC voters controlled by regimes overtly hostile to the ANC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His &quot;guesstimate&quot; is that up to 16 percent of black voters might fail to turn out if high levels of violence and intimidation manifest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The variables are seen as favouring a high turnout of NP supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Based on recent surveys and projections, Reynolds gave the ANC a 40.6 percent majority of support, the NP 30 percent (including 75 percent of coloureds), the Inkatha Freedom Party 11.5 percent (arguing that the party's support is undermeasured) and a right-wing alliance 5.7 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rest, including the DP, might not acquire the necessary five percent for parliamentary representation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But he stresses that the 10 percent majority the ANC might get could be completely eroded by the above variables.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To arrive at the conclusion that the NP could win the next elections, Reynolds used scientific methods employed in other countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He employed constructions used by Samuel Huntington in his book, &quot; The Third Wave&quot;, which might be too narrow for South Africa's complexity.  However, Reynolds argues that they are appropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Huntington said the first democratic election after a period of authoritarian rule almost always produces a result which surprises and stuns pundits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reynolds believes South Africa shows some distinct similarities to the variables which influenced Huntington's analysis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Firstly, the new leaders distanced themselves from the former authoritarian rulers; secondly, coercion, fraud and electoral irregularities played a part in the former regime's victory.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the countries concerned were largely rural/peasant societies lacking a large urban middle class which is usually a prerequisite for opposition victory in such first democratic elections. -30</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Nelson Mandela had to visit and give pep talks to various African National Congress departments this week in order to boost morale. The combined effect of the deaths of two senior leaders, Oliver Tambo and Chris Hani, the violence of the past fortnight and the slowness of negotiations were taking their toll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a tribute to the standing of ANC national chairman and former president Tambo that his death was still felt so acutely by the organization, despite his having been precluded by ill health from the hurly-burly of politics for four years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was partly because Tambo's death represented the end of an era. The gentlemanly, old-school arch-diplomat was the living embodiment of the ANC-in-exile. Tambo's personal style combined firm principle, unbending determination and an old-worldly grace that came to characterize the ANC as a whole -- and is inevitably changing as the ANC prepares to take part in government.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The shock in the ANC can also be attributed to the man's popularity. From battle-seasoned Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) guerrillas, through jail-hardened cadres to the gray-suited negotiations team, one struggles to find ANC members who do not express heartfelt respect for the an who led the organization during 30 years of difficult and bitter exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This should come as a surprise, because he was better known as a diplomat than a military leader. It was in the field of diplomacy -- gaining international acceptance for the ANC and isolating the Pretoria government -- that his achievements were enormous. He will be remembered most of all for his meetings with world leaders, his protg Thabo Mbeki almost always at his side, slowly and graciously working to undermine Western resistance to the ANC's links with the Communist Party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it was this manner -- and his unquestioned integrity -- that won over arch-critics in white South Africa during the first contacts with the establishment in the critical years of 1985 to 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, MK leaders, like Ronnie Kasrils, say that Tambo was loved my MK cadres because he showed unwavering commitment to their role and skillfully managed the delicate balance between military and political struggle. He often visited the camps and kept track of the details of military strategy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But it is his political leadership and strategic planning that stand out. He was the person who, when the black consciousness upsurge of the 1970s threatened the ANC, convinced the organization it must adapt and reach out to these people, rather than see them as political competitors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it was he who campaigned, in crucial meetings in the late 1980s with United States Secretary of State George Schultz and Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev, to take the South African struggle outside the context of the Cold War, which had deadlocked talks over Namibia and Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tambo's greatest achievement was in ensuring that during the long and traumatic years of exile, when progress was hard to demonstrate, the ANC never suffered from the kinds of debilitating splits that characterized most other liberation movements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There were periods in which his leadership, style and policy faced serious challenges from below. The first was in the late 1960s, after the failure of the Wankie campaign, the ANC's first major military push.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was a mark of Tambo's hands-on style that he traveled to the Zambian border with his troops to bid them farewell as they crossed into the then-Rhodesia and headed south for home in 1967.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And when the campaign failed dismally, bringing to a head frustration and discontent within the ANC, he summoned the Morogoro conference of 1969 to try to keep the organization united. That conference led to the formation of the ANC's revolutionary council, which brought together political and military leadership to plan future strategy, and opened the doors of the ANC to non-blacks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was followed by the breakaway of what became known as the &quot;group of eight,&quot; a core of nationalists that challenged the Morogoro decisions. Tambo summoned what became known as the &quot;conference in the bush,&quot; which brought all the key ANC leaders together in the Zambian countryside to thrash out the problem and keep the organization in one piece.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At both these meetings, Tambo and his associates faced harsh criticism from below and direct challenged to their leadership. At both, he heard out his opponents, responded and held on to the reins of authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was his style: to listen a lot, to seek conciliation, to understand his critics and to accommodate them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was also his weakness. He kept the organization together because of his consensus-seeking style of leadership, but it also meant he had enormous tolerance and seldom cracked the organizational whip.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If someone misbehaved or broke the rules, Tambo would always try to talk them round and rehabilitate them. Sometimes we wondered why he never came down harder on them,&quot; one of his closest colleagues said this week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That was why anyone who visited the ANC in Lusaka during the 1980s found an amiable and friendly organization, marred by elements of gross inefficiency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it accounts for the great black mark in Tambo's leadership</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">history: his failure to stop the abuses in ANC camps in Angola. There is now little doubt that even when he knew about the conditions in the camps, he did not use the authority he enjoyed to make sure that they came to an end and the culprits were punished -- a major error that is still plaguing the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has also been criticized for the fact that Operation Vula, the major attempt to reestablish an ANC underground after the Nkomati Accord drove the organization out of neighboring states, came so late. In the end, it was his political work that counted, but a stronger military position and a stronger underground could have changed the balance of power before the 1990 un-banning of the ANC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was often slow to decide and was given to careful consideration, detailed planning and lengthy discussion rather than swift action. Mbeki, who was almost always at Tambo's side during the 1980s, described him spending many hours thinking through problems, making extensive notes and ensuring he came to meetings with carefully prepared positions and strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He was not that good at reading prepared speeches, but he was excellent when he spoke off the cuff. People often wondered how he was able to speak so fluently and so carefully when he cast aside his notes. But then they didn't know that he would have spent three days writing the speech, so he knew exactly what and how he wanted to say it,&quot; Mbeki says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tambo's style stands in marked contrast to Mandela's stronger, more direct leadership. Where Tambo sought consensus, Mandela seeks support for decisions he has already made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tambo was, Kasrils says, a workaholic and expected the same of those around him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also had an element of the purist. Tambo never drank -- except during a visit to Cuba in 1987, when Fidel Castro insisted he toast the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">revolution with rum. He closed his eyes, threw it back and later remarked: &quot;That was very nice.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also often told a story of the first time he ever wore shoes, as a Transkei child. At the age of nine, he found a pair of shoes which he put on to walk the great distance to his home. He found it difficult, but put this down to inexperience. It was only when he got home, blistered and sore, that his mother pointed out they were high-heeled women's shoes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The picture that emerges is of drive and determination that saw him through a difficult childhood and the many sacrifices of exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This came partly from a driving sense of mission: his closest friend, Mandela, had gone to prison for the cause and it was only luck that had Tambo selected as the organization's external representative, enabling him to avoid prison -- something that plagued him over all those years.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Frene Ginwala: &quot;He would often say in difficult times, 'I have been given a task and nothing is going to stop me from fulfilling it.'&quot; Tambo died last week, aged 75, knowing that that task -- the achievement of nonracial democracy -- was nearly, but not quite, complete.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mohammed Joji is probably having his roughest time since he became the managing director of Nigeria Airways January 1992. Although Joji has been battling a number of formidable outside forces, his first in-house battle came in February when the board gave him a query.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The board wanted to know how he spent a federal government loan of $64 million (about N2.1 billion on the autonomous market rate), which the government advanced the airline to bail it out. Formal application for the loan was made in April 1992 although Joji and his team of financial advisers had been talking to government officials about it much earlier. Details of the disbursements show that the money was released between January and December much earlier than eve when the formal application was made. Many board members did not seem to have been aware of when the money was collected and how it was spent. The board now asked for details of how the money was approved and spent. Joji and Afam Nwagboso, his director of finance, were asked to furnish the board with documents showing the amounts and dates the money was released, the sequence of disbursements, the beneficiaries and what the airline benefited from the payments.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The concern of the board is to establish on whose authority Joji expended the money which is far in excess of the N500,000.00 limit of expenditure for the airline's managing director. He has since filed his reply to the board. In it, Joji documented the expenditure and said the money was disbursed, not by him, but by a subcommittee appointed by the government of which he was a member.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The money, he said, was given to the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, MOFI, which disbursed it directly to the airline's creditors through the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Central Bank. Said Joji: &quot;The $64 million loan was given to MOFI.  Government said that every kobi spent must be accounted for to MOFI even before the board. Everything was properly documented and I have given that to the board, to the federal government and to the TCPC.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he applied for the load, Joji said the bail was &quot;needed urgently to enable the part payment of Nigeria Airways' long overdue operating debts, together with the accomplishment of urgent heavy maintenance that is necessary to enable the airline's aircraft to resume or continue operation in an air worthy condition.&quot; The loan covers a period of five years with a 20 percent interest. The condition which Joji built into the request was that in event of privatisation of Airways the loan will either be repaid directly from the proceeds or from the dividend to be generated by the new airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the negotiation for the loan, Tony Momoh, Airways chairman and member of the disbursement subcommittee provided adequate support for Joji.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The account presented by Nwagboso to the board shows that the key beneficiaries of the loan included NICON, which got $10 million on April 1, 1992 to cover the insurance premium for the airline and another $2.94 million on December 17. Equator Bank, according to the statement, received a total of #3.02 million in three installments on January 21, September 13 and October 5. Equator leasing got $12.75 million in 15 installments between January 21 and November 26. Air Lingus, the Irish firm which maintains Airways' Boeing 737, got $8.34 million in three installments on November 11, 26 and December 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other beneficiaries included Sabena Techniques, $109 million, Shire Fuel, $1.97 million; Varig, $7.3 million; Jet Aerospace $494,464.08 and Aviation Equipment, $304,000. Those who challenge Joji on these figures do so apparently because the board was not in the picture when the money was spent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An official of Jet and Aerospace, a Miami-based firm said he doubted strongly this expenditure, because no serious effort was made to ascertain the debts in the first place. &quot;Early last year, a foreign company offered to assist in verifying creditors claim on Nigerian Airways. The idea was to challenge some of those claims that were frivolous. One Saturday, we had a meeting where $7 million was ascertained as Nigeria Airways indebtedness to Sabena, although engines, rotables and parts valued at about $32 million were being held by Sabena.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said that before the team which included Jet Aerospace officials, Keith Bolshaw and Joji reached Brussels the next Monday, the content of the meeting was leaked to Sabena. Airways debt jumped to $11 million. &quot;Some rotables and engines were later released by Sabena to Nigeria Airways. Since then, Bolshaw took over the negotiations. One month after, Airways' indebtedness went up to $27 million.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jet and Aerospace said it offered its services free. But it is also known that it had a major contract with Airways at the inception of Joji's management but fell out of favour with the airline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What is happening, Joji says, is a calculated blackmail because he opted to play differently. &quot;Supposing I received the $64 million loan and I say let me wash a few hands, let me take $10 million here and there, you will not hear any story. It is because there was ethics and morality attached to the expenditure of that money and that the people are doing all these. The people who gave it to me trusted me.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Momoh refuses to comment on the issue. &quot;The thing is not whether the federal government gave Nigeria Airways a loan or whether the federal government guaranteed any loan for Nigeria Airways. I cannot discuss the loan the federal government gave to Nigeria Airways or guaranteed to Nigeria Airways. The loan profile of a company is the internal affairs of that company.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joji has another problem, and this is his link with Air Nigeria, the airline he largely put together with the help of Bolshaw, a Briton, under the auspices of the Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation, TCPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aviation officials have become very skeptical of the project and the rush with which it is being implemented, even without necessary government approvals. Joji has been fingered as the culprit. A top government official even spoke of &quot;a hidden agenda&quot; in the implementation process of Air Nigeria package. That point, the official said, is strongly buttressed by the fact that there has been a deliberate campaign of disinformation on what has become perhaps the most difficult job for TCPC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Nigeria is planned for inauguration on May 21, to coincide with the commencement of summer and the high traffic season. At least, it makes good business sense that promoters of Nigeria's new continental carrier want to position their baby in the market at a time of immense traffic prospects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the problem which promoters of the new airline are beginning to realise is that plans, no matter the beauty, do not always translate into reality. From indications, Air Nigeria, for months a dream, may at best remain just a dream. The new airline is trapped in an intricate web of pre-natal complications which may prove fatal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among its promoters -- the Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation, TCPC, the sharp division which surfaced in January over modalities for implementing the privatisation programme has deepened. Hamza Zayyad, TCPC chairman and Omowale Kuye, the secretary who also heads TCPC's subcommittee on the privatisation of Nigeria Airways, have been at loggerheads</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">for most of the year. Their disagreement is over what should come first: government's approval or pre-emptive action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zayyad's anger is that Kuye and his team have since exceeded the brief. The team which included Tony Momoh, chairman of Nigeria Airways and Joji, as well as Keith Bolshaw, a Briton and consultant to TCPC on Airways privatisation, were mandated to negotiate with prospective investors and to select a core foreign investor for the project. But it went further by assembling a start-up team at a time when government had not approved the plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, up-till last week, government's only approval to TCPC's plans had been on how to privatize the airways. Emeka why it chose Air Nigeria as better privatisation option. These are the debts problem of Nigeria Airways, the non-availability of audited accounts on which the capital market could determine the company's share price, the inefficient administrative and operational procedures which are not easily amenable to change and the need to develop an entirely new organization to provide efficient, reliable and profitable service. The other reason was the need to create an international airline of repute and by so doing, provide a conducive climate for aviators to fully develop their talents.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TCPC relied heavily on the report of the Presidential Task Force, PTF, which government set up to prepare the national carrier for privatisation. The PTF had recommended the Airways be privatized through asset deconsolidation. This was to involve the creation of two companies-Aircraft Operating Company and Aircraft Leasing Company. The first TCPC committee headed by Arthur Mbanefo studies this proposal and among the options it recommended was the liquidation of the company and the establishment of a brand new carrier.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It wasn't until Joji arrived the scene, that he, assisted by Bolshaw, worked with the TCPC to package the present arrangement. The privately run Air Nigeria would take charge of international operations while what remains of Nigeria Airways will be collapsed into a small airline to fly local and West African routes. It would be wholly owned by government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Nigeria will lease three planes-one DC-10-30 and two Airbus A310 from Nigeria Airways. At the moment, two DC-10s and three A310 are serviceable in the fleet. The DC-10 will be leased at $400,000 per month while the Airbuses will attract a monthly lease of $300,000. Air Nigeria will also take over all of Nigeria Airways overseas assets in stations like London, New York, Rome, Jeddah and Amsterdam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposal was a clear contradiction of the National Civil Aviation Policy which government approved and released in 1990. The policy states clearly that Nigeria Airways should be broken into two, one for domestic and the other for international operations. While the domestic carrier should be wholly government-owned. The essence, a member of the committee which drafted the policy said, was to ensure that the lucrative international operation was left to the government. He cited the example of Ethiopian Airline which is wholly-owned by government and is Ethiopia's number one foreign exchange earner. &quot;Why the government turned around and did another thing, I cannot say,&quot; the member told NEWSWATCH.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Except for British Airways and American Airlines which are privately-owned, most foreign airlines are owned by governments and they become not only symbols of strength and vitality but a source of economic nourishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But only a few are really disturbed by this fact. The worry at the moment is that the privatisation process is moving at a pace which only a few can understand. Many are in the dark about what is happening, and those who have an inkling are challenging it. Wole Adeosun, secretary for transport is said to have challenged Kuye on the way the privatisation is going. Adeosun is said to be unhappy that a sick baby like Nigeria Airways is trying to give birth to a baby itself. According to NEWSWATCH sources, he also objects to the purported recruitment of staff going on in Air Nigeria. Adeosun's colleagues in the Transitional Council are equally unaware. A meeting of the council has been planned for next week to discuss the issue of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Air Nigeria. Said a member of the Transitional Council last week: &quot;People behind Air Nigeria are moving faster than they can run. We really need to know more about what is happening.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH gathered that officials of the transport and communications ministry are worried about what is happening in Nigeria Airways and Air Nigeria, and some have initiated moves to get the government to review the entire implementation process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ministry officials are concerned that the TCPC is milking Nigeria Airways to bring forth its baby. For instance, all the consultants and members of the start-up team are being sustained by Nigeria Airways. When the team arrived, they were initially lodged at Hotel Eko L'Meridien on which the airline spent more than N300,000. Later, it hired an official accommodation for the newly recruited personnel at about N4.5 million in Ikeja. Number 26 Glover Road, Ikoyi, which is officially the residence of the managing director of Airways, has been turned into a guest house where a number of the consultants are lodged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Air Nigeria office, Eagle House, located within Nigeria Airways headquarters was originally build as the airline's catering block. Said a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ministry official: &quot;Nigeria Airways facility is being used to run Air Nigeria. It is not with the approval of the ministry. We cannot use the assets of a sick baby to set up a new one.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Momoh's responses beclouds the real situation. Wen the board met in February, the members had noted that the Airways resources were being used to support Air Nigeria. Four committees were constituted to handle matters relating to the privatisation and commercialisation of Air Nigeria/Nigeria Airways. The key resolution of the board was to ascertain how much of Nigeria Airways facilities and resources were being used for Air Nigeria and identify those that would be needed, and thereafter work out the costs and modalities for meeting them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In fact, until that meeting, most members of the board were in the dark on the developments that were bound to crush their organization. The board also queried the role of Bolshaw whom it hired in January on the recommendation of Joji as a consultant &quot;on any aviation matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Momoh had, in the letter summoning the meeting, alleged that Airways was being killed to raise up Air Nigeria, and that Bolshaw's role as consultant to Air Nigeria was akin to hiring one's own killers. But by the time the meeting ended, the board noted that Bolshaw had been of immense help to the airline especially in debt negotiation and renegotiation of unfavorable contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, members left the meeting unaware of what was really happening. With a board ignorant of what is happening and a management team that was equally ignorant, it was not surprising that staff of the airline were similarly in the dark. Although the start-up team took up positions in the airline since February, communication with the various sectors of the airline only came on April 23 when Kuye spend seven hours explaining the concept and implementation of the Air Nigeria program to the board, management and union representatives in the airline. Some senior Nigeria Airways official said Kuye's briefing is a panic measure. &quot;In Nigeria, you know when somebody comes to brief you on a second thought, you know there is something wrong.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But is there something wrong with Air Nigeria? It seems so. It seems that the cart has been placed before the horse and a deliberate climate of disinformation has been created to keep the mix-up covered. First, there is at the moment, no known owner of Air Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Neither the government, nor the foreign investors -- Swiss Air and Sabena -- nor private airline operators have subscribed to the airline. The TCPC document which will commit government to the deal is yet to be signed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the memorandum of understanding between Swiss Air and government has not been signed, and it seems unlikely that it well be, given the objections Zayyad has to its contents. The document is essentially a marketing alliance between Swiss Air and Air Nigeria reflecting &quot;mutual desire to form a relationship of close cooperation between the two airlines for all services operated between Nigeria and Europe in the case of Air Nigeria, and between Switzerland and West Africa in the case of Swiss Air.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although Swiss Air offers to provide &quot;one or more individuals to liaise with the designated representative&quot; of government on sourcing, interviewing and engagement of suitably qualified candidates, it shall be &quot;acting solely on a goodwill basis and will incur no liability, expense or obligation.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A draft of the public announcement attached to the document says: &quot;Although Swiss Air will not initially be an equity participant in Air Nigeria, the Federal Republic of Nigeria has accepted Swiss Air's request that the allocation of shares be arranged in a manner that will enable Swiss Air to participate in future on pre-agreed terms.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The announcement was billed to be made on January 18, but up till now, it has not, perhaps reflecting the lack of government's approval.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Similarly, the company which is planning to launch its maiden flight on May 21, is yet to secure its certificate of incorporation. At the Corporate Affairs commission last week, NEWSWATCH, was told that the registration paper of the airline was still being processed and the certificate is awaiting the signature of the registrar-general.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, application was only made last week for an air operating license, AOL. The request did not follow the laid down guidelines. The application, made on a Nigeria Airways letterhead, simply requested the Federal Civil Aviation Authority, FCAA, to issue an AOL for Air Nigeria. FCAA officials said they can only be issued a provisional license until formal request is made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Necessary review in the relevant bilateral air services agreements, BASA, have not been made to legally designate the new airline as the operator of the BASA. Logistic arrangements have not been made on the routes where the new airline will operate. With these lapses, it seems only reasonable that the airline may be heading for a bumpy ride, it is manages to take off, May 21.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It seems that the people have committed themselves to a timetable and they are doing everything to follow it,&quot; said a government official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An aviation chief said last week that the best thing to do was to first resolve the issues of ownership and funding before the fake-off. Said a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">British Airways official: &quot;Honestly, we do not know the owners of Air Nigeria.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Another airline executive spoke similarly when he asked: &quot;Who owns Air Nigeria? Is it the government? Is Swiss Air involved? Who brought these white people parading themselves as Swiss Air staff? Who is funding all that is going on now? Do not turn to Zayyad, for he probably has no answer. He would only answer on the source of funding.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Swiss Air had agreed to pay $12 million as advanced route royalty covering three to five years. Sabena on its part offered to pay the same amount. But its money would come by way of maintenance on Nigeria Airways Airbus fleet. So far, Swiss Air has paid the royalty and the money has not been received by TCPC. Zayyad told an official last week he wanted to know who received the money and who authorized the expenditures so far made for the start-up team. That is his other area of quarrel with Kuye and Joji whom he believes are the people running the show without his nor government's authorization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Joji and Kuye insist that Swiss Air is involved in what is</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">happening at the moment. Said Joji: &quot;If they (Swiss Air)_ tell you that they are not involved, why do they have Avicom here? What they have said is, 'let us come and set it (Air Nigeria) and monitor it to see of it is viable.  Then we will be ready to pay at a higher price.'&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is different from what he told senior pilots of the airline March 5. Then he said that Swiss Air as a company was not directly involved with the nucleus of Air Nigeria or with the formation of an interim management which is provided by a private consultancy firm. He also told them that Sabena and other interested investors had so far not taken up equity.  Between the two foreign airlines and Air Nigeria, what exists is a mere technical agreement, which can be entered into with any reputable firm, but which has been given a different coloration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Airways technical crew which met after Joji's March 5 address paint a rather sad picture of the situation at Air Nigeria. &quot;The present situation is an administration devoid of checks and balances of either a limited or public liability company. No shareholders, no board, no established terms of reference of executives, no performance projections, no conditions of service. Just absolute power to hire and fire at will. That is indeed strange.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joji has consistently said he does not take decisions for air Nigeria as that is the duty of TCPC. &quot;Whatever TCPC wants to do, it has a right to do. I am not a member of TCPC and cannot decide for them.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria Airways -- many years ago -- was a lone ranger in Nigeria's domestic routes. As the oil boom came and many Nigerians could afford to fly instead of drive, the richer ones bought themselves some sleek jets, but those of us who had to fly had to depend on Nigeria Airways.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this time flying was often a tearful event. You had to crawl and beg to buy a boarding pass. Why? Because the aircraft were few but the passengers were many, too many for the aircraft available. Nigeria Airways was trying to service the domestic route of which it had near total monopoly and also to run a race against the foreign airlines that dominated the international route. It never quite achieved both aims successfully. It ended up not exploiting its strength on the domestic route and not priming itself sufficiently for the foreign route.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as the passengers cried out, complaining of the inefficiency of the national airline and the hardship it imposed on them, the sky opened up and we saw new airlines coming up, taking off and landing. Now Nigeria Airways began to have a competitor, then competitors and more competitors on the domestic route. The airline improved in its efficiency, which gave more room to the other airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then the structural adjustment programme came with the Babangida administration restructuring the economy and public institutions. Many of the government's water-in-a-basket parastatals had to be asked to brace up, to commercialise and privatise to meet the demands of a free market economy. The Nigeria Airways had to be broken up into several companies, one of which would do domestic operations while the other would test its wings in the foreign route. But there seems to be a pall of doubt arising from the paucity of information on how that exercise is going.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Is there Air Nigeria? Who owns it? Who runs it? How are the staff recruited and from where? Who is recruiting them? Is the government aware of what is going on? Is the Technical Committee on Privatisation and Commercialisation (TCPC) aware of what's happening? What is the role of the ministry of communications and transport?

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa, traditionally a low priority region for American foreign policy makers, will not be overlooked by the Clinton administration, Anthony Lake, the president's national security advisor, said in his first foreign policy address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The White House &quot;is exploring means to assist Africa's economic reforms and economic growth&quot; and to ease Africa's debt burden, Lake told African ambassadors at a Brookings Institution luncheon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An inter-agency panel has approved a new debt relief initiative that would write-off official debts from about 18 countries, administration sources say, although details are being withheld pending consultations with Congress. Impoverished countries in good standing with the International Monetary Fund would be eligible for the forgiveness of Export Import Bank loans, debts on purchases of military hardware, and outstanding housing guarantees and credits, the officials say.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake said the choice of Africa as the topic for his first speech since being named the president's chief foreign policy advisor was intentional. &quot;There has been a sense that some administrations have taken years to figure out where Africa is on the map,&quot; he said. The Clinton team not only knows &quot;where Africa is,&quot; he said, but wants to contribute to &quot;where it is going&quot; and to craft a &quot;new relationship&quot; built upon the rapid movement towards democracy on the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acknowledging that global changes in Europe and Asia capture more attention, Lake hailed the fact that more than a dozen African countries have held multi-party elections since 1989, while another fifteen are expected to vote before the year's end. Plans for elections in South Africa, he said, &quot;provide real hope that we may soon see what once seemed so remote, the end of apartheid and the arrival of non-racial democracy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The administration's interest in the movement towards democracy in Africa extends to the president himself, Lake said, citing a conversation he had with Clinton following the presentation of credentials by two African ambassadors last month. In response to a question, Lake said he will encourage Clinton to visit Africa while he is in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake emphasized the importance of tackling Africa's problems before they evolve into crises. &quot;Looking back on the elections in Angola, we wish we had acted more aggressively to avoid the problems we face now,&quot; he said.  Internationally supervised balloting in Angola last September resulted in a narrow victory for the government of President Eduardo dos Santos, but the results were disputed by Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel movement Unita, and fierce fighting resumed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war is a continuation of 16 years of conflict on a Cold War battle ground between government forces with Soviet backing and Unita, which received about $300 million in covert U.S. aid. Pressure has been building within the administration and from Congress to recognize dos Santos's government, but Lake said no decision on Angola policy steps has been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake cited several other areas where the administration hopes to chart a new course. He pledged an &quot; activist approach to disasters in the making,&quot; to try to forestall future Somalia-type disasters. The administration is working on ways to resolve conflicts in Sudan and Liberia, he said, and to overcome the &quot;resistance to democratic change&quot; in Zaire and Togo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked by one questioner why the administration has not been &quot;bolder&quot; in pressing Zaire leader Mobutu Sese Seko to agree to the demands of a pro-democracy movement in that country. Lake said Washington has &quot;made clear to Mobutu that we support the democratic process&quot; and is working with Belgium and France on a concerted effort to pressure Mobutu, who seized power in 1965 with CIA support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lake, whose Ph.D. dissertation topic was U.S. policy towards South Africa and who has lived and worked in Africa, is the first national security advisor with direct African experience. &quot;Africa occupies a special place in my work and affections,&quot; he said in his speech. His decision to use the occasion of the luncheon hosted by the Africa Project at Brookings to deliver his maiden address was intended as a strong signal that Africa is an area of interest and concern, White House aides said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Namibian Ambassador Tuliameni Kalomoh said he and other members of the African diplomatic corps in Washington &quot;welcome this assurance of Clinton administration support for the democratic process and for development efforts&quot; in Africa. &quot;We were especially pleased that this was his first speech,&quot; Kalomoh said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NGO policy Statement on Sudan, signed by over sixty U.S.-based organizations and professionals concerned about the need for a stronger international response to the deepening humanitarian and human rights crisis in Sudan. ASSISTING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The diversion, obstruction and interruption of food production, trade and aid deliveries have become integral war strategies for all factions in Sudan. UN and NGO humanitarian efforts, both independent and through Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), have repeatedly been held hostage by these tactics. Although it is important that the donor community continues to press for such steps as unrestricted access for NGOs, safe passage for civilians, and corridors of peace for the supply of relief food, diplomatic efforts to secure access must be fully integrated with broader peace initiatives and human rights pressure. Too often, multiple initiatives are uncoordinated and international efforts and resources are expended on getting limited humanitarian access to certain areas, leaving little energy for building broader conflict resolution processes, such as sustained pressure for and monitoring of cease- fires.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While acknowledging the importance of continued emergency relief supplies, even more critical is the need to help restore subsistence economies, rebuild assets, and re- empower community structures in areas where this is possible. An important component of achieving these goals is to aggressively negotiate demilitarized zones. The concept of negotiated demilitarized zones has been widely confused with militarily-enforced safe havens. Negotiated demilitarized zones are productive areas where people can return to farming and herding. An expanded UN monitoring presence would report violations. One &quot;carrot&quot; which may help to induce agreement is to suggest that the continued provision of certain relief supplies to organizations under the control of warring parties could be conditioned on their agreement to, and respect of, these demilitarized zones. Food would not be discontinued to needy populations; rather, an effort would be made to find alternative conduits for relief supplies. The escalation to militarily-enforced havens is premature, and would serve only to attract or further entrench people away from their home areas in ever- expanding relief camps. Khartoum's recent &quot;charm offensive&quot; provides a window for voluntary agreements to resettle noncombatants in demilitarized zones where the restoration of self-reliance can be made a priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An important aspect of re-empowering community structures is the choice of vehicle for the delivery of relief and rehabilitative assistance.  Local churches are possibly the only accessible, representative institution in SPA- controlled territory of southern Sudan, an area experiencing a significant religious revival. Many individual churches as well as consortia such as the New Sudan Council of Churches have been engaged in relief and rehabilitation activities with their local communities for years, with quite meager resources. The U.S. and UN should examine ways in which assistance can be channeled through the local church networks in order to build local capacity and provide a conduit not directly tied to any warring faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Finally, the London-based organization African Rights and other have continuously pointed out the vital importance which pubic health inputs have in complex humanitarian emergencies such as that which exists in southern Sudan. Epidemics are usually much bigger killers than outright starvation, and Kala Azar and visceral leishmaniasis have taken countless thousands of Sudanese lives. Efforts to combat killer diseases like these need to be vastly augmented. FOSTERING PEACE PROCESSES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is becoming increasingly apparent that the quiet diplomacy approach inherent in the Abuja Process is deeply flawed and not taken seriously by the combatants except as an opportunity to be perceived as seeking peace without being held accountable to any timetable. The U.S. and UN must make the negotiation and monitoring of a comprehensive cease-fire the number one diplomatic priority in Sudan, and put the required energy and resources into building a legitimate peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The process pursued in Somalia provides some lessons for Sudan.  Conflict resolution efforts in Somalia over the last four months followed two parallel tracks. On one track, diplomats brought together warring factions and made the implementation of a cease-fire accord the top priority. On the other, a broad array of unarmed groups participated in local, regional and national discussions aimed at restoring non-military leadership and structures throughout that country. These two tracks were merged in March in an attempt to encourage a more broadly representative settlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A similar process should be modified for Sudan. In negotiations with the government and the SPLA factions, the implementation of a cease-fire accord should be paramount. But a parallel process could be initiated which includes elders, women's groups, teachers, and churches in the south. Local groups could be assisted and encouraged to hold local congresses and meeting in order to express their views both internally and to the international community. Encouragement could also be given to the setting up of independent forums for the expression of opinion by the large number of exiles who are aligned to no specific party in the conflict and are represented by no political group. International church leaders and NGO representatives might be encouraged to visit the south and support local community re-empowerment efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NGOs, religious leaders, and democratic organizations in northern Sudan could be engaged in a similar process. The UN may not be the appropriate convener of such a process, but UN support and recognition for the initiative would be extremely important. DEFENDING HUMAN RIGHTS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International human rights diplomacy, which since 1990 has included aid and trade sanctions and harsh condemnations from bodies such as the UN General Assembly, the U.S. Senate, and the U.K. House of Lords, has potentially succeeded in creating space for more aggressive human rights monitoring. The UN Special Rapporteur provides a promising opening for further concrete actions. A Prerequisite for progress, though, is the necessity for a permanent presence of monitors in areas of persistent violations who would report regularly to the Rapporteur, who in turn report findings regularly to the Security Council. Senate Resolution 94 asks that the UN &quot;place human rights monitors... in areas of Sudan affected by the fighting and human rights abuses,&quot; and we wholeheartedly endorse this recommendation. This would make the broad mandate of the Special Rapporteur -- which includes abuses based on politics, gender, religion, and ethnicity -- much more likely to be met.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is specific urgency to the human rights crisis in the Nuba Mountains, where widespread ethnic cleansing and slave raiding have been reported. If the Rapporteur is denied free access to any areas of southern Kordofan, the U.S. should quickly press the issue in the UN Security Council and with the Sudan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The international community acted far too late in Somalia, after 300,000 people had already perished. The same mistake should not be repeated in Sudan. Replication of these kinds of missions will likely be cost-prohibitive. Limited interventions now will preclude massive intervention later. The international community still has a choice in Sudan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On June 13, 1993 Malawi will hold a national referendum on whether it should retain a single-party system or adopt and multi-party system. The decision to hold the referendum was the result of widespread demonstrations and domestic demands for political reform combined with financial and diplomatic pressure from the international community. For the first time in the 26 years since independence, the people of Malawi will have the opportunity to participate in deciding the nature of their political system.  As important as this is, it is essential that the international community realize that it is only one of the issues at hand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government has imposed severe restrictions on political activity, which limit the freedoms of assembly, association and free expression.  Juxtaposed with this trampling of guarantees essential to civil society was the creation of structure and mechanisms of governmental authority which remain beyond challenge by and accountable to the very people dismantling the system of repression created by President (Hastings Kamuzu) Banda and the Malawi Congress Party is the other critical issue for the June referendum. It is why any effort at identifying a responsible role for the international community must begin well before voting day, and continue well after the results are finalized.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil and political rights affirmed in the International Bill of Human Rights are essential to any voting exercise that aspires to be free and fair(1) Moreover, it is clear that the observance and protection of these rights reflect the general state of human rights in a country and therefore have an importance beyond any single referendum. The choice before the international community is whether it wishes to have a quick vote and get on with business as usual or whether it wishes to help the Malawian people lay the foundation for a society that respects human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The systemic, consistent human rights violations in Malawi are the result of government policies and practices which have continued for so long that they have defined the very nature of Malawian society itself. While changing the personnel involved in setting up such a system may be achieved by voting, changing the norms of 26 years of repressive governmental rule coupled with 26 years of fear and silence by the people of Malawi will not be so easily or quickly achieved. The continuing human rights violation detailed in this report have not been satisfactorily addressed, and will have an impact on both the conduct of the referendum and life after the referendum.  Political reform must be accompanied by rebuilding civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In too many African countries focusing on the week before and the week after a major vote has constituted the extent of efforts to create conditions for democracy. In some cases the seeds of failure sprouted long before monitoring teams even set foot in the countries in question. In others, the brief period of political activity was forgotten as old habits resumed. If democratic rule and respect for human rights are to take hold, then the international community must help the people of Malawi build a rights respecting society, where the right to vote will be one among many rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lawyers Committee calls on both the Government of Malawi and the international community to act to ensure an environment that respects the rights to freedom of speech, assembly, association and the right to due process prior to the upcoming referendum and to monitor closely the government's observance of these rights afterwards. To reiterate the thinking of the second &quot;UN Technical Report,&quot; the Malawian government must appreciate that the process and procedures involved in staging a free and fair vote is what is critical to the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lawyers Committee endorses the reports of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">UN Electoral Assistance Unit: &quot;UN Technical Team on the Conduct off a Free and Fair Referendum on the Issue of a One-Party/Multiparty System in Malawi,&quot; and &quot;Further Report on the Conduct off a Free and Fair Referendum on the Issue of a One-Party/Multiparty System in Malawi,&quot; and ardently reaffirms these reports' recommendations(2), in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">particular:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Creating an impartial referendum authority</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Guaranteeing freedom of association, assembly, expression and movement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Creating an adequate atmosphere for a free, fair and peaceful campaign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Ensuring the full participation of international observers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Lawyers Committee urges the international community to play an active role in assisting the people of Malawi in implementing the recommendations of the UN Technical Team and to bring the force of international opinion to bear on the government of Malawi for any actions which divert the country from a free and fair vote. It is essential that international monitoring and involvement begin well before June 13, and continue for some time afterwards.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We also wish to reiterate the importance of continued international pressure in regard to the unfinished business of curbing human rights abuses in Malawi. The constitutionally &quot;legal&quot; structures and official procedures which the government uses to suppress freedom of expression, detain opponents without trial, and deny due process will still be in place the day after the referendum. As long as the remain in force the observance of human rights in Malawi will remain at best, precarious. Moreover, any potential transition to a multiparty system will quickly find itself crippled without sweeping legal reforms. The campaign to promote the respect of human rights must continue to be a priority before, during and after the referendum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The upcoming referendum represents a pivotal moment for the Malawian people in their quest for basic human rights and a rare opportunity for donor governments like the United States to assist them. It would be a tragedy for all involved were the emphasis to be placed on holding a simple vote rather than promoting fundamental reforms to build a lasting environment that ensures respect for human rights, for all the rights essential for a fair vote and for the results of that vote to be respected and carried out. -30- (1) Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that &quot;everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers.&quot; Art. 20 states that everyone has the right to peaceful assembly.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a major about-turn, government this week requested that the ANC train its Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) soldiers inside the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This emerged during negotiations between government and ANC officials on the establishment of the National Peacekeeping Force (NPKF) to deal with political violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While the ANC has agreed in principle to the training of MK cadres inside the country, such a move would be in direct contravention of the Groote Schuur Minute signed by the ANC and the National Party in 1990.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both parties, however, have agreed to work at eliminating the restrictions contained in the Groote Schuur agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Delegations representing MK and the SA Defense Force (SADF) met at the Simon's Town Naval base recently to exchange views on how such a structure should function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEW NATION has reliably learnt that the government was positive about the move, but was a &quot;bit&quot; concerned that the NPKF would marginalize the SA Police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In terms of the ANC's blueprint, the NPKF will consist of elements drawn from all parties taking part in negotiations. This means that the SADF, SAP, homeland armies and police forces, MK and Apla would second personnel to the peace force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> COMMANDER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The training and command of the NPKF would be carried out by international experts in peacekeeping operations. The United Nations would provide the commander of the NPKF in consultation with the Transitional Executive Council (TEC).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NPKF will be accountable to the TEC and will also include personalities from the National Peace Accord and other organs of civil society.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the establishment of the NPKF and SAP and the SADF will be confined to activities relating to the maintenance of law and order and the defense of the borders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NPKF will exist until a government of national unity is established.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Progress on the establishment of a joint peace- keeping force coincides with the emergence of a new military threat from the right with the coalescence of conservative forces under the leadership of former SADF and police generals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The generals are confident of widespread support in the army and are certain that secessionist moves to establish a volkstaat will not be opposed by the SADF.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Spokesperson for the right wing Volksfront formed by the generals, Riaan van Rensburg, told NEW NATION that he did not believe the government has the necessary control over the army to order it to block a breakaway from South Africa by white conservatives.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An untested substance being described as &quot;fertilizer&quot; made from household waste is being imported into The Gambia from Europe, in contravention of the Environmental Protection Act and without knowledge of the Environment Ministry, the Daily Observer has discovered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our farm correspondent was alerted to the unapproved product, known as A4 Compost, by concerned farmers. He discovered that the substance is being imported and distribute in 50 litre bags by Africa Organic Limited, a company based in Latrikunda Sabiji. Twenty-five 20-foot containers of the substance have so far entered The Gambia. The bags, which bear no label to determine the product's composition, are selling for D35 each. Our reporter contacted Will Lottin, the Dutch manager of Africa Organic, to find out more about the alleged fertilizer. Mr. Lottin showed him a phytosanitary service certification from the Plant Protection Service in Holland, which declares the product free from germs and seeds. The certificate, however, bears no countersignatory from the relevant Gambian authorities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our reporter saw another document -- a note written by Sano Ceesay of the Food and Africulture Organization (FAO) of the UN which said the fertilizer should undergo proper testing. Mr. Lottin has confirmed that this has not been done. But he said his fertilizer is being distributed in many parts of the country. When asked by the reporter how farmers reacted to the substance, Mr. Lottin said some farmers found it useful and some did not like it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Malang Barrow, a senior environment officer at the Ministry of Water Resources and the Environment, has expressed grave concern at the presence of this unscreened product in The Gambia. He explained that the importation of any kind of waste into the country is against the law and constitutes &quot;dumping,&quot; according to the Environmental Protection (Prevention of Dumping) Act of 1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Act interprets waste as &quot;any form of industrial waste product or matter, whether known to be hazardous to human health or the natural environment or not.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My office has just rejected the application of a company which was about to import waste into The Gambia to generate energy,&quot; said Mr. Barrow.  &quot;If a company wants to promote organic fertilizer they should use out local household waste. It is under the pretext of selling fertilizers that developed countries manage to dump their unwanted waste on developing countries,&quot; he pointed out.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He regretted that the Ports Authority and the Bureau of Customs allowed the A4 Compost into the country without the knowledge of his Ministry. Mr. Barrow declared that his office will do all in its power to bring an end to the illegal importation. &quot;The Environmental Protection Act gives my office the mandate to do this,&quot; he declared.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Indeed, the Act proclaims that anyone found guilty of dumping in the country any waste produced from sources outside The Gambia &quot;is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding five hundred thousand dalasis or a term of imprisonment not exceeding five years or to both such fine and imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Act continues that &quot;if the court finds that the waste dumped...contains any radioactive, toxic, or other substance hazardous to humans or the natural environment,&quot; it can impose a maximum fine of 50 million dalasis or a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The DAILY OBSERVER has learned that there is no suitable equipment in The Gambia to carry out the necessary tests, such as checking for the presence of nuclear wastes or for harmful heavy materials such as lead. The controversial fertilizer will therefore need to undergo thorough tests at a laboratory outside The Gambia to determine its exact contents. -30</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank's top policymaker for Africa yesterday announced sweeping changes in the institution's approach to the continent's economic problems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a speech to the annual conference of the African- American Institute, Edward V. K. Jaycox, vice president for the Africa Region, said the Bank no longer will dictate development plans to African countries and will stop &quot;imposing&quot; foreign expertise on reluctant African governments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calling the current pattern of technical assistance to Africa &quot;a systematic, destructive force,&quot; he said future programs will be aimed at building Africa's capacity to help itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This is a big change -- brand new,&quot; Jaycox said.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the world's poorest countries are in Africa, the only region whose poverty has deepened in recent years. But the continent also has vast untapped wealth and already is a larger trading market for the United States than the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speech was an off-the-record address to a closed plenary of the Institute's conference, but Jaycox agreed afterwards to release his remarks for publication.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The policy shift, if implemented, will have repercussions throughout Africa, because the Bank is the key economic player in a continent Jaycox described as having been in &quot;economic free fall.&quot; For the last decade, the Bank has shaped the development agenda in Africa, formulating policies that have guided the practices of its sister institution, the international Monetary Fund, as well as the aid programs of the United States and other donor countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Acknowledging that the Bank has been unable to devise effective solutions to Africa's persistent economic problems, Jaycox said that in the future the Bank will help fund African governments to write their own development plans and will use the bulk of a $20 million economic research fund to support studies commissioned by Africans themselves, rather than to pay for studies by Bank economists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, development projects funded by the Bank &quot;are now forbidden to have resident foreign management teams,&quot; and must recruit skilled Africans instead, Jaycox said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Four billion dollars a year goes into the salaries of expatriate advisors,&quot; he said, and has undercut African expertise. Critics of current development programs have estimated that over 100,000 foreign experts working in sub- Saharan Africa consume a major chunk of all foreign aid moneys to the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In another action to support the goal of building Africa's own capabilities, Jaycox announced that universities in the United States and other western nations that have World Bank-funded contracts to train African economic managers must move their programs to Africa within three years and must collaborate with African universities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The statement startled conference participants. &quot;It's so dramatic a change that I wonder if I heard him correctly,&quot; said Dr. Robert S. Browne of Howard university, a former senior advisor on international economic policy to the Carter administration and Congressional committees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Adebayo Adedeji, Executive Director of the African Center for Development and Strategic Studies in Nigeria, agreed that the speech represented a reversal of direction for the financial institution but stopped short of applauding the change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;He admits failure, admits mistakes, admits that the Bank has been misled and has misled the countries it has been advising,&quot; he said. &quot;But how many thousands of African children have died while those mistakes were being made?&quot; Adedeji says the World Bank &quot;must go beyond admitting mistakes and discard its faulty programs.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several conference participants said they were concerned that Jaycox continued to defend the controversial policy of structural adjustment, an economic austerity program that critics say embodies necessary reforms but puts too much emphasis on economic growth statistics and too little on improvements in education, health and public welfare. &quot;There were no alternatives (to structural adjustment) and there still aren't,&quot; Jaycox said in a question session after the speech.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Robert Berg, president of the Washington, DC- based International Development Conference, said that the speech nevertheless represents a &quot;sea change in World Bank thinking that will put Africa's own leadership at the center of the development process for the first time.&quot; Berg said that in an era of sweeping democracy in Africa, where more than a dozen countries have replaced authoritarian regimes with elected governments, it is appropriate that &quot;Africa is finally having an influence on the policies of the World Bank.&quot; -30EUROPEAN WASTE SOLD AS FERTILIZER HERE</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> KAMPALA, June 10, 1993 -- The governing body of the World Food Progamme today approved an 18-month extension of a project supplying relief food to 92,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda, and stated that this number could rise to 115,000 during the course of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP -- the food aid organization of the United Nations -- will provide a total of 31,000 tonnes of food commodities for the period July 1993 to December 1994, as well as a cash subsidy of US$ 90 a ton for internal transport, storage and handling of these commodities. The total cost to WFP of this latest project will be nearly US$ 10 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since September 1988, there has been a steady flow of refugees from southern Sudan into Uganda. The rate of influx reached a peak in 1989 when it was estimated that some 50,000 Sudanese had crossed the border. Due to the persistent insecurity in south Sudan, refugees continued to arrive throughout 1990, 1991, and 1992. The arrival rate during the second half of 1992 averaged 1000 a month. By January 1993, a joint WFP/UNHCR and government mission confirmed the total number of refugees at 92,000, of whom 84,000 are in Adjumani (East Moyo) and 8,000 in Kiryandongo (Masindi district).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP has been providing food assistance to the refugees since May 1989, initially under an emergency operation, and then through three protracted refugee operations. In February 1993, the government of Uganda, observing the need to continue assisting the refugees and the likelihood that their numbers would increase, requested WFP to provide further aid for a projected number of 115,000 Sudanese refugees from July 1993 for 18 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years, the government has maintained a policy of allowing entry to the refugees and, to the extent possible, of providing them with agricultural land. This is to enable the refugees to achieve a measure of self- sufficiency, pending their eventual voluntary repatriation to Sudan.  There are no restrictions on refugees taking up employment or engaging in commercial trade alongside the indigenous population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of the 84,000 refugees in Adjumani, some 31,000 have been given land (over two hectares per family) and are settled in 12 villages in the area, while approximately 53,000 continue to live in two large camps at Ogujebe.  The 31,000 settled refugees harvested some crops during 1992, especially cereals. They are also able to fish in the nearby Albert Nile and have some limited opportunities for agricultural employment. These activities have given them a degree of self-sufficiency, thus enabling a progressive reduction in the daily ration provided by WFP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees in the camps, on the other hand, are still entirely dependent on food aid. While efforts are continuing to find land for these refugees, this has been difficult, due to scarcity of available land and lack of government funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Kiryandongo, about 2,350 hectares of land have been allocated for the settling on 951 families, who are presently constructing shelters and clearing the land for agriculture. They are being provided with seeds and agricultural tools and are expected to harvest some crops by August/September 1993. The Ranches Restructuring Board, through the Ministry of Local Government, is trying to identify more land to be used for resettling the remaining 1,410 families.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP has so far committed 52,000 tonnes of commodities to the refugee operation in Uganda, at a cost of US$ 10 million. The Programme also wants to expand the potential for expanding development activities among the refugee population, such as road clearing and maintenance, installation of culverts, construction of communal facilities such as schools and health centres and afforestation. -30phone: (256-41) 244010.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Gori Ogbara, co-ordinator of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, in Shomolu Local Government Area and a businessman is, as a Lagos resident, used to unusual situations. But the incident of the early evening of Thursday May 6 overwhelmed him. All through that day, he had searched for diesel fuel for his generator, to keep his dry cleaning outfit running. For days, his shop, located in the Fayedi area of Lagos mainland had been without regular electricity supply. Customers were harassing his staff. One of them told Ogbara he could buy at a petrol station at Akwonjo, along the Lagos Abeokuta expressway.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ogbara headed for the place in his Mercedes Benz 200 saloon. Just after the Ikeja bus stop along the expressway, he ran into a horde of stranded commuters, who had taken over the road. Claiming to be on &quot;Operation Solidarity for the Suffering Masses,&quot; they stopped and interrogated. He was forced to give &quot;lift&quot; to six people who were going to Alagbado, half way between Lagos and Ota in Ogun State. He</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">told NEWSWATCH: &quot;The situation was tense. I could not believe such a thing could happen. Worse, I ended up not getting diesel.&quot; His business throughout that day remained at a standstill.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For several weeks now, commuters and private car owners in Lagos were faced with the problem of fuel scarcity. The shortage which started with diesel oil and saw long haul commercial buses off the roads has since spread to include petrol and even kerosene. At the Bay Petrol station on Isheri road in the Ogudu area of Lagos, the last consignment of fuel was delivered on May 11. It ran out two days later on May 13.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, the crisis worsened when workers of the Total Nigeria, Plc went on strike. All outlets of the oil company shut down operations since May 17. The strike no doubt, increased pressure on other filling stations. But Lagos is not alone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Akwa Iborn State, economic activities virtually came to a halt for lack of fuel at the filling stations. But the blackmarkets at the Ikot Ekpene road and the Barrack road in Uyo are doing good business. There, illegal outlets sell a litre of petrol for as much for as much as N15.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story is the same in Calabar and Port Harcourt, where long queues of motorists keep vigil in petrol stations, waiting to buy fuel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But if scarcity is an occasional thing in southern parts of the country, it has become a permanent feature in the north. In the federal capital, Abuja, signboards proclaiming &quot;No fuel&quot; are regular sights in the six fillings stations. Fuel scarcity was first noticed in Abuja just before the summit of the Organization of African Unity, OAU, in 1991. Since then the shortage of petrol has completely disappeared. Ironically, the fuel shortage in the city is no respecter of persons. NEWSWATCH learnt that officials of the presidency have sometimes had to alter the schedule of the president due to petrol scarcity. Although the presidency receives bulk allocation of fuel from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, the supplies have not been regular. This nearly affected the visit of Maryam Babangida, the First Lady, to Kwara State April 24. The advance party of vehicles that was to leave Abuja to Kwara by road nearly did not make it. The drivers had to sleep overnight from Thursday April 22 till Friday April 23 at the Agip filling station in the Wuse area. The vehicles did not leave the filling station until about 2 p.m. that day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The persistent scarcity of fuel in the northern parts of the country is affecting the campaign schedule of Bashir Tofa, the National Republican Convention, NRC, presidential flag bearer and Moshood Abiola, his counterpart in SDP. NEWSWATCH gather last week that the &quot;Hope '93&quot; campaign train of Abiola which was in Kaduna, Katsina and Kebbi was halted by fuel scarcity.  The politicians bought jerricans of 18 litres for N200. It used to cost N18.  Indeed, in Yola and Jos, a tin of petrol costs as much as N1,000.00 A litre is now N100.00 The National Electoral Commission, NEC, has appealed to NNPC to make contingency plans to supply it with fuel for the June 12 election.  The worsening situation of fuel is also crippling industries. For instance, on Wednesday May 12, the &quot;Champion&quot; newspaper, was not published because the company had no electricity and could not run its generating plant because there was no diesel oil. According to Henry Odukomaiya, editor-in-chief and managing director of the &quot;Champion&quot; newspaper group, the company had gone as far as Ibadan and Ijebu-Ode in search of diesel. No luck. He told NEWSWATCH that as a result of non- production the newspaper lost about N500,000.00 in sales and advertisements.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story is no different in other companies operating in Lagos. Most industries are producing at less than 40 percent of their capacity due to lack of diesel to run generating plants. Odukomaiya lamented the situation.  &quot;Nigeria is in a fix; everything in Nigeria is not working. All the facilities have broken down. We do not know whether we are going forward or backward. I think the government has to do something about this.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Lagos, two weeks ago the vice president, Augustus Aikhomu, explained that the scarcity of fuel was due to mechanical faults in the Kaduna refinery which produces 100,000 barrels per day. He said spares to rectify the fault would soon be purchased. Curiously, the NNPC had last month declared the refinery operational and had indeed invited Philip Asiodu, the secretary for petroleum resources, to commission the newly repaired refinery.  On the very day the secretary appeared accompanied by media men, fire broke out in the area 2 of the refinery. The commissioning was postponed.  Indications are that the turnaround maintenance of the refinery, that has been going on since 1991 may take a long time to be completed. Last week, Uche Chukwumerije, secretary for information and culture announced what he described as a three-pronged strategy to battle fuel shortage. He said a joint meeting of the transitional council and the National Defence and Security Council would take a comprehensive action on the border smuggling; the enforcement of high level of probity and self discipline among all the actors involved in the distribution network of petroleum and the temporary conversion of oil pipelines feeding crude oil to the Kaduna refinery. He added that the two refineries in Port Harcourt and Warri were producing at full capacity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, the impact of these two refineries is not felt. Port Harcourt produces 120,000 barrels per day, while Warri produces 35,000 per day. The senate committee on petroleum and mineral resources last week described the scarcity of fuel in the country as &quot;a national embarrassment.&quot; Lawan Gana Guba, chairman of the committee, said that as from this week, the senate would begin a public hearing into the reasons for the shortage that has &quot;closed down our social and national activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, Asiodu inaugurated a committee to search for solutions to the persistent problem. Comprising of Hassan Hadeja, secretary of state for the petroleum ministry, Edmond Dakoru, managing director of the NNPC, Sannia Bello, NNPC's group executive director for refineries and petrochemicals and the members of the board of the Kaduna refinery, Asiodu's committee is the second to be set up within the past week. Earlier, a committee had been set up by the 16 northern governors to unravel the mystery behind the shortage of petroleum. Even so, by the end of last week, there was little hope that the committees could find a solution for the fuel shortage. Long queues continued to feature at petrol stations around the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Calebs Olumense, proprietor of Nite Shift, a nightclub in Ikeja, Lagos, tried last week to courageously hide his pain at his loss. His residence at 31, Allen Avenue was razed May 18. Not much of his property was saved. He told NEWSWATCH what happened; &quot;you know, as usual, there was no light on Allen and that night (May 17) I switched on the generator, like I usually do, to allow it to rest and conserve diesel. NEPA had not brought back light then, but when they did a few minutes later, to my dismay I heard a large explosion. I suspect that NEPA fed high voltage into the house and caused the explosion. Before we could not do much to prevent the house from being razed. I will not blame anybody for the fire, it was an act of God.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The case of Olumense is definitely the height of agony Nigerians have been going through under the &quot;no light&quot; regime of the National Electric Power (NEP), Plc. In many parts of the country, prolonged darkness is the norm.  Last month, Saleh Michika, governor of Adamawa State felt so frustrated that he gave NEP an ultimatum to restore power to Yola, the state capital or face his wrath. Michika had toured NEP facilities in the state and could not understand why there was no light since nothing was apparently wrong with NEP equipment. NEP apologized to Michika in a statement signed by W.A. Agbede, the general manager, transmission, for the Bauchi region. According to Agbede, the prolonged outage in the state was due to a fault in NEP equipment at the Gombe transmission sub-station which feeds Yola. He assured that the company was working round the clock to restore power supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Ikeja area of Lagos, residents enjoy electricity for only about three hours in a day. Even some who stay in priority areas are not so lucky.  For instance, at Isaac John Street, in the Ikeja GRA there are two priority lines. One goes to the Lagos state governor's residence on the street and the other goes to the Ikeja General Hospital. But both priority lines have no regular power supply either. Last week, residents of Ijora, in Lagos sent an SOS to NEP, requesting it to restore power to the thriving commercial area.  Spokesman for the residents, Adesola Adebayo, a medical doctor who runs a private clinic, said that businesses in the area have suffered severe losses for lack of power supply.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sometime last month, NEP announced that seven states would experience extended periods of blackout as it was carrying out repairs on its 330KV line along the Benin/Onitsha transmission line. The states were Delta, Edo, Anambra, Enugu, Benue, Cross Rivers, Kogi and Taraba. NEP has completed the repair work but the states still experience prolonged periods of blackout.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worsening power cuts are said by NEP officials to be caused by the explosion at the Egbin thermal station which has a capacity of 3200 megawatts and supplies 50 percent of the country's power needs. The explosion, which occurred last December and put three of the six generating units of the thermal station out of service, was said to have been caused by the feeding of condensate, instead of dry gas, to the turbines by the Nigerian Gas Company. NGC, has since denied this. Adesola Macaulay, as assistant general manager said the federal government has been able to secure a $60 million (about N1.2 billion) loan from Exim Bank of Japan to overhaul the thermal station. The problems at Egbin, he explained necessitated the rationing of power in most parts of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kainji, Afam and Sapele stations are in dire need of rehabilitation too. NEP officials told NEWSWATCH there are no spares in the stores at NEP headquarters in Lagos to overhaul those stations. The spares include transformers, cables, jointing equipment and equipment to support network</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">improvement. Said a NEP official: &quot;The money is not just there to procure equipment.&quot; The official said that for the power company to be really efficient, it would need nothing less than five billion naira to improve its services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That amount is by no means an exaggeration. According to officials, most transformers in the country are overloaded and the company is finding it difficult to buy new ones. Two years ago, a transformer costs N50,000. Now, the price is about N400,000. Red tape is also is a stumbling block to efficient performance of NEP, despite the fact that the company has been commercialised. Last year, the NEP board approved the creation of 8 zones, each to be headed by a general manager. Each zone is to be responsible for distribution and sale of electricity after receiving power in bulk from the national grid. The idea behind the creation of zones is to decentralize NEP along lines of a profit- oriented company. But the N1 million each zonal general manager needs as take-off grant has not been given to them. Also, the former executive director in charge of distribution who was retired about two weeks ago was said to be the only person who gives out equipment to the zones. The</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">situation is yet to change. Said a NEP staff: &quot;You will discover that if GM in charge of the Maiduguri zone wants equipment or needs N20,000, he will have to come to Lagos and that trip alone, in terms of transport and accommodation will cost N10,000.&quot; Officials painted a bleak future for the NEP and the country. The system is collapsing and as a result, the country will continue to experience blackouts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Said a NEP district officer: &quot;There in nothing we can do about this and don't forget that it's also affecting our morale.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Augustine Ahiazu, a professor and vice-chancellor of the Rivers State University of Science and Technology, sits in his office trying to make sense out of what is happening to tertiary education in the country. It is just a couple of days into yet another strike by the Academic Staff of Nigeria Universities, ASNU and academic activities in his university are paralysed.  In September, the teachers were promised better conditions of service and university autonomy by the government. They called off their strike. They went back on strike three weeks ago. These have been protracted strikes that have paralysed education. No one</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">knows when sessions will begin and end. Said Ahiazu: &quot;Many universities are just running crash programmes; students come in, study for one week and again they are away. I must tell you that our universities are no longer ivory towers. Reason has been thrown overboard. The system lacks steady flow in planning and programme. We can't be sure again of the kind of degree and manpower we turn out. This is a sad development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There seems to be no amicable settlement in sight between university lecturers and the government, a sure sign that for another extended period, education in higher institutions will be a standstill. Last week, students began to move out of university campuses as they became uncertain of when the universities would resume. ASNU had gone on strike, May 3 following the expiration of the ultimatum given to the government to reverse its decision of parity in remuneration between teachers and non-teaching staff of universities. The teachers had accused government and specifically Ben Nwabueze, a professor and secretary of education, of breaching the agreement reached with them last September. Matter got worse when Nwabueze insisted that the agreement was not binding on government and threatened that if the teachers went on strike they should consider themselves dismissed. Last week, lecturers of Nigeria's premier university, the University of Ibadan headed to an Ibadan high court seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining the university authorities from ejecting them from their official quarters.  Justice Pius Aderemi granted the injunction. The leader of the banned Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, Atahiru Jega had also gone to Lagos high court to challenge the right of government to sack academics. He prayed that the court declare such action null and void and illegal. Jega also wants the court to declare the essential services decree signed May 4 by the president which makes it illegal for teaching staff to go on industrial action; retroactive, selective, unjust, illegal and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ASNU issued an eight-point guideline to its members as a pre-emptive measure against harassment by government. Part of it advised lecturers not to sign any register or reapply as government &quot;would soon see the folly of its ways.&quot; It further stated that &quot;even if you are deemed to have resigned your jobs, you have the legal right to your official residence until you have found alternative accommodation.&quot; The guidelines ended by urging ASNU members not to &quot;panic as government is waging a psychological war. Government cannot replace us if we act uniformly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the strike enters its fourth week, it would appear that the issue of parity of pay with non-teaching staff is taking the back burner. Lecturers are insisting that the government should unban ASUU, fund universities and respect university autonomy. NEWSWATCH found that in many higher institutions, education has become almost impossible due to the lack of materials to write with. At the Niger road in the University of Ibadan, where many of its science laboratories are located, water has not run for the past 15 years, making laboratory work impossible. In some faculties, such as theater arts, teachers have no chalk. Said a</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">lecturer: &quot;Students are so demoralised that they just scribble anything and hand it over to you.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worsening system of Nigerian university education is made the more evident by new rules which now guide post- graduate admission to universities in Britain. Before a graduate of a Nigerian university is admitted for a post graduate course he must pass a written examination. Universities in America are also said to be seriously thinking of adopting the same method.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics, ASUP, ignored the essential services decree and went on strike action last week. The polytechnic teachers claimed that the nation's education was grossly underfunded and neglected by the government. They also described the decree as retrogressive and a gross violation of human rights as enshrined in the constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Academics and some concerned elder citizens were scheduled to meet in Ibadan last Saturday. A similar meeting between leaders of ASNU and the senate did not hold the previous week because ASNU members did not show up in Abuja. But Jega said ASNU received no invitation from the senate requesting it appear before it. Decisions reached at the Ibadan talks, hosted by Olumbe Bassir, a professor and former president of the National Association of University Teachers, a fore-runner of ASUU, will be passed on to government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even as peace moves are being made, ASNU has given indication that it will not back down on its demands. Jega said last week that the association remained committed to defending the university system by continuing the strike until &quot;our demands are met.&quot; He added, however, that ASNU would continue to participate in peace discussions aimed at &quot;a speedy resolution of the present crisis.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joseph Nwaijie, secretary-general of the Nigerian Union of Railmen went home after work Friday, May 14, looking forward to a quiet weekend with his family. It was not meant to be. Soon after he got home about 300 railmen forced their way into his house, beat him up, harassed his family and even attacked his daughter with a knife. They then went ahead to vandalise his property before trooping out on the streets protesting their non-payment of salaries. On a television programme last week Nwaijie supported the action of the railmen who beat him up. &quot;You know, a hungry man is an angry man.&quot; he said, explaining that the railway men who had been on strike for the past 26 days had the right to be angry because they have not been paid since July, last year. According to him, the federal government last December announced that it had released N1.7 billion to the Nigerian Railway Corporation, NRC, and the priority was that as long as the workers' salaries remain unsettled, rail transport and services in the country would remain at a standstill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rail services have been paralysed since the beginning of this year.  Workers of the NRC have gone on strike about six times this year, protesting their deplorable conditions of service. Last week, Nwafor Maduekue, managing director of the NRC, explained that the 1991 minimum wage policy pushed up salaries in the corporation for N11 million to N16 million. Also, the 45 percent increment across the board, approved by the federal government for civil servants last year, increased the wage bills further to N29 million.  Maduekwe said he did not know how the NRC, with only 30 engines, aging tracks and rickety coaches could afford such wage bills.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over the years, the issue of urban road transportation has become an intractable problem. In 1988, the federal government initiated the Federal Urban Mass Transit Programme (FUMTP), with a budget of N700 million. Over the last four years, the FUMTP has received over N2 billion from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But sadly, all the money seems not to have made an impact on urban transportation. In Lagos, for instance, the veritable yardstick for the programme's success, about 6.4 million people commute per day in the metropolis. A breakdown shows that the private buses, generally referred to as &quot;molue&quot; carry about 2,080,000 passengers daily, minibuses also known as &quot;Danfo&quot; handle about 1,980,000 people per day, taxis take care of 120,000 passengers, while the state government owned Lagos State Transport Corporation can only carry about 150,000 persons per day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the FUMTP, LSTC was allocated 188 buses. The corporation has about 603 buses but fewer that 100 are in operation. By the end of the year, the corporation owed N10 million. Michael Olawale Cole, Lagos state commissioner for works and transport, told NEWSWATCH that government realises less than 30 percent return on investment on the LSTC. He said the corporation was bogged down by mismanagement, fraud and theft, and an acute lack of responsibility on the part of management and workers. Cole said that the corporation is currently undergoing a &quot;surgical operation to determine which is should survive or be allowed to die naturally.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The story is the same with all the state owned transport companies.  The Ondo State-owned mass transit company, is in the habit of losing money.  In 1991, it declared a loss of N2 million. Of the about 89 vehicles in its fleet, only a quarter are serviceable. The Bauchi State- owned Yankari Mass transit company's fleet of 42 vehicles, only 19 are road worthy. Last year, Auwala Gwadabe, its chairman, described employees of the company as &quot;cheats and people of dubious character.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A 1990 survey of state owned transport companies showed that all of them operate at a loss because of mismanagement. Oyo State trancity transport lost N2.7 million; Benue transport, N6 million and Borno State transport N6.5 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Transporters, cashing in on the fuel scarcity have increased fares, sometimes by 250 percent. In Lagos, for instance, a ride from Ojuelegba to CMS which usually cost N4 was N10 last week. Molue buses charged N5 from Ojota to Idumota. It was normally N3. On Wednesday May 8, business activities in Enugu came to a standstill when bus drivers withdrew their services in protest against attacks from traders. The traders had demonstrated against fare hikes. They destroyed windscreens and damaged vehicles in the attempt to compel drivers to revert to the normal fare of two naira per drop, the bus operators refused.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Isaac Ukpong (not real name) a reporter with an Isolo- based newspaper house has developed a rather interesting banking habit. Every month, as his salary is paid into the Union Bank, Isolo branch, Ukpong withdraws every kobo from</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">his current account. He explains why: &quot;Most times you go to the bank and discover that they are on strike, no warning, no nothing. You are left in a lurch with no money to spend.&quot; Now he feels it's better to withdraw all his salary at once and keep it in the house where a sudden strike action would not affect him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Never has disruption in banking services in the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">country been as frequent as in recent times: on Tuesday, April 11, a day after Easter celebration, many people went to their banks to withdraw money but found the gates shut. Junior workers of most of the old banks chose the day to go on a week-long strike to press home demands for a 57% across the board salary increase. Only a few banks rendered skeletal services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strike was called off after the management met their demand. The strike was spear-headed by the National Union of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions Employees, NUBIFIE.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dayo Awobajo, senior secretary-general of NUBIFIE told NEWSWATCH that the industrial action was caused by a misunderstanding between the employers and the union over the review of an expired collective agreement. He said the disagreement had now been resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But before the dust raised by the salary increment increase settled down, another round of industrial crises erupted. This time it was organised by the senior staff of banks. Their grouse bothers on the on-going face off between Owena Bank management and the staff. The management had sacked over 300 of its 700 staff force. The striking senior staff insisted that the management must reinstate the sacked workers. The junior staff who were not involved in the strike claimed there was no way the could work without the co-operation of the senior staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the strike has been suspended (it lasted for one week May 10-17) following the intervention of the ministry of finance, the problem is not over. If the ministry fails to resolve it, they may resume the strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> No one knows where to turn any more. --Reported by Sam Olukoya, Olu Ojewale, Jonah Achema, Kayode Olaokun and Eme Bassey.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I was thinking it would be a success, but now I'm in a pool of confusion,&quot; says the recently returned 20-year-old Standard pupil Vivian Nahara.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although she feels alone in her troubles, her feelings of disappointment and pain are shared by several other women who have returned from years in exile to find a South Africa far less rosy than they dreamt of.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a series of interviews conducted in Durban, NEW NATION found several women battling to survive since their return to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Many are women from southern African countries who had married South African exiles and returned with them. Others were simply South Africans who now have difficulty in finding employment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The women explained how they faced a host of cultural problems in adopting the South African lifestyle. In some cases, the new environment had added tensions to their marriages.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For 35-year-old MK soldier Amanda Masuku (not her real name), who spent 11 years in exile in Angola and Tanzania, her return home has meant having to cope with a new struggle -- to make ends meet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said that the difficulties she faced during her six years of training in Angola were not as severe as the depression she now faces. &quot;There were times when I said to myself, I'm going to do it, because I'm here to learn and fight for my people,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After completing military training, Masuku was trained as a dentistry assistant and worked at the Holland Solidarity Hospital in Tanzania. Yet she is unable to find recognition for her qualifications and secure a proper job as a health care worker in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A former political activist, Masuku no longer attends ANC meetings in her home township, Chesterville. She said that her unemployment has made her lose self-confidence, so that she does not feel good about participating in meetings. &quot;I want to work first. Then I can do other organisational activities.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zambian-born Ruth Mwanza has also stayed away from the ANC since arriving in South Africa with her South African husband, whom she met in exile. Formerly with the ANC women's section tailoring department in Lusaka, Mwanza said she is afraid of the politics here. &quot;I always hear of people being killed,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mwanza, who lives with her husband's family in Mpumalanga, near Hammarsdale. Her biggest problem has been to conform to the traditional role of 'makoti' (bride) in an extended family. After three months, her husband's family said they did not accept her because the couple had not been married according to Zulu custom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Zambia, no labola is paid,&quot; explained Mwanza.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said she felt constrained by the &quot;passive&quot; role that she, as the wife of the home, was supposed to play. &quot;In Zambia, women are free. As long as we have done the housework, we can go anywhere.&quot; she said. &quot;Even the gogo can drink beer, but I as the makoti, I must just sit quietly.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nahara, who studied at the Solomon Mahlangu Freedom College in Tanzania before returning to South Africa a year ago, also said that she found the sexist &quot;social rules&quot; of South African society difficult to adjust to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the college, women were treated equal as men, she said. &quot;But here I can see that men do most things, we even sit separately at school... It seems we are still backward.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said she often feels ashamed because she can't speak fluent Zulu, having learned Swahili, Portuguese, Xhosa and Sotho while in exile. &quot;If you can't speak proper Zulu, people treat you like you're not a real South African,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the other hand, 73-year-old Janice Dlamini, who spent the last 20 years in Tanzania, can still speak fluent Zulu. But this seems of little use to her. &quot;I survived by selling fruit and vegetables in Tanzania. Then the government bought us a plane ticket to return to South Africa, so that I could see my home,&quot; said Dlamini.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She said she returned early this year and has no home, no food, and no way of sending her six children to school. She is staying at a friend's home in Chesterville, along with several other recently returned women who share the same plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Chesterville Youth Development Programme (CYDP) worker Sipho Nxumalo said that the CYDP is helping many returned exiles throughout Chesterville with food vouchers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing one of the cases, he said there was a tough situation involving a Tanzanian woman who had married a South African in exile and returned with him and their three children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;She no longer has good communication with her husband. He has started drinking, used up all the subsidy grants, and told her that she should go back,&quot; said Nxumalo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) director for Natal, Prova Borges, said that foreign spouses encountered many problems upon returning to South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The relationship comes under strain with the new dynamics of the man's family. Things get tense when he can't find a job. And many of them have gone back to their old girlfriends and abandoned the women they married in exile,&quot; said Borges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For all returning exiles, the unemployment, violence and sometimes hostile attitudes of other South Africans struggling to make ends meet, has left many disillusioned. Some even wish to return to exile, if they could find the means.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The temporary closure of the National Co-ordinating Committee on Repatriation (NCCR) following corruption scandals last year has left many returnees with nowhere to turn to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, according to Borges, the UNHCR has committed itself to fund returnee programmes until the end of 1993. Once the NCCR re-opens, hopefully before the end of May, funds will once again be channeled to those in need through the NCCR, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fundamentals were most at work recently in Nigeria, where the annulment of elections by General Babangida brought Nigeria into a storm of protest from the U.S., which threatened to cut off vital financial assistance to the country. Nigeria par bonds fell about 200 bp as did the Promissory Notes. Despite the very high stripped yields on the Nigeria Brady Bonds, we urge caution at this time.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The civil war in Mozambique has left hundreds of thousands dead and caused five million Mozambicans to flee their homes, about one-third of whom found refuge in neighboring countries. This carnage and devastation was inflicted on a nation that was already desperately poor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Most observers doubted that a peace agreement could be reached with the unpredictable rebels. When the fifty page agreement was signed seven months ago, most Mozambicans and international experts doubted that the cease-fire would hold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Almost miraculously, the guns on both sides fell silent and the cease-fire has been faithfully observed. But few of the other provisions of the agreement have yet been implemented and the whole agreement could collapse. There are grounds for concern that without action by the UN and key international actors, the failed peace process in Angola could be tragically repeated in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Steps need to be taken:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. to renegotiate the overall timetable for implementation of the agreement;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">June 9, 1993--The massacre Saturday night of 300-400 Liberian at a camp for displaced persons 35 miles from the Liberian capital, Monrovia, provides the latest gruesome evidence that LiberiaUs civil war, now in its fourth year and largely forgotten by the international community, is no closer to resolution and is, in many ways, regressing to levels of atrocities not seen since its first year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Committee for Refugees (USCR) strongly condemns the massacre of defenseless displaced persons last weekend and hopes that (the June 9, 1993) hearings on Liberia by the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa will build more international pressure for a final peaceful resolution to the Liberian civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This press advisory provides additional facts and analysis of the massacre, and recommends steps to improve security and bring the war in Liberia closer to resolution. THE MASSACRE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rebel soldiers of the National Patriotic Front (NPFL), under the command of rebel leader Charles Taylor, are accused of perpetuating the massacre that reportedly left as many as 300 dead and 700 wounded. Many of the 300-400 killed were reportedly dismembered and disemboweled.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The slaughter occurred at Harbel, a large abandoned rubber plantation 35 miles from the capital, Monrovia, shortly after midnight Saturday night.  Some 35,000 displaced Liberians had settles in a temporary camp there after fleeing battles two months ago between the NPFL and the West African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG. ECOMOG had reportedly told the displaced persons that Harbel was safe. It is believed that NPFL troops slipped through ECOMOG lines to reach Harbel. The rebel troops reportedly entered the camp and identified themselves as government soldiers in need of food. The rebels began the massacre after receiving food from camp residents. ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The massacre at Harbel bring the Liberian civil war full circle. It was the dead-of-night massacre of some 300 innocent men, women and children who had sought sanctuary at St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Monrovia in July 1990 -- almost exactly three years ago -- which hastened the initial military intervention by ECOMOG peacekeeping troops in August 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest atrocity indicated that the Liberian war remains far from a peaceful resolution and that the U.S. and the rest of the international community cannot continue to stand idly by waiting for the Liberian conflict to resolve itself. The war has killed an estimated 60,000 persons and uprooted some 1.2 million Liberians -- more than half the country's population. Mass graves recently found in proximity to Monrovia indicate that numerous other unreported massacres have occurred in the past year. The massacre at Harbel comes less than a month after unconfirmed charges that the NPFL slaughtered 100 civilians in the town of Fassama, near Liberia's border with Guinea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rebel leader Charles Taylor, whose military forces are weakened but far from defeated, has vowed that he will prolong Liberia's agony through guerrilla warfare and terrorist tactics. Liberia's forested terrain and the NPFL's familiarity with local languages make Taylor's threat credible. The Liberian conflict, moreover, has fractured into</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">no fewer that four armies: the NPFL, ECOMOG, former government troops known as the Armed Forces of Liberia, and former refugees and government soldiers known as the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO).  This makes peace more elusive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. Committee for Refugees urges the following</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">steps: 1. Congress and the U.S. State Department should strongly condemn last weekend's massacre and insist on a rapid investigation by the United Nations. -------------------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. should demand a full, immediate and rapid UN investigation into the massacre/ The UN investigative team now en route to Monrovia should conclude its probe before July 1 and make all findings public. The UN should also investigate other human rights atrocities, such as last October's murder of five American nuns, which has never been investigated. 2.  ECOMOG must provide protection for Liberians displaced within Liberia.  -------------------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ECOMOG forces should routinely provide security patrols at camps for displaced persons, especially those near battle lines. Security should not be the responsibility of AFL troops, who themselves have a record of committing human rights abuses. If ECOMOG cannot provide adequate security, ECOMOG, should, at a minimum, refrain from assuring uprooted citizens that they are safe when in fact they are not. As a result of last weekend's massacre, UN refugee officials reportedly will transfer some 60,000 displaced Liberians into Monrovia for protection, where they will join several hundred thousand other uprooted Liberians already living there in crowded conditions. Tents and financial assistance from the international community are required. 3.  Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring Guinea and Ivory Coast should receive additional protection to guard against similar atrocities in their camps along the Liberian border.  -------------------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some 385,000 Liberian refugees have taken refuge have taken in Guinea, and nearly 200,000 in Ivory Coast. Many of these refugee settlements are in remote areas. Rebel leader Taylor has threatened to extend the war into neighboring countries as punishment to ECOMOG member, and Liberian refugees are prime targets. The Harbel massacre could be repeated on a larger scale.  International financial assistance from the U.S. and other Western nations may be necessary to make such security deployments possible. 4. Congress and the U.S. State Department should urge the UN to station human rights monitors in Liberia. The U.S. and the UN should exert renewed pressure for a return to the Yamoussoukro IV peace process and a final peaceful resolution to the conflict. -------------------------------------------------</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All four armies operating in Liberia are guilty of abuses and should be monitored by international observers. In the long term, the Yamoussoukro IV accord, signed in 1991, continues to offer a process for peace. -301025 Vermont Avenue, NW, Suite 920, Washington, DC 20005;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I refer to Mr. Mobutu as a former President because his term of office expired in December 1991, and because a full understanding of questions of sovereignty and legitimacy is absolutely critical if we are to promote peaceful change in Zaire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Past hearings before this subcommittee have examined the terrible human rights abuses in Zaire, the impoverishment of its people and the destruction of its infrastructure and human service structures.  Witnesses at your last full hearing on Zaire, in November 1991, convincingly explained why Mobutu's failure to relinquish power was already plunging Zaire into chaos and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conditions have grown immeasurably worse since then, and every day that Mobutu delays his departure makes it more likely that Zaire will become the next Liberia or the next Somalia.  However, rather than offering a potentially endless account of the latest abuses, I will focus my testimony on</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the key question facing policymakers: what can our government do -- both unilaterally and in cooperation with others -- to help the people of Zaire speedily and peacefully complete their transition to democracy. Because economic pressures offer the last hope for peaceful transition, my testimony will draw on research I have conducted, as a journalist specializing in African economic affairs, on the Zairian economy under the Mobutu regime.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Without belaboring the point, I will also touch on the reasons our government has an especially strong obligation to help undo the great damage wrought by its past support for Mobutu and encouragement of some of his most corrupt practices.  Secretary of State Christopher heralded a long overdue policy reversal at the African American Institute last month, when he declared that Africa's future lies &quot;not with corrupt dictators like Mobutu, but with courageous democrats in every part of the continent.&quot; Yet these words will have little practical meaning unless they lead to swift and effective action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE ECONOMIC CONTEXT: MOBUTU'S SYSTEM</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To act effectively, we need a sophisticated understanding Mobutu's system of rule, often referred to as &quot;kleptocracy&quot; or government by theft.  For the past 28 years, Mobutu has carefully and thoughtfully refined this system for transforming the public resources of Zaire into private wealth, while using bribery, coercion and violence to thwart all movements for change.  This system has transformed wealth which rightly belongs to Zaire's 40 million people into a personal business empire serving the private interests of one man and his tiny circle of supporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A vast body of evidence suggests that, through most of the past quarter century, Mobutu has misappropriated several hundred million dollars annually.  In the years for which the most detailed evidence is available, Mobutu and his associates have mis-directed up to 20% of the Zairian government operating budget, up to 30% of mineral export revenues, up to 50% of the government capital budget.  Mobutu uses these funds for luxury consumption, for personal investment abroad, for corrupt payments to political allies, and for other activities which fall completely outside the parameters of legitimate governance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Past attempts to &quot;reform&quot; Mobutu ended in utter failure.  Perhaps the most serious such effort came during the Carter administration when -- partly at the behest of the United States -- the International Monetary Fund sent a senior international banker to monitor the Zairian Central Bank and promote financial integrity.  That banker, Erwin Blumenthal, soon left in frustration, declaring that &quot;the corruptive system in Zaire with all its wicked and ugly manifestations, its mismanagement and fraud will destroy all endeavors&quot; for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least four types of financial flows have served to enrich Mobutu.  In recent years, he has relied primarily upon funds taken from (1) Zaire's treasury, (2) Zaire's mineral export revenues and (3) foreign aid and investment funds.  In the past, Mobutu also benefited significantly from covert payments by foreign governments, including the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DIVERSION OF STATE FUNDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Zairian state treasury itself has provided Mobutu his most reliable and consistent source of funds. Unpublished studies prepared by the World Bank and the IMF show that direct government appropriations to Mobutu's presidential office have often consumed fifteen to twenty percent of the government's operating budget.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet these generous appropriations were not sufficient to satisfy Mobutu's demand for wealth.  The same confidential financial studies also show that Mobutu has consistently overspent his &quot;official&quot; presidential appropriation, making up the deficit by taking funds designated for public services.  Particularly detailed records are available for the 1986 fiscal year.  In that year, Mobutu's parliament allocated about $60 million to the Presidency and Mobutu- controlled political organizations.  However, the Presidency and government-funded political offices actually drew $172 million -- 16% of the year's total government operating expenditure -- from the Zairian treasury.  Mobutu's additional expenditures were taken from the budgets of the Health Ministry, Education Ministry and other key ministries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Further evidence exists of Mobutu-directed spending for which no meaningful records can be found.  A 1989 World Bank memo showed, for example, that fully 18% of the year's state expenditures were spent for unexplained &quot;other goods and services.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This massive mis-spending leaves almost no money for legitimate government functions.  World Bank figures indicate that, among all developing nations for which data is available, Zaire devotes the smallest percentage of official spending to human services.  In 1990, education received only 1.4% of Zairian government outlays; health, 0.7%; other social services, 1.5%.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> EMBEZZLEMENT OF EXPORT PROCEEDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Export revenues provide Mobutu his most important source of hard currency.  Identifiable &quot;leakages&quot; often exceed $100 million per year.  In 1988, for example, $400 million disappeared without explanation from Zaire's mineral export proceeds.  This represented about 30% of the annual revenue of the company involved, the state-owned copper and cobalt mining firm, Gcamines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consistent reports of similar diversions date back to the founding of Zaire's state minerals marketing system in 1974.  In some cases, the exact destination of diverted funds remains a mystery; in others, direct evidence exists that Mobutu or members of his family were the beneficiaries. These abuses have helped to drive Gcamines to the brink of collapse. Its output -- once the mainstay of Zaire's formal sector economy -- has dropped by two-thirds in recent years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite ample evidence of past abuses, international institutions appear to have continued some lending to Gcamines.  As recently as Monday of this week, the Mobutu- appointed President Director General of Gcamines reported that the company is the recipient of some continuing World Bank credits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mobutu may now be planning one final raid on Gcamines assets, through a recently announced plan to privatize major portions of the company.  Whatever the ultimate merits of privatization, if carried out under present conditions it will merely provide Mobutu another opportunity for embezzlement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Copper and cobalt are not the only sources of mineral revenue diversions.  Over the past year, diamond smuggling appears to have replaced copper and cobalt exports as Mobutu's primary foreign exchange source.  Some reports suggest that diamond exporters with close ties to Mobutu, his family, or his generals may have netted as much as $300 million last year. MISUSE OF FOREIGN AID, FOREIGN LOANS AND FOREIGN INVESTOR FUNDS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a long history of systematic Mobutist misappropriation of foreign aid grants and multilateral development loans.  As early as 1975, during a hearing before this very subcommittee, former Senator Dick Clark raised questions about reports that $5 million worth of foreign aid was being annually diverted to &quot;private officials of the Mobutu government.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last year, a committee of Zaire's Sovereign National Conference (the predecessor to the High Council of the Republic) found -- during it investigation of &quot;misacquired wealth&quot; -- evidence that Mobutu received kickbacks totalling 7% of expenditures for the Inga-Shaba power line, the largest construction project in Zaire's history.  The project was partly financed with guarantees from the U.S. Import-Export bank.  If the full history of Zaire's foreign borrowing is ever reconstructed, it may show that most of the nation's foreign debt, which totals more than $10 billion, arises from loans whose proceeds were stolen or squandered. DIRECT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BRIBES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We as Americans cannot ignore our own government's role in establishing Mobutu's patterns of corruption. Roger Morris, who handled African affairs for the National Security Council in the Johnson and Nixon administrations, has estimated that Mobutu received close to $150 million in bribes and secret payments from the Central Intelligence Agency during the first decade or so of his regime.  In more recent years, there have been credible accusations which deserve further investigation involving financial flows in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the opposite direction: irregular funds transfers possibly made by Mobutu to U.S. and European business officials who have lobbied their governments on his behalf. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the arrival of a new administration, many Zairians hoped the U.S.  would take leadership in organizing multilateral pressure for Mobutu's rapid departure. The Clinton Administration has sent some welcome signals.  It has placed an appropriate stress on its opposition to Mobutu, its recognition of the High Council of the Republic and Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi as Zaire's legitimate transitional political authorities, and its support for anti- Mobutu sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the administration's expressed support for international sanctions against Mobutu has not yet been translated into action. As we have seen elsewhere, most recently in the case of Haiti, sanctions delayed swiftly become sanctions evaded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past, some officials have suggested that the U.S. must await the preparation of a comprehensive multilateral plan of action before imposing sanctions against Mobutu.  While multilateral action is important, I believe the urgency of Zaire's crisis permits no further delays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At least five potentially fruitful types of pressure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">against Mobutu have been proposed:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) Actions aimed directly at his personal fortune, including</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> a freeze on his foreign bank accounts and those of his</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> family and political associates;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) Economic sanctions directed against the Mobutu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> government, including formal suspension of Zaire from the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IMF and World Bank;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) Sanctions aimed at Mobutu's sources of foreign currency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> income, including an embargo on Zaire's copper, cobalt and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> other exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) An arms embargo designed to deprive Mobutu of weapons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> used to suppress opposition;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5) Diplomatic action, including expulsion of Mobutu's ambassadors from Western capitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If well-designed, these and similar measures could isolate Mobutu and facilitate his departure before Zaire collapses into full-fledged civil war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet the proposed sanctions must be creatively broadened if it is to have any real effect.  Moreover, the isolation of Mobutu should be coupled with efforts to strengthen the HCR and the Tshisekedi cabinet which are, however imperfect, the only institutions in Zaire with a legitimate claim to represent the political will of the nation.  In designing an effective sanctions package, the following factors must be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">considered:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1) An assets freeze limited to bank accounts will have relatively little effect, because bank deposits probably represent only a small fraction of Mobutu's wealth.  To be effective, a freeze must also encompass real estate holdings; equity interests in a variety of foreign business ventures; and all other identifiable assets purchased from the profits of kleptocracy.  Moreover, a freeze should be explicitly designed as the first step toward the seizure of ill-gotten assets; the possible prosecution of Mobutu and his associates for any financial crimes they have committed; and the repatriation of illegally-obtained wealth to Zaire when a legitimate government assumes effective power in Kinshasa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since Mobutu appears to be haunted by the prospect of a Marcos-like exile in which he and his family will be hounded to their graves by a successor state bent on recovering ill- gotten wealth, there is a carrot which might be tied to this &quot;stick.&quot; I suspect that, if Mobutu agreed to renounce power and accept permanent exile, Zairians would welcome a compromise which allowed him a safe haven abroad with some form of immunity from prosecution and assets seizure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2) Economic pressures should be targeted against the Mobutu- Faustin Birindwa government which, despite its lack of legitimacy or international recognition, holds effective control over Zaire's government ministries.  This government's suspension from the World Bank and IMF should be coupled with moves toward recognition of the HCR-Tshisekedi transitional government as the representative of Zaire in all multilateral bodies and negotiations.  Some steps were taken in this direction last month, when senior officials at the IMF and World Bank met with Tshisekedi's widely-respected finance minister, Jules Sambwa.  However, there are disturbing indications that the World Bank -- which alone among multilateral lending institutions continues to disburse funds to Zaire -- may still be cooperating with Gcamines, with the Office des Routes, and with other historically corrupt entities still under Mobutu's control.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Immediate action is also needed to isolate Zaire's Central Bank, which is operated by a Mobutu appointee in defiance of the HCR and currently serves partly to launder diamond smuggling proceeds.  This rogue institution should be excluded from all international transactions and funds transfer systems until Mobutu relinquishes control.  Mobutu's power could be further undermined through an embargo on the currency notes, printed abroad, which he uses to pay his security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Increased public disclosure and transparency on the part of lenders and aid donors could also help speed Mobutu's departure and assist Zairian efforts to investigate the &quot;misacquired wealth&quot; of Mobutu and his associates.  Lender and donor agencies -- including the World Bank, the IMF and the US Agency for International Development -- should be directed to provide investigators active assistance.  Records held by these and other international agencies could prove invaluable in tracking misdirected funds.  The mere threat of public disclosure might be a useful source of leverage encouraging Mobutu's retirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3) An arms embargo is symbolically important but may have only modest impact, since Mobutu has a monopoly on arms already in the country.  However, a report last year by Africa Watch indicated that several countries -- including Egypt, Israel and South Africa -- may be providing advisors or other vital support to Mobutu's military.  In addition to embargoing weapons, the U.S. should use all available means to press these and other governments to sever military links with Mobutu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4) Because Mobutu's destructive regime has already driven the copper and cobalt mines to a virtual standstill, diamonds are the most important target for any export embargo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Embargoing diamonds is virtually impossible since any smuggler can carry several hundred thousand dollars worth in his or her pocket.  Nonetheless, authorities in Antwerp, Tel Aviv, New York and other major diamond cutting centers would -- if determined to do so -- have relatively little difficulty pinpointing the major buyers and sellers of Zairian precious stones.  If an embargo were coupled with close observation of Mobutu's customers and harsh prosecution when violators are caught, they will quickly turn to other diamond sources.  A ban on air links with Zaire would also help to greatly reduce the flow of smuggled mineral products.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So that these anti-theft measures won't rebound against Zaire's 40 million citizens, they should be coupled with a program of greatly increased humanitarian aid.  Humanitarian assistance should be funnelled through non-government organizations, not through agencies controlled by the Mobutu- Birindwa government.  The U.S. should support and encourage speedy completion of a planned UN assessment of humanitarian need and the broadest possible multilateral aid effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5) Expulsion of Mobutu's ambassadors and diplomats should be viewed as merely the first step toward international recognition of the transitional government. Though the U.S. and the European Community have repeatedly declared that they view the HCR as Zaire's highest legitimate authority, Mobutu-appointed ambassadors still occupy most Zairian embassies, including the embassy in Washington.  In addition to according recognition only to representatives chosen by the transitional government, the U.S. should insist that U.S. corporations operating in Zaire pay taxes only to the legitimate authorities and halt any payments to the Mobutu-Birindwa government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I realize that some of these recommendations lack precedent in the history of international economic sanctions. Yet nothing less will work if Zaire is to be afforded any chance of achieving peaceful political transition. -30(saskin@igc.apc.org.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observing the events in Somalia over the past 29 months, and after my years of residence in that country, it is eminently clear that Mohamed Farah Aideed is indeed a world class criminal! He is responsible for creating anarchy and chaos by giving American and Soviet arms to teens, thugs and other irresponsible elements in the society without being able or willing to exercise appropriate discipline or control. He calls these criminals his &quot;followers!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With Aideed's help and encouragement, these armed hoodlums ravaged and pillaged the country. They raped and murdered innocent civilians and they looted convoys and warehouses of the food and supplies intended for the starving population. They fired on relief ships in the harbor in an effort to discourage UN intervention and the distribution of humanitarian aid. With their guns, they held hostage an innocent, starving civilian population while Aideed supplied a barrage of propaganda. Aideed lusts for the power to loot the treasury and to control the country's commercial activities for his own benefit. He has proven that he can create anarchy and chaos but not that he can govern! Above all others, he is the reason armed UN intervention was needed!</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aideed is an obvious criminal and not the head of a government so I see no reason for the UN not to offer a substantial reward, payable in U.S.  dollars, for his capture. If this is coupled with an offer of safe-keeping in a country of his choice for the captor and his family, Aideed's prompt capture can be expected. Aideed is not popular outside Mogadishu except with a few clans of the Hawiye tribe. This would be cost effective! Further, this action taken quickly will induce respect for the UN and help stem the tide of anti-Americanism in Somalia and erosion of popular support in this country resulting from the civilian deaths.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Consideration sand discussion of the matter by the UN Security Council should be kept secret, if possible, until the UN military command is ready to announce the terms. In the meantime, UN troops should be equipped with tear gas and launchers to enable them to control crowds, and break up demonstrations, without civilian casualties.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Department of State has terminated the domestic arms embargo against Angola. Section 126.1(a) of the ITAR is being amended to reflect this change in policy with respect to the commercial export of defense articles and services to Angola. Effective immediately, it is the policy of the U.S. Government to review all licenses and approvals authorizing the export or other transfer of defense services to Angola on a case-by-case basis, with a presumption of denial for lethal articles.  Approvals for export of defense articles or defense services bound for Angola will be considered for non-lethal defense articles or services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the purposes of this policy, &quot;nonlethal defense articles&quot; means an article that is not a weapon, ammunition, or other equipment or material that is designed to inflict serious bodily harm or death. (See, e.g., 10 U.S.C. n 2547)</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ever since the United Nations General Assembly voted in December last year to condemn the human rights violations by the Khartoum regime, the debate has continued about whether the international community has both the right and the will to intervene in Sudan. The Islamic Fundamentalist military regime has reacted negatively to such talk but that was only to be expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There appears to be a misconception amongst many that an intervention in Sudan would need to be a military one. That is not the case at all.  Military intervention is only ever a last resort, and will usually happen only when one side or the other ceases to cooperate with a humanitarian or political intervention. Humanitarian intervention in Sudan has been a way of life since 1984 and political intervention has occurred sporadically in one form or another over the same period. Recent efforts to end the conflict, such as the talks at Abuja, Nigeria in April and May, have involved foreign mediation which is probably the commonest form of political intervention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to understand why a great deal of fuss is being made about the prospect of intervention from certain Sudanese politicians who have no links with the Khartoum regime. While the regime's negative response is understandable, there is less so. It seems that they are</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">opposed to intervention on two grounds: firstly, that Sudan's state sovereignty question would be impinged upon and, secondly, that an intervention would impose unacceptable political conditions on a future Sudan. The sovereignty question is easily dealt with because it is based on the false belief that it is the land which is sovereign rather that the people. The second fear can only be allayed by providing more facts and information to this group about precisely what an intervention would hope to achieve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Khartoum, a minority grouping seized power in a coup d'etat in June 1989. In the years since, that minority grouping has systematically terrorised sections of the population. All forms of political dissent have been suppressed and famine has been used as a weapon of war. The Nuba people of Southern Kordofan have become the victims of an ethnic cleansing programme. International observers have been denied access to most parts of the country. The minority grouping has been accused of exporting terrorism to neighbouring countries. All manner of international diplomatic conventions have been abused and violated by the minority grouping and in December 1992 it was condemned for its abysmal human rights record by the International Commission for Human Rights in Geneva. All of the above activities by the Khartoum regime have been well documented and made known to the international community. The question ought not to be whether there should be an intervention but when it should be initiated and what form it should take.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It ought to be obvious that the Khartoum regime is opposed to intervention because it is desperate to cling on to power and wishes to cover up the crimes it has committed whilst in power. If human rights violations had not been committed in the first place, intervention would have never gotten on to the international agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those people around the world who will eventually make the decision to intervene or not in Sudan should not allow themselves to be persuaded into inaction by the arguments mentioned so far. There is a basis for an intervention both in international law and in the human rights covenants. The crimes committed against the Sudanese people by the Khartoum regime have been well documented and provide justification enough for an intervention. Perhaps the only question to remain unanswered is whether the international community has the will to intervene in Sudan. The GAZETTE hopes and prays that it does.  The time has come for the world to unfold its arms and to confront this rogue regime head on. Bona Malwal Editor and Publisher Sudan Democratic Gazette</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I. BASIC PRINCIPLES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. South Africa has reached a crucial stage on the path to democracy.  After centuries of colonial domination and apartheid, our country is poised for a major breakthrough leading to the establishment of a united, non- racial, non-sexist and democratic order and a government based on the will of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The achievements made thus far are a result of the efforts and sacrifices made by the people of our country and international support for a democratic settlement. The people's aspirations will find expression in democratic elections for a government of their choice, and measures aimed at reconstructing our country to the benefit of all and bringing about national reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. The ANC and the IFP recognise the historic importance of this moment. We jointly reaffirm our commitment to the speedy resolution of the problems that remain so that our society can at least find peace and occupy its rightful place among the world community of nations.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Violence remains one of the most serious impediments in the endeavor to realise these objectives. The ANC and the IFP acknowledge that every life lost is a serious indictment on the system of apartheid, our own organisations as well as other political leaders; and that it behoves all peace-loving South Africans to engender within our communities the spirits of peace and tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. On behalf of the ANC and the IFP, we hereby reaffirm our commitment to the agreements reached in previous bilateral meetings as well as the National Peace Accord. We jointly commit ourselves to reaching an agreement together with the other signatories to strengthen the National Peace Accord, and to abide by its strengthened provisons. We hereby commit ourselves to the peaceful resolution of the problems of our country, and to a constructive approach in dealing with matters under discussion in multi-party negotiations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to help contribute to the atmosphere necessary for a peaceful transition to democracy, we commit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">ourselves to the following principles:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> II. ORGANISATIONAL RELATIONS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The IFP and the ANC are two independent organisation founded to pursue what each organisation perceives as the interest of the country and its people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. The two organisations share the common objective of ridding SA of the scourge of apardheid and its consequences. Insofar as we share these common perspectives, we are duty- bound to co-operate in their realisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Where the ANC and IFP differ on mechanisms to this end, we commit ourselves to discus these differences in a spirit of tolerance and mutual respect, taking into account that the interests of SA and its people trancend these differences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. It is therefore the responsibility of both organisations to ensure that our supporters, members and particularly leaders at all levels, promote a healthy relationship between them based on such mutual respect and tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> III. NORMAL POLITICAL ACTIVITY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. The common objectives that the two organisations as well as other parties share, require that there be an atmosphere of peace among all South Africans, freedom of association, assembly and other basic human rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. We therefore commit ourselves to promote the creation of such an atmosphere, and to do all in our power to prevent violations of these principles by our members and supporters. In particular, urgent measures need to be undertaken to ensure free political activity throughout SA. This entails, inter alia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.1 The recognition by our members and supporters of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> right of all individuals to hold their own views, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> their right to express these views without intimidation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and violence; while at the same time echewing mutual</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> vilification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.2 Where either of our organisations are able to do so canvass their views and that they are afforded the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> we shall ensure that other organisations are allowed to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> necessary facilities to do so. This should apply to both</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> urban and rural areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.3 Both the IFP and ANC recognise the right of people to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> assemble and give expression to their grievances and the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> parties they support provided that such manifestations</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> are in keeping with the letter and spirit of the National</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Peace Accord. To this end the IFP and the ANC agree that</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> if and when either party convenes a demonstration,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> protest or any other form of mass action, it will ensure</SPAN></P>

&nbsp;effective&nbsp;means&nbsp;of<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communications&nbsp;between&nbsp;the&nbsp;conveners&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;action,<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marshals,&nbsp;peace&nbsp;committee&nbsp;monitors,&nbsp;the&nbsp;police&nbsp;and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any&nbsp;other&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;party&nbsp;during&nbsp;the&nbsp;action&nbsp;and<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;thereafter.<BR> 3. Realising that the problem of violence and legitimate law enforcement should also be addressed in the context of the unfolding transitions, we commit ourselves to contribute constructively to the multilateral negotiaions on multiparty control of all armed formations. In particular, we agree that all proposals regarding armed formations in the country should be considered in the light of a single, over-riding objective; to establish impartial, accountable, effective and legitimate security forces for a democratic South Africa. To this end, we specifically endorse the proposals made in the Fourth Report of the Technical Committee on Violence at the Multi-Party Negotiating Process regarding the adoption of a series of phased, confidence building measures within a common framework to achieve this objective. We recognise that within this common framework a clear distinction will have to be drawn between statutory and non-statutory armies on the one hand and police forces on the other during the transition to democracy and thereafter. This distinction is consistent with our view that policing functions should be clearly distinguished from military functions and our view that the various armies should play no role in the election process which lies before us, while the various police forces and a multi-party peace-keeping force will be required to fulfil ongoing law and order functions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. Where there are disputes between us, including disputes regarding either party's freedom to canvass its views and be afforded the necessary facilities to do so or regarding the exercise of the right to freedom of assembly, we agree to attempt to resolve these disputes in a constructive manner. We agree that the primary mechanisms for dispute resolution between us are those contained in the National Peace Accord and direct meetings and liaison between our two organisations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Realising that apartheid and the variety of struggles against it have had particularly serious consequences for South Africa's youth, and that there is a need to constructively channel the energies and hope of the youth, we commit ourselves to participate together in the development of a peace-corps/youth services under the auspices of the National Peace Accord.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IV JOINT MECHANISMS</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. In order to promote healthy and contructive interaction between our organisations, we commit ourselves to strengthen and expedite the work of the joint liaison structures between our two organisations. We call on these structures to speed up their work aimed at finalising detailed agreements on matters of mutual concern for ratification by the respective executives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. In order to obviate some of the problems that beset relations between the two organisations after previous bilateral meetings, we agree that such joint mechanisms should include measures aimed at monitoring progress in the implementation programmes agreed upon and dealing with such violations as may occur. Further, we pledge to ensure that problems that arise in this relationship will be handled first and foremost through the channels agreed upon rather through the media; and that such contact will not be broken off simply as a result of differences that might emerge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. In the endeavor to ensure that the relations between our organisations find expression among the people, we undertake to initiate and encourage activities among our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">structures at all levels. this will include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.1 Joint mass rallies, meetings and marches by local as well as regional structures - which should be undertaken as a matter of urgency to relate to one another in this spirit of co-operation, mutual respect and tolerance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. None among us should see it necessary, no matter how serious the point of disagreement, to resort to violence. Those who seek to exploit whatever differences may exist between the two organisations for their own ends, will then stick out like a sore thumb.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. Great possibilities exist for the final resolution of the political problems that have gripped our country for decades and even centuries. We owe it to ourselves, our children and generations to come, not to squander this historic opportunity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. The future of peace and democracy for which many have sacrificed their lives is within reach. Let us grasp it with both hands.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CAIRO--Summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) A year ago I met with this distinguished assembly of African leaders in Dakar, and it is that meeting that we resume today in a spirit of love and friendship.  I say &quot;resume&quot; because it is a meeting that has never ended.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, in Cairo, at the outset of my talk with you, I should like to extend my greetings to His Excellency President Abdou Diouf, and in so doing, I also express my sincere thanks and appreciation for the role played by President Diouf personally during Senegal's chairmanship of the Organization of African Unity, during which African issues were followed in depth and with genuine sincerity. This had an excellent effect on cooperation and coordination between the OAU and the United Nations at all levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I should like to take this opportunity to note with admiration and appreciation this active role.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also a pleasure for me to draw particular attention to the positive, influential role played by the Secretary-General of the OAU, Salim Ahmed Salim, and to his solicitude in supporting cooperation among the various agencies of the two organizations and his endeavours to promote constant coordination on all African issues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am particularly pleased to extend special greetings to President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak, who is to assume the leadership of the Organization of African Unity for the coming year. Greetings to you, Mr. President, and through you to the people of Egypt, to whom I am proud to belong. Greetings to every Egyptian man and woman in this excellent land and greetings especially to Cairo, the immortal African city on the banks of whose river Nile the first African summit conference was held and which is today hosting the twenty-ninth such conference.  Today's summit is not just another ordinary sessional meeting -- it marks the culmination of 30 years of existence of the Organization of African Unity, which was the dream, the goal and the labour of the early pioneers of the liberation movement and has become the springboard, forum and framework for joint African action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The holding of these two summit conferences in Cairo is not due to mere coincidence or chance, for Egypt's historical record testifies to the African role played by Egypt in supporting African liberation movements, in fostering and assisting the process of independence on this continent, in fighting against colonialism and racial discrimination, in participating and playing an active role in the founding of the Organization of African Unity and in working constructively to promote development and progress for the peoples of Africa.  Ahmad Hishmet Pasha Street, in the Zamalek district, where the headquarters of the African Society, Egypt, is located, will remain a symbol of independence, of struggle and of freedom in Africa, for Cairo has been a witness to the struggle of leaders who have gloriously led their nations to freedom and independence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a pleasure for me today to congratulate, here in Egypt, the free State of Eritrea on joining the family of African nations after our celebration, this past 28 May, of its joining the international community and becoming the 182nd member of the United Nations.  I should like on this occasion to salute President Issaias Afwerki and to extend to him and to the people of Eritrea heartfelt congratulations.  That event in itself has special significance, confirming as it does the importance and soundness of the organization of African States and its ability to take up challenges and continue realizing the goals of its charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so, just as the spark of the first summit conference was struck in Cairo, so will today's summit give new impetus towards a more brilliant future of greater growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than any other region, Africa displays the vast range of United Nations activities for peace, democracy and development. Development assistance, humanitarian relief, regional cooperation, human rights, preventive diplomacy and peacemaking have all been important areas of United Nations activity in Africa during the past year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I wish to begin this survey of United Nations activities in Africa with a few encouraging words on the increasingly important role that the United Nations is playing in assisting Africa's process of self- democratization.  A sincere commitment to self- democratization must remain our common focus.  While set- backs have occurred and progress cannot be taken for granted, the general trend towards self-democratization in Africa has been both positive and encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am pleased to report to you that electoral assistance has been an area of substantial United Nations activity in Africa during the past year.  Since the establishment of the United Nations Electoral Assistance Unit, the United Nations has provided electoral assistance to 46 Member States -- a majority of which are located in Africa.  Requests for electoral assistance from African countries have included requests for technical and operational assistance, election monitoring and United Nations verification.  Electoral assistance has now become a key feature of virtually every United Nations peacemaking initiative now under way -- including those taking place in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Somalia, the United Nations is presently engaged in its most ambitious and comprehensive undertaking ever. Years of civil war and factional fighting had resulted in the widespread destruction of the country's infrastructure, and in the complete breakdown of all governmental authority. Famine, social upheaval and massive population displacement were the realities that the United Nations confronted in Somalia.  In 1992 alone, between 300,000 and 500,000 Somalis died -- mostly young children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II), the first stage of the United Nations effort in Somalia, responded directly to the immediate humanitarian crisis that the country faced.  Unfortunately, due to the widespread anarchy, looting and conflict that then prevailed in Somalia, the delivery of humanitarian aid could not be secured and the situation continued to deteriorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In response, the Security Council in December 1992, by resolution 794 (1992), authorized the establishment of a unified command for Somalia -- UNITAF -- with a mandate to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations throughout the country.  In March 1993, the Council voted to authorize UNOSOM II -- resolution 814 (1993) -- giving it a mandate to continue disarmament and pacification, and to work towards fostering national reconciliation, dialogue and the strengthening of political institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNOSOM II will include a force of 28,000 military and 2,800 civilian personnel from 32 countries, plus a Quick Reaction Force of 1,200 United States troops that can be deployed anywhere in Somalia within 24 hours.  To date, six African countries have contributed troops for the Somalia operations -- Morocco, Nigeria, Egypt, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Tunisia.  Contingents from Zambia and Uganda will be in place before the end of July.  I want to express here my gratitude for these African contributions and for this concrete expression of African solidarity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the temporary disruption in activities that has occurred in recent weeks, UNOSOM II has now begun the process of restoring to the people of Somalia the sovereignty and integrity of their State.  Throughout the country, the situation is very much improved.  Food aid has reached the starving, violence has been curtailed, order is being restored and the process of reconstructing Somalia has begun.  The close collaboration between the United Nations, the OAU, the Organization of the Islamic Conference and the Arab League, has greatly assisted all aspects of the United Nations operation in Somalia, and has ensured that the process of encouraging political reconciliation and development is conducted in a manner that is appropriately sensitive to local needs, issues and concerns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None the less, the costs of intervention in Somalia have been extraordinarily high.  In human terms, 30 United Nations peace-keepers and two United Nations personnel from the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have lost their lives in the international effort to assist the people of Somalia.  A further 90 United Nations peace-keepers have been wounded in this effort -- many seriously.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to the human costs, the financial costs of intervening in Somalia have also been high.  The cost of military operations during the first six months alone exceeded $600 million.  The total military costs for the first 18 months will likely exceed $1.6 billion.  In addition, the United Nations has now formulated a $160 million 1993 Programme for the Relief and Rehabilitation of Somalia, targeting the re-establishment of local administrative capacity, the creation of employment opportunities, the repatriation of refugees and displaced persons, the expansion of agriculture and livestock, and the re-establishment of primary education and vocational training.  Pledges of $130 million have so far been made for the 1993 Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Somalia is slowly beginning to recover.  This recovery cannot, and will not be allowed to fail because of the reckless and irresponsible actions of a few anti-democratic elements.  The calculated and deliberate attacks that have been directed by certain factions against United Nations personnel in Somalia must be condemned in the strongest possible terms.  It is in the interests of the international community and of the people of Somalia that the perpetrators of these criminal acts be found and that they be held fully accountable for their actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the Sudan, the ongoing conflict in the south of the country has made an already difficult humanitarian situation much worse.  The United Nations has intensified and expanded humanitarian relief programmes throughout the country in order to cope with the effects of drought and civil war.  The United Nations has also maintained a broad range of basic development programmes in the Sudan targeting health, nutrition, water, sanitation and agriculture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In 1992, approximately 5.5 million persons affected by drought in the Sudan required emergency food aid.  It is expected that this number will be reduced to 1.1 million in 1993, if the expectation of a generally good harvest holds true.  To address these needs, the United Nations has appealed for $205 million in humanitarian assistance to the Sudan, including $130 million for food aid requirements and $75 million for non-food rehabilitation assistance, such as health services and the provision of seeds and tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to focus greater international attention on the humanitarian crisis affecting the Sudan, I recently appointed a Special Envoy to the Sudan for humanitarian affairs.  The Special Envoy has begun consultations with all concerned parties on ways and means to meet humanitarian needs, including enhanced access to affected regions and better security for the delivery of relief supplies.  As part of this humanitarian effort, the United Nations also stands ready to support the current OAU-sponsored peace process in any capacity which the participants might deem useful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Eritrea, a United Nations mission -- the United Nations Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea (UNOVER) -- was given responsibility for verifying the agreed referendum on independence.  A mission composed of 21 international staff and 100 observers was authorized by the General Assembly.  The referendum achieved a 98 per cent turnout and a 99 per cent vote for independence.  The results were verified by the United Nations, and the referendum was officially certified by United Nations monitors to have been free and fair.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Working with the newly-installed Government of Eritrea, United Nations agencies have produced an $81 million consolidated appeal for humanitarian assistance to Eritrea.  Three quarters of Eritrea's population is at least partly dependent on food aid, and over 500,000 refugees must now be repatriated from neighbouring countries.  These challenges, together with the task of reconstructing and rebuilding Eritrea will require the active cooperation and assistance of the United Nations and of the international community for years to come.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is, therefore, particularly gratifying that one of the very first countries to recognize Eritrea's independence was Ethiopia.  On 28 May, I had the privilege of seeing the Eritrean flag raised for the first time at the United Nations, and of welcoming Eritrea as the 182nd Member State of the United Nations. The determination of Ethiopia and Eritrea to work together in meeting the challenges of the future is a source of great encouragement and a bright omen for the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Ethiopia itself, the number of people requiring assistance has dropped from 9 million in 1992 to 6.5 million in 1993, due primarily to increased food production and to intense health and nutrition activities.  An integrated inter-agency appeal has been launched to cover the $300 million cost of meeting present 1993 needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Rwanda, the United Nations has sought to lessen the risk of conflict breaking out between Rwanda and Uganda, while also working closely with the OAU to support the Arusha peace process between the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In separate letters to the Security Council in February 1993, the Governments of Rwanda and Uganda called for the deployment of United Nations military observers along their common border.  In April, I dispatched a technical mission to Uganda and Rwanda in order to gather relevant information.  In May, I recommended the establishment of the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda- Rwanda (UNOMUR).  Last week, the Security Council adopted a resolution establishing UNOMUR and authorizing the deployment of observers to the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In recommending the deployment of United Nations observers I noted that a decision to deploy observers to the Uganda/Rwanda border could also help to promote the negotiation process in Arusha and encourage the parties to actively pursue their efforts towards peace and national reconciliation in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To address the dire humanitarian consequences of the conflict in Rwanda, the United Nations has now launched an inter-agency appeal for $78 million in international assistance to meet the needs of the 900,000 displaced persons in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Liberia, the United Nations has worked closely with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the OAU to achieve a cease-fire and obtain adherence to the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement.  The ECOWAS has provided strong military and diplomatic leadership, fully supported by both the Security Council and the various political and humanitarian organs of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia is a good example of the type of cooperation between the United Nations and a regional organization that was envisaged in Chapter VIII of the Charter.  At the initiative of the ECOWAS, the Security Council convened on 19 November 1992 to consider the conflict in Liberia.  The Council adopted resolution 788 (1992) imposing an arms embargo on the country, urging the appointment of a special envoy for Liberia, and calling upon all parties to the conflict to respect and implement the cease-fire and other accords.  Shortly afterwards I named Trevor Gordon-Somers as my Special Representative for Liberia and dispatched him to the region to assess the situation and help mediate the conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following continued military engagements between the ECOWAS and the forces of Charles Taylor, the Security Council met again to consider Liberia in March 1993.  The Council expressed its continued support for the ECOWAS and for the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement, and declared its readiness to consider appropriate measures in support of the ECOWAS if any party was unwilling to cooperate in implementing the Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While a cease-fire has still not yet been agreed to, all sides have now agreed that upon the signing of such a cease-fire, the United Nations should be called upon to monitor implementation of the cease-fire and the Agreement. The parties have also agreed that the United Nations should subsequently be involved in monitoring the conduct of the election provided for under the Yamoussoukro IV Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most recently, following the brutal massacre of women and children at Harbel, Liberia, I instructed my Special Representative to go to Liberia, and to conduct a thorough investigation of this crime.  I wish again to express my extreme outrage at this incident and to make it clear to all concerned in the conflict in Liberia that such conduct cannot be tolerated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Given the extent of the damage and destruction caused by the civil war in Liberia, it will be necessary for the United Nations and the entire international community to support a comprehensive programme for reconstruction and development once peace has returned to the country.  To meet interim humanitarian needs, I have launched several appeals for humanitarian assistance to Liberia.  Of the total of $161 million requested, $104 million has so far been pledged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Western Sahara, the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) has now been in operation for two and a half years.  Although the Settlement Plan called for the referendum to be held in January 1992, a firm date for the referendum has still not yet been fixed. In March, the Security Council signalled its growing impatience with the slow pace of negotiations over the organization of the referendum, and set a deadline of the end of this year for the referendum to take place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Preparations for the referendum are being speeded up. In response to the Security Council's action, my Special Representative Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan, travelled to the mission area at the end of March for talks with the parties. On his return to New York, Mr. Yaqub-Khan reported to me that both Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO) had shown a desire to move towards an early referendum.  Against this background, and in response to calls from the parties, I visited the mission area in the first week of June in order to help reach a compromise solution on the remaining issues, and also to underscore the importance of implementing the Settlement Plan without further delay.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am pleased to report to you that as a result of these negotiations the differences between the parties have been substantially narrowed.  I am optimistic that agreement on the terms of reference for the referendum will soon be reached, and that this will help to generate momentum for the holding of the referendum at an early date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the meantime, preparations are continuing.  The initial deployment of civilian police officers to Western Sahara has now taken place, and the full deployment will proceed as required.  A 10-member Identification Commission for the referendum has now been established, and after the completion of essential preparatory activities, the Commission will begin voter registration.  Although it is now apparent that the budget of $143 million, which was approved by the General Assembly in May of 1991, will require additional support, I am hopeful that the concrete steps now under way will persuade the General Assembly to allocate the needed additional resources.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Mozambique, I am happy to report that the United Nations operation there -- United Nations Operation in Mozambique (ONUMOZ II) -- has now become fully operational. The Security Council and General Assembly have approved a budget of more than $330 million for the operation, and a United Nations force of about 7,100 military troops and civilian police has now been deployed.  This force includes contingents from six African countries -- Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau and Zambia.  I wish again to express my thanks and gratitude to these countries for their contributions and their solidarity, and also to express my appreciation to the Government of Zimbabwe for its transitional assistance prior to the arrival of United Nations forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the Rome Agreement, government and Mozambique National Resistance Movement (RENAMO) forces are to be demobilized and grouped into 49 United Nations-monitored assembly points. Following certain initial delays the demobilization process has now begun.  Full demobilization in accordance with the terms of the Agreement will be completed prior to the holding of United Nations verified elections.  It is expected that preparations for these elections will be completed by the middle of next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a new departure, a United Nations Trust Fund has been established for implementation of the electoral aspects of the peace process.  The Fund will assist political parties to organize and prepare for the electoral process, and covers costs associated with requirements such as transportation, office space, communication facilities and other essentials.  Over $10 million has already been donated to the Fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rehabilitation and recovery of Mozambique after more than a decade and a half of protracted civil war will be a daunting challenge.  More than a million and a half Mozambicans have taken refuge in neighbouring countries, and between 4 and 5 million more remain displaced inside Mozambique in search of food and security. A consolidated humanitarian assistance programme has been developed for Mozambique to support emergency relief, repatriation, demobilization, the restoration of essential services and the country's balance of payments deficit.  The programme will require $559.6 million for the 12-month period from May 1993 through April 1994, of which $450 million has already been pledged and committed to specific activities.  During the recent donors meeting in Maputo, additional pledges amounting to some $70 million were announced.  In South Africa, 60 United Nations observers are now working in close collaboration with counterparts from the OAU, the Commonwealth Secretariat and the European Community to facilitate South Africa's transition to majority rule. United Nations observers have provided support to community peace projects, assisted local development initiatives, worked to ease political tensions and monitored police conduct at political marches and rallies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition to these efforts, I have myself undertaken several initiatives during the past year to try to curb the terrifying cycle of violence that has gripped South Africa. I have repeatedly urged all South African leaders and political parties to put an end to violence and to work together to reach agreement on interim arrangements for the establishment of a new political system.  In this connection, my special representatives and envoys have met with all of the major political parties to discuss the implementation of United Nations resolutions calling for the establishment of a united, non-racial and democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After many years of government opposition to the presence of international observers, these initiatives and activities mark a significant breakthrough for South Africa and for the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With respect to Angola, there is less reason for optimism. The collapse of the Bicesse Accords following the refusal of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to accept its defeat at the polls plunged Angola back into civil war.  The small United Nations force authorized under the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM II) mandate was wholly unsuited to intervene in the fierce resumption of hostilities that followed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The deteriorating political and military situation in Angola, the collapse of the joint monitoring and verification groups provided for under the Bicesse Accords, and the evacuation of most UNAVEM II sites have drastically reduced the observation and verification functions of the mission -- which formed the main part of its mandate.  The UNAVEM II, therefore, is now concentrating its efforts on liaison activities and on assisting the delivery of humanitarian relief to the civilian population.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The humanitarian situation in Angola remains very grave. Health services, market structures and food production efforts have largely collapsed.  It is now estimated that more than 2 million Angolans are suffering from hunger, drought and disease. Recent reports indicate that over 1,000 people a day are dying from malnutrition and other factors associated with the war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to address these grave problems, the United Nations has launched a $226 million consolidated inter- agency appeal for Angola.  This and other assistance will continue to be supervised and coordinated by my Special Representative for Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None the less, providing humanitarian relief under present conditions remains a daunting challenge. Humanitarian assistance continues to be delivered to both government- and UNITA-controlled areas, albeit with great difficulty and often at significant risk to the United Nations personnel involved.  United Nations flights have been fired upon by UNITA forces, and aid relief workers have been attacked throughout the country.  Although the collapse of the Abidjan talks leaves little room for optimism, the United Nations will continue its efforts to provide humanitarian relief while working to achieve a cease-fire and a resumption of the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of the set-back suffered in Angola, it is especially heartening for me to be able to conclude this survey of United Nations activities with a genuine and remarkable success story from Africa.  Quick and exemplary international cooperation to deal with the devastating drought in southern Africa averted a widely predicted catastrophe.  Commentators had compared the southern African drought to the deadly drought that gripped Ethiopia and the Sudan in 1984-85, and it was predicted that hundreds of thousands of people would likely perish due to famine and disease.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ten countries in southern Africa were involved, and approximately 20 million people spread over 2 million square miles were affected.  Total food output throughout the region had dropped to less than half that of previous years, and 4 million tons of food aid was needed from donor countries.  Emergency non-food needs were estimated to approach $200 million.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Led by the countries of the region, coordinated by the United Nations system and matched by a quick donor response, disaster was averted.  The 10 Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries mobilized to battle the disaster with extraordinary speed.  The SADC early warning units had alerted the world to the looming famine at a very early stage, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP) jointly mounted multiple crop and food supply assessment missions confirming the enormity of the problem the region faced.  The newly established Department of Humanitarian Affairs then prepared the United Nations system's first-ever famine relief appeal, issued jointly by the United Nations and a regional body, SADC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Donors responded immediately with food aid pledges covering virtually all the assistance that was needed.  The seriousness and commitment demonstrated by SADC, as well as donor satisfaction with the procedures initiated by the United Nations to keep donors abreast of developments in all sectors, encouraged the fast donor response and facilitated this impressive mobilization of resources and effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the return of the rains to southern Africa, this remarkable effort in human cooperation has been fittingly rewarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is also heartening for me to refer to one of the major areas of concern to the United Nations, which is human development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations continues to give priority attention to human development goals in Africa, particularly as it relates to children.  In this regard, UNICEF provided assistance to the OAU for the convening of the International Conference on Assistance to African Children, in Dakar last November.  The Consensus of Dakar sets out important goals to be achieved in Africa by 1995 in furtherance of child survival, protection and development.  I can ssure you that the United Nations system will support the efforts of African countries to achieve those goals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In concluding this opening speech, I should like to invite you -- to invite us all -- to reflect and to demand more of ourselves.  I should like all of us here to undertake the most difficult task there is, but one which</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">every man and woman on this continent expects of us: to consider Africa's future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To consider the future of Africa is both to think in the long term and to think &quot;here and now&quot;.  It means being mindful of the broad economic forces and devoting one's attention to people's daily lives.  It means constructing a general political context for future action and finding practical means to embody present reality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To consider Africa's future is also to create new bonds at the national, regional and international levels. It is to mobilize energies and consciences on behalf of development.  It is to place one's confidence in a rich continent -- yes, a continent which is very rich in people, in ideas and in raw materials.  But it is also a continent in which intolerable inequalities prevail, and in which lavish expenditure exists side by side with unimaginable poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To think about Africa's future is lastly to find means, models and projects which can rekindle our confidence.  It is to believe in the capacity of Africans freely to invent their own history.  It is to restore pride in itself to a continent which is essential for mankind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For these intentions to be more than just pious hopes and become a plan of action, it is more necessary than ever before to reflect together and to allow our imaginations free rein, while at the same time placing them at the service of our common objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These objectives are centred about a single word -- the word &quot;development&quot;.  But make no mistake, this word, which seems so simple, denotes a process of infinite complexity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This process is complex because development is neither a model to be copied, nor a programme to be executed.  It is an ongoing response to world developments.  It is complex because development cannot be reduced to economic development alone.  It has a political, social, cultural and psychological dimension as well.  It is complex because development depends both on others and on oneself.  It is complex because development embraces a common outlook and diverse ways of approaching it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, it is complex because it is not an objective in and of itself, but is rather the transcendant expression of a number of other objectives.  Among those objectives which both circumscribe and promote development are the imperative of peace and the duty of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The imperative of peace is essential for the controlled management of development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When I read development projects, plans of action, medium-term adjustments, economic programmes, I am always struck by the fact that they all assume -- whether through naivete, excessive optimism, ignorance, lack of courage, I am not sure -- the existence of an idyllic state of peace. In these future-oriented analyses, war appears as nothing more than a random occurrence.  Unfortunately, when it comes to Africa, one must admit that aggression, border conflicts, tribal strife, ethnic confrontation and civil war, far from being a passing phase in our history, appear to be serious and persistent trends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like you, I know that Africa is not solely responsible for these situations of conflict.  Far from it.  The arbitrary carving up of land, frontiers inherited from the period of colonization, rivalries stirred up from outside and the pressure of foreign interests have, alas, become quasi-permanent features of the African political landscape. Over the past 50 years it is Africa which has experienced the greatest number of armed conflicts, in spite of the commendable efforts of the OAU to settle disputes between African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As Secretary-General of the United Nations, I have spoken, whenever I have had the opportunity, of the importance I attach to the role of regional organizations in the solution of conflicts. Indeed, I have had the opportunity to see how the OAU, together with the League of Arab States and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, played a leading role in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once again I invite the OAU to be completely faithful to the mission entrusted to it by its founding fathers -- peace.  Peace as an element in the democratization of international life; peace as the victory of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The democratic imperative is in fact one of the fundamental tasks that Africa must take on.  I see democracy as the missing link between peace and development -- because democracy safeguards peace, and because sound development is unimaginable without democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But this concept of democracy must continually be given a new form -- and this OAU Conference is an ideal setting for giving thought to this.  Yes, democracy is a concept that has to be constantly reinvented.  By that I mean -- and I want to tell you this in the clearest possible way -- that in exhorting you thus to promote democracy, I have no wish to urge you to be imitative in any way or to call on you to borrow political forms from elsewhere, or still less to try to please certain Westerners. On the contrary, It has to be said firmly that democracy belongs to no one.  It can and must be assimilated by all cultures.  It can take myriad forms and is, thus, all the better geared to the situation of peoples all around the world.  Democracy cannot be fashioned after the model provided by certain States; rather, it is a goal to be attained by all peoples. It is the manifestation of our common heritage.  It is an asset that must be shared by all.  Democracy also belongs to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this grand democratic scheme of things, a contribution is required of all citizens -- both women and men -- and of associations and public opinion.  But I believe that above all it is the noblest task that falls to States.  Yes, I believe in the State, in its capacity to transform structures and to safeguard freedoms.  I believe that both in Africa and elsewhere the State is a melting-pot for cultures, a favoured place for learning about civic responsibility.  And I am filled with the most profound concern when I see some States -- more frequently in Africa than elsewhere -- sink into failure, into decay and into disorder, until they are nothing more than an abstract backcloth for true anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Where attaining the democratic ideal is concerned -- and I am saying this to you here in earnest -- I expect a great deal of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The State, as I see it, is not merely a narrow circle of political leaders.  I would even say, without contradicting myself, that the State is first and foremost an administration. An administration that is sound, honest, dedicated, educated and concerned about public service and the public interest.  We know that Africa does not have any prerogative where corruption is concerned, and that corruption is the most evenly distributed evil in the world. In Africa, however, the administration often has to be</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">created, rebuilt or restored.  This is an urgent task: without an administration, there can be no true democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In my view, the State also serves the cause of fundamental freedoms.  We know today that freedom cannot be promoted against the will of the State, but must be built in cooperation with the State.  Africa has played an important role with regard to this change in thinking.  It is Africa that has gone the furthest, in various international forums, in examining the relationships between domestic law, human rights and the law of nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> None the less, we all know, international public opinion is often harsh with regard to human rights in Africa.  Does this mean that we are more barbarous than people elsewhere?  Do we have less respect for human nature?  Are our diplomats not as well trained as those of other countries in projecting a positive image of our countries abroad?  Or is the industrialized countries' aim to find an easy way of exonerating themselves of the grave injustices prevailing in their territories by focusing international public opinion on Africa?  Today these are questions that we cannot avoid asking ourselves and to which I, for my part, have a number of partial answers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One thing is certain in any event -- there can be no sustainable development without promotion of democracy and, consequently, without respect for human rights.  We are all aware that undemocratic practices and authoritarian policies sometimes accompany the measures taken early on by some countries when they embark on the development process. However, we also know that if, once they have achieved initial economic results, these States do not undertake democratic reform, the final outcome will be merely insubstantial growth, which is a source of greater inequalities and social disruption in the future.  I repeat, only democracy makes development meaningful.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, the question of Africa's development presents itself in terms that are both old and new.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are old, sadly, for reasons which we can only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">enumerate once again: the debt burden; the unfairness of the international economic system; Africa's trade and technological dependence; inadequate or non-existent infrastructure; and inadequate vocational and technical training, to mention a few.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the question has a new dimension as well, for the rest of the world's perception of Africa has changed.  And this is a source of great concern to me.  With the end of the cold war, the West has lived through a period of euphoria in the past few years, and Europe -- Africa's traditional advocate -- is tempted to turn inwards and redirect its development assistance and investment towards its new, eastern &quot;frontier&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of the new international economic order, the very concept of partnership is becoming a dim memory. Today, the industrialized countries are having a difficult time choosing between their business relations and their humanitarian impulses in their dealings with Africa. Concerted development is increasingly becoming an idea without substance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa must learn everything that this situation has to teach.  Far from giving up on the international community, Africa must show by its own actions that it is worthy of that community's confidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end, Africa must itself undertake a number of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">urgent tasks: first of all, Africa must strengthen its regional structures so that progress can be achieved throughout the continent.  How many economic, customs and administrative stumbling blocks, how many infrastructural and communications inadequacies could be overcome by more effective cooperation between African States.  In this area, regional and subregional economic organizations should, at last, play a role consistent with their charters.  Yet, paradoxically, there may actually be too many of these organizations.  In any event, there are too few that function in a satisfactory manner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Secondly, Africa must diversify its economy.  Today, consensus has been achieved on one point -- the whole world agrees that national stabilization policies are imperative. Yet this raises many questions.  Are there special steps that must be taken to promote such diversification?  Should diversification be promoted through intervention and, if so, how should this be done? Or, is it better simply to let countries straighten out their macroeconomic policies, leaving diversification to the operations of the market? How can feasibility studies be encouraged in this area, and how can they be financed?  Africa must find its own answers to all these questions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lastly, Africa must promote training.  The region has a sizeable population, which is an invaluable resource.  The people of Africa must be guaranteed food and health.  More than ever, I believe in the capacity of African men and women for work, action, initiative, imagination and creativity.  All the initiatives that I have witnessed or learned of fill me with confidence.  In towns, Africa must control urban growth and adapt technological progress to specific needs of the African people.  In the countryside, farmers must be given respect commensurate with the importance and dignity of their labour.  And here I should like to emphasize and commend the exemplary role played by rural women.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, it is common knowledge that such efforts on the part of Africa require a high level of support.  In saying this I am appealing not to the generosity but to the conscience of the industrialized countries.  I urge them to become aware of international linkages, to learn how the interests of our planet are interdependent and to acknowledge that Africa can be an element of peace and prosperity for the entire world if it at last receives that which is its due.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Obviously, this assumes the existence of a market that does not systematically favour the richest.  It also assumes a mandatory reduction of the debt weighing on Africa's shoulder and encumbering its capacities for self-financing. In addition, the industrialized States must provide project- specific financing, promote the training of a skilled labour force and encourage long-term projects.  The international community must invent new forms of cooperation, of assistance between States, of assistance between States and organizations and assistance between organizations.  In short, the entire cycle of cooperation must be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This, then, ladies and gentlemen, is the message, the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">cry that I would like to raise: No, Africa is not alone! No, Africa has not been abandoned!  The eyes of the world are still on Africa!</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As for myself, rest assured that from my current vantage point, I am devoting all my energy to mobilizing the international community and the United Nations on behalf of Africa so that they may encourage Africa's efforts, which I know to be considerable, and so that Africa, far from being a continent untouched by progress, may at last assume its rightful place as an integral part of mankind on the march.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">2334 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The following letter was sent by the Inter-Church Coalition on Africa to the World Bank on the issue of health along with endorsements by over 70 groups and organizations around the world. 7 July, 1993 Mr. Lewis Preston President, World Bank 1818 H Street N.W. Washington, D.C. U.S.A. 20433</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Preston:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are writing to you on the occasion of the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">release of World Development Report 1993: Investing in Health. Our concern for the issue of health arises out of a moral and practical concern for both the physical and spiritual well-being of persons. Implicit in our concern is a recognition of the basic dignity and equality of all persons. This leads us to an interest not only in the health of individuals, but also the health of the collective body of communities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the health and livelihood of citizens around the world are very closely linked to the policies which the World Bank promotes, we appreciate that the World Bank has chosen to focus on this important issue.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that access to health care is a basic human right. It marks the dignity of the human person. Health care must therefore be made available to all, regardless of race, class, ethnic origin or ability to pay.  Health care cannot be efficiently allocated by market forces or promoted in a context of growing poverty and environmental degradation. Good health and health care policies can only emerge in an environment where health is accorded primacy, along with education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that the vision of health care outlined in the World Development Report 1993 falls far short of the most basic requirements for health. It promotes instead a two-tiered system of health care which is distorted by an undue emphasis on privatization. In essence, the report urges poorer countries to cede most health care to the private sector, leaving governments to provide a minimal package of primary health care for the poor and to try to regulate the private sector. What it ignores is the devastating impact of the debt crisis and the implementation of structural adjustment programmes on health care in developing countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In light of this we strongly urge the World Bank to undertake a critical re-examination of its health strategy and of the links between health and the broader issues of poverty, economic and political reform, and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">international indebtedness. In particular we recommend: 1) That the World Bank promote health care policies which affirm the principles of universality and equal access both within and between countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Development Report 1993 promotes a system of health care for developing countries which encourages private sector involvement and user fees for health services beyond a minimum guaranteed package. This basic package, however, consists of little more than public education, immunization programmes, and only very basic coverage. Only those who can afford it will have access to even the most basic operations. In a context of high unemployment, soaring prices and growing poverty this strategy only increases inequities in access to health services and effectively closes off access to adequate health care for the poor. The transformation of health care into a privatized, user- pay system thus constitutes another assault on both the physical welfare and the basic human dignity of the poor. The argument that user fees would only be charged to those who can afford it have little meaning in a context where over 75% of the population lives below the poverty line as is the case in some African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As an alternative to this approach we favour a community- based, comprehensive vision of health care where people are given the power and tools to reduce the problems of ill-health that are intimately related to the economic and social patterns of their society. Comprehensive health care must be part of an overall development strategy to combat poverty and promote self- reliance. The provision of adequate health care depends upon a commitment of the state's resources. This vision can be realized only if the governments, health services and aid donors all support this process of change.  2) That the World Bank officially end its support for orthodox structural adjustment programmes for Sub- Saharan Africa, and that the World Bank take a leadership role in debt reduction by, among other things, calling for a cancellation of multi-lateral debt to low-income countries and highly indebted middle income countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposals contained in the 1993 World Development Report do not address the single greatest factor contributing to the health care crisis in the South. Many countries have been compelled to adopt structural adjustment programmes, which have had a devastating impact on the health and livelihood of most of their citizens. We regard this consequence of the debt crisis to be the largest single threat to health currently facing the global community.  Structural adjustment undermines the ability of states to allocate resources towards either health care or self-reliant development, and instead turns these resources towards the export sector and debt servicing. How can poor countries possibly give either resources or attention to health care when significant amounts of their scarce capital continue to be siphoned off by Northern banks, G-7 governments, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the 1980s, the World Bank took on the role of debt custodian, in effect bailing out commercial banks, Northern governments, the IMF and itself by using funds earmarked for development assistance for debt repayments. The servicing of the growing debts owed to the World Bank and the IMF are another problem they have directly contributed to the dismantling of health care systems.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the world's largest development institution, the World Bank has enormous power over the lives of people around the world, many of whom succumb daily to the downward spiral of poverty and declining health. We believe that many of the conclusions of your report on health care will only exacerbate this crisis. We believe that the recommendations contained in this letter will help to alleviate their plight. We urge you to reconsider your approach in light of these comments. Yours sincerely, Charlotte Maxwell Co-Chair, Board Inter-Church Coalition on Africa Clarke Raymond Acting General Secretary Canadian Council of Churches</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I have worked for many years in Africa as a nurse and mid-wife where I had to cope with a crumbling health care system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now the World Bank has offered up its own prescription for the health crisis in the Third World. It correctly draws attention to some of the underlying</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">causes: concentration of resources on curative, urban- based services; mismanagement and inefficiency of the public health sector; bureaucratic constraints; and extensive poverty.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank offers some solutions such as the need to promote rural-based primary health care. However, it ignores the role it has played in contributing to the general decline in health and health care in countries where its economic policies have been adopted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These policies have actually increased poverty in most African countries over the past decade. Fee-for- service, privatization, massive layoffs, cutbacks of social services have led to deepening malnutrition, hospital closures and worsening poverty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Bank's proposals for improving health in the Third World obscure the basic fact that its primary goal is to ensure an orderly flow of debt repayments to banks and Western governments. The World Bank itself has amassed profits totaling over $13 billion (US) over the past decade through debt payments extracted from Third World countries. The interests of the poor in good health, clean water, education and employment are peripheral to the underlying design of World Bank programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Zimbabwe, for example, showed a remarkable improvement in health care during the 1980s. In 1990 the country adopted one of the World Bank's so-called structural adjustment programmes which recommended, among other things, the introduction of health care user fees. Since then, the number of women dying in childbirth in the Harare, the capital city has doubled because mothers could not afford the fees imposed for maternity services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even World Bank officials are gradually admitting that their economic policies have broadly failed in economic terms. They have also failed the people whom they are supposed to serve. Yet, now the World Bank threatens to compound past mistakes by incorporating health and health care for the Third World into the market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is time to identify clearly the motives and agenda of the world's largest development agency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank must be called to account for its disturbing legacy of bad loans to corrupt leaders, failed projects and flawed development policies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What African countries need now is a commitment from our governments and from development agencies like the World Bank to support their efforts to develop and implement their own comprehensive health care programmes where people not markets take priority. This commentary piece aired on the Canada's National Radio (C.B.C.) on Friday July 9, 1993.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">STATEMENT ON SOMALIA July 14, 1993 -- First, let me express my profound sorrow for the tragic deaths of four of your colleagues on 12 July in Mogadishu. As you know, they were not killed in cross-fire. They were deliberately targeted for murder in the performance of their duties. And that is the measure of the chaos that has descended upon Mogadishu. I deliberately say Mogadishu and not Somalia because it is easy to lose sight of the fact that the cast majority of the Somali people outside the capital city are working with the United Nations to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, disarmament and political reconciliation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However bad the situation in Mogadishu now seems, let us not forget that a few short months ago, things were infinitely worse. There was a raging civil war, the likes of which we have very rarely seen in modern times and where, for the first time, humanitarian relief shipments were blocked and looted. In addition, those providing humanitarian relief actually became the targets of gangs and militias roaming the country and killing fellow Somalis.  In this chaos, a number of international relief workers such as Dr.  Pumpalova, Mr. Devereaux and Mr. Luftinberger were murdered. 350,000 Somalis died in 1992 in chaos perpetrated by such gangs in 1992, and at the height of the crisis 3,000 Somalis were dying every day of starvation.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is in this context that the Security Council authorized in December 1992 the first ever Chapter VII operation for humanitarian purposes. The goals of this</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">action were very clear: to establish a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian relief and at the same time move forward the process of political reconciliation and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With this action by the Security Council, there was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immediate success: relief began to flow, death rates from starvation dropped dramatically, and famine now has virtually disappeared. The United Nations also brought together twice in Addis Ababa the various political factions who had been locked in violent disputes for two years and had refused to talk to each other. We should not forget that it was the Somalis themselves at those meetings who asked us to ensure a general disarmament of the country because they knew that this was an essential condition both for political reconciliation and reconstruction of their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Admittedly, we have had setbacks but let us not forget that it is only one of the factions which is behind the current violence in Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I think there is universal agreement that we simply cannot allow Somalia to slide back to the anarchy of the recent past. It is essential that we root out the criminal elements who, just in the past few weeks, have killed some 35 peace keepers, four journalists as well as Somali nationals working for international organizations. And this of course, in addition to the death and destruction, that these elements have once again wrought upon their own people in South Mogadishu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We hope that this is only a parenthesis in the overall thrust of the operation and that this particular phase of instability will be concluded rapidly. We have no alternative but to make sure that Mogadishu is rid of all weaponry. As long as there is not full disarmament, even a cessation of hostilities could not provide the lasting confidence that the Somali people need to continue with the rebuilding of their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In saying all this I am not trying to minimize the problem that we face. All I am saying is that we must look at the current violence in Mogadishu in the context of our overall objective of restoring peace and bringing the country together once again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So let me repeat, I do not want to minimize the problems that we face.  You all know that there is some disagreement among certain countries participating in UNOSOM II about the best way to achieve our goals. I have in mind the question of command and control. But such disagreements are to be expected when you consider that we have peace-keepers from the most diverse group of nations, some participating for the very first time in peacekeeping operations. We are trying to mold them into one unified force, but teething problems are to be expected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These disagreements are being discussed quite openly at the highest level and I am confident that we can sort them out. I would also like to deny reports that the Italian contingent is pulling out of Somalia. To the contrary, strong support for the United Nations operation in Somalia has been expressly by the Italian cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Let me also state that, contrary to reports, we are not opposed to negotiations with the factions involved. We are dealing with all factions, and have not cut off contact even with Aideed's group. However, these must be conducted through the channels set up by the Security Council and the Secretary-General. We must all be clear that there is one command under the Secretary-General, his Special Representative, Admiral Howe and the Force Commander, General Bir.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">May 17, 1993 Before I begin, I would like to respond to Abdul Mohammed's expression of thanks for the freedom to organize this event without government interference or restrictions. In view of our history of authoritarian rule, I well understand that this newfound freedom is appreciated, but I want to take this opportunity to say that this freedom is not a privilege, but a right, an I look forward to the day when we can take such fundamental rights for granted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The making of a constitution is an historic event of great significance for any country, but for the pursuit of democratic ideals and practice worldwide.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are therefore privileged to welcome so many of you who have come from different parts of the world to share your experience, your views, your knowledge with us, in this symposium. We are confident that your contributions will be valuable, and I can assure you that we will use them, that we will learn from you.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The making of a constitution is a complex process, encapsulating the basic principles and values of democracy, drawing on experience and lessons learnt elsewhere while establishing the frame work and mechanisms most appropriate for a given country. Ethiopia is a vast and complex land, a mosaic of many peoples, languages, cultures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are trying to draft a constitution which is relevant to all of our people, which addresses the fundamental issues in our society, the majority of whom are peasant farmers, pastoralists, who have in the past had little of no access to the structures of power which determined their fate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This constitution is being drafted also in the context of rapid societal change. The past two years have been a time of transition for Ethiopia, with far- reaching effects for all our people.. We have seen the overthrow of the Derg regime, the establishment of the Transitional Government, coming from years of bitter struggle and enormous pain and sacrifice on the part of millions of ordinary men and women in Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During these two years we have been able to move forward and take steps within a process which will guarantee democracy and lasting peace for this long- suffering land of ours. This process has been instrumental in establishing numerous institutions which characterize the democratic nature of a state, such as an independent judicial system, an impartial police force, local democracy within decentralized regional administrations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The people of Ethiopia have achieved democratic rights, the right to express themselves freely without fear, the right to organize, to demonstrate. A new democratic culture has begun to flower in our country.  Through effecting democratic rights, our people are also learning to confront and overcome considerable hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This government is prepared to advance and advocate the cardinal principle of the supremacy of the constitution. This means that the charter &quot;though we still uphold its ruling principles&quot; and legislative measures enabled under the Charter, are all subordinate to the new constitution. In consequence, all those with misgivings about the charter are now free to make their case in the debates and deliberations over the new constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new constitution can therefore serve as fresh ground for settling past differences and for the creation of a deeper convergence and concord in the future. We hope that everyone, especially those dissatisfied or frustrated, will now accept the challenge.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Herein lies the importance of this symposium, not in outlining the details of what our constitution is to be, but in giving us an opportunity to tap the rich experience of other countries. This symposium can help us in identifying the fine points and key issues encountered in similar processes elsewhere, in anticipating and overcoming potential pitfalls and problems. It is then up to us to draw what we need from this and apply it to our own particular conditions and situations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I do not believe this is the right time and place for me to present my views on the detail of what our new constitutions should include.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, I believe it is appropriate for me to identify the main objectives and issues which I believe our constitution should address.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First and foremost, our constitution must be a constitution of the people. They must believe in it, they must call it their own. It must be conceptually accessible to and easily understood by all of our people, using clear, plain language without mystification or confusion. It must be directly relevant and applicable to their daily lives, not a remote instrument of a remote government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We must ask ourselves what will this constitution mean for the people?  To whom is it addressed? How will it be seen by grassroots communities in every corner of Ethiopia?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However perfectly crafted, however noble its ideals, a constitution which is not accessible to all, which does not belong to all, will at the end of the day be simply a piece of paper in the hand of an elite. Its fate will echo that of other African countries where short-lived efforts at democratization of society were never achieved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When we say our constitution must be a constitution of the people, we mean first of all the Ethiopian people, men and women, throughout every town and village, must be actively involved from the beginning of the drafting process right through to the final ratification. It is through their active participation in all stages of the democratization process that the ordinary people of Ethiopia will make this process, this constitution, their own, theirs to use, theirs to defend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This genuine participation of the people demands the kind of democracy which can only be accomplished when political power is not centralized in the hands of the few, when it is devolved down through every region, every town district, village, every household, in a way that genuinely empowers local communities to administer their own affairs, to determine the course of their own lives and futures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We want to democratize, to empower, every sector and level of our society. Democracy cannot be partial, it must be for all, or it is not democracy. Power must be exercised from the bottom up, at every level, it must be a tool in the hands of the people, to safeguard their democracy and work for development. Our constitution must enable us to establish such democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> You know, there are those, and they are not few, who say that democracy and development are incompatible, who claim that poor countries like Ethiopia cannot afford the luxury of democracy. They also say that democracy fosters instability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In any discussion on the compatibility of democracy and development, it is important to focus on what kind of democracy we need and its relation to social and economic development. If and when a constitution represents a democracy within which there is a genuine empowerment of the people, the people will use this constitution, will use their empowerment to engage in socioeconomic development, to improve their lives, to work in every way for their own future and that of their community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this way, democracy becomes an integral and indispensable instrument of, rather than a hindrance to development. Not only is democracy fully compatible with development, it is indispensable for development. A democracy which is deeply rooted among the people, which has a broad base throughout every village, every sector of the population, which is directed, protected, by a constitution designed not to create endless constitution crisis, but to promote stability, we believe such a democracy cannot foster instability. This is the type of democracy which we need, which we want to establish. Such a democracy is both an instrument of socio-economic development and lasting peace and stability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only such a broad based democratic system can foster stability, peace, and justice in our country, can create the climate and conditions essential for stable developments and economic prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As all of you know, Ethiopia as an entity encompasses many different nations and nationalities, an enormous variety of beliefs, culture, traditions. This reality has been a dominant feature in the political life of our country, it has been a trigger for bitter warfare.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It represents at one and the same time a multifaceted mosaic of rich diversity and cultural wealth for our country, and a potential source of instability and conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There are those who, on the basis of experience and events in other countries as well as in our own, conclude that the very existence of so many different entities in Ethiopia represents a great weakness, and is inherently and inevitably disastrous.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, we choose to see this aspect of Ethiopia, this diversity, as a source of great political and cultural strength. Throughout this transition period, we have been able to prove that what many see as a time bomb can be turned into an asset. We believe we have shown that in Ethiopia it is possible to change the potentially negative aspects of national diversity, to solve the problems in a positive and constructive way, and to transform this diversity into a source of strength rather than weakness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Accomplishing this successfully depends on certain</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">key factors:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Diversity must not be wished away, camouflaged, suppressed. It must be embraced as it is, it must be allowed free expression. It must be manifested in the nature, in the mechanisms of democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. It must be possible for people to assert their own national and cultural identity, to respect and support each other's diversity, within the context of their common Ethiopian identity. We believe there is no incompatibility, no inherent conflict, in being at the same time an Amhara and an Ethiopian, an Oromo and an Ethiopian, a Tigrayan and an Ethiopian, a Guarage and an Ethiopian, and so on. All are distinct and diverse, while at the same time interwoven into the fabric of the entity we call Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. Our constitution must embrace this diversity, while at the same time continuously promoting unity. It must promote the concept of unity based on diversity and equality. While encompassing and promoting the universal values and concepts of justice, human rights, freedom of expression and so on, for which our people have fought, it must also reflect and promote the particular values and characteristics of Ethiopian society, the tolerance, the solidarity, the perseverance, the sense of community, which unite the diverse entities within Ethiopia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This new constitution will determine the future political direction an life of our country, Ethiopia. It must therefore be both universal and fully Ethiopian in its nature. I do not anticipate any argument on this point.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, we also recognize that while the establishment of democracy may be a new phenomenon for Ethiopia, this is not true of many parts of the world. While the institutions and practices of democracy are new for Ethiopia, our people have struggled and paid a bitter price for the values and principles of democracy, for justice and equality and peace. These values and aspirations are universal, the achievements of those who fought for them, who have worked to establish democracy here and elsewhere, are shared by and belong to all of humanity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So we have no need to reinvent the wheel here in Ethiopia. We are privileged in being able to draw on the vast treasure house of experience from all over the world in our quest for a democratic system. We can see this knowledge and experience within the context of our particular experience, needs, conditions, and thereby create a truly Ethiopian constitution for the Ethiopian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, in short, our constitution must be both universal and Ethiopian in its nature. It must be relevant to the lives of our people. It must establish a framework which enables them to take power into their own hands, to play a decisive role in the affairs of their country. It must promote stability and progress as a prerequisite for genuine, sustainable, socioeconomic development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We stand now at a historical turning point in Ethiopian history, ushering in a new era of peace and stability for our people. Despite all the problems, the divisions, and bitter conflicts in the past, we have much to be proud of, enormous cause for optimism. We have never bowed our heads to oppression, never allowed it to break us.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our people have emerged from a dark period in our history, and have displayed a maturity, a wisdom, a civility, a spirit of reconciliation, in tackling both the divisions in our society which have torn us apart and caused so much suffering in the past, and the immense challenges of reconstruction and democratization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The present peace and stability in our country, which enables us to embark on this process, has been brought about through the victory won by our people at enormous cost. This is their moment in history, it is for the people to seize this moment and determine the shape of their future, their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This they will do in creating their own constitution which is Ethiopian in essence, which promotes unity, stability, progress, development, which can consolidate and build on the democratic rights for which they have fought so long and so hard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And so we look forward to the debates, discussions, the sharing of experience and ideas which your participation in this symposium during the week will bring, and you can be confident that you will be making a valuable contribution to this most important process in our country's history. Thank you.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Stop, stop causing suffering to the wounded people.&quot; That is the urgent appeal which we address today, to the Zairian political class as a whole and to those who hold power in particular.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In effect, the country has been at a standstill for ten months.  The state is no longer governed and its democratic institutions are paralyzed.  Moreover, for the last three months, by reason of partisan interests, all the efforts deployed to bring about a dialogue among the different parties have been in vain.  Those efforts have either been diverted from their objectives or purely and simply nullified.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But a solution is all the more urgent because the people live in complete insecurity, aggravated by the fact that acts have been taken either to deny the military their salaries and thereby incite them to revolution, looting, or extortion, or to pay them only to put them at odds with a starving people.  Not to mention other sources of tension such as tribal conflict and violence, massacres, and forced movements of populations organized for political ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The social situation is catastrophic and our economy collapsed.  Civil servants are hoping against hope for a salary which cannot satisfy their essential needs.  Zairian diplomats abroad have not been paid for fifteen months and live in a state of penury unbecoming to the Zairian nation.  The mechanisms of the banking system have come undone and no longer function.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps by the application of the rules of good governmental management established by the National Conference, with a minimum of good faith reinforced with the sense of the common good, and with concern for the greater interest of the nation and a spirit of dialogue, we would have surmounted this crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in the face of this crisis, the political authorities contented themselves instead with the terrorism of the state and the organization of a black market which serves nothing other than the interest of a financial oligarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As concerns the political leaders, they are doing nothing.  They seem to be at the end of inspiration and political strategies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Everyone is inclined to believe that a large number of political actors are in favor of seeing this confused situation continue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> --For some, because it is to their advantage to acquire dishonest wealth, a regular functioning and rigorous management of public finance would not be in their interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- For others, because they are afraid to take up the management of the state, preferring instead a conflictual situation which would bring them better chances at the next elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- And for still others, because they are uneasy at the prospect of the implementation of the decisions and institutional order of the National Conference, or to put it otherwise, the prospect of the coming of democracy and of a state of laws and rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We denounce all these selfish and irresponsible attitudes, because they distract the people, holding them hostage and preventing them from realizing their true freedom.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The consequence of this situation is the indifference of the powers-that-be to the misery of the people.  The state of laws and rights has in effect been murdered.  The national consensus is broken.  The relationship between the authorities and the people, which forms the basis for any democratic order, is gravely damaged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authority of the state no longer has dignified objectives.  It has thus become purposeless.  It has stopped being human.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even so a solution would be possible, if there were a minimum of good faith and loyalty, of honesty and spirit of dialogue is this dialogue, recognized by all to be well-founded and of overriding necessity.  But it has been blocked for six weeks for no good reason, to the great unhappiness of the Zairian people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What has happened, therefore, to cause this dialogue not to be pursued?  What prevents the much- awaited gestures of good faith from being met?  What is it, objectively speaking, that could justify the closing of the People's Palace, official seat of the High Council of the Republic, head institution of transition and recognized as such by all the parties?  What, in this period of transition and after the establishment of its institutional order by the National Conference, could justify the continued confiscation of the official media and the denial of access to them by certain sons and daughters of Zaire?  What is it that legitimatize, in the eyes of the regime that calls itself respectful of human rights, the detention of some citizens for reasons of opinion?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, are we not convinced that this crisis is absurd and artificially created, without regard to the dishonor which it brings to our country?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That is why we say to the political class that it is imperative that it bring itself to understand that in a state based on the rule of law (as was the will of the National Conference), power does not come from the barrel of a gun or from the street and must be held in the hands of legitimate institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We recall for the political class as well that democratic authority is not exercised by challenging a legitimate institution, and even less by defying the people by whose authority it is held, but by the happiness of the people and in harmony with them.  The challenge of authority is that of the elevation and complete development of the people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, we address a moving appeal to all members of the political class that they, without delay and once and for all, decide to resume the blocked dialogue, with the will this time to use it to its end and to respect its conclusions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO THE CHIEF OF STATE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We appeal to his sense of patriotism and implore in the name of heaven, for the love of our people, and in virtue of his high function of symbol and guarantor of the nation conferred upon him by the National Conference, to squarely take up his responsibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To this end, we invite him to eliminate, as far as it concerns him, all the reasons which make this crisis persist, to neglect nothing which could strengthen the confidence and the impartiality pertaining to his function as symbol and guarantor of the nation, and to be forever attentive to the legitimate aspirations of the people -- and of all the people -- for change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TO THE ZAIRIAN PEOPLE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We invite them to be aware of the fact that security, harmony and peace will not be with them if they oppose it with determination and fierceness, by developing love and solidarity amongst themselves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is because our nation cannot be built other than by harmony, peace and solidarity and without hate, selfishness and divisiveness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also we ask of them to continue to support firmly the legitimate institutions of the Republic in their efforts toward restoration of peace and harmony, without which there can be neither democratic change nor development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> God bless Zaire and give her peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We deplore the continuing crisis in Zaire and hold President Mobutu responsible for a situation which puts at risk the lives and welfare of millions of his countrymen, and the stability of an entire region. Assistant Secretary (George) Moose made our views clear to an envoy from President Mobutu of Zaire, Mr. Ngbanda Nzambo-ko-Atumba, during meetings on July 19 and 21.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">The purpose of the visit was to deliver Mobutu's response to a letter from Secretary (Warren) Christopher, and to hear our reaction. In his response, President Mobutu blamed the opposition and the High Council of the Republic for the continuing stalemate in Zaire and the resulting human suffering, including severe unrest in Shava and Kivu provinces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Assistant Secretary Moose informed Mr. Ngbanda that the United States finds this response to the Secretary's letter totally inadequate. He stressed that U.S. policy toward Zaire has not changed and that it remains clear to us that the only solution to Zaire's crisis is a transition government accepted by all major parties in accordance with the rules laid down by the National Conference. The primary objective of the transition must be agreement on a constitution followed by free and fair elections on terms acceptable to all major parties. It is also abundantly clear to objective observers that President Mobutu bears responsibility for the continuing political impasse, economic deterioration, and human suffering. We call on him once again to allow the transition to proceed or bear full responsibility for the consequences.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In November 1992, Americans Dan and Steve Buettner and Dr. Chip Thomas, along with Nigerian Mobolaji Oduyoye set off across Africa, to bike 11,000 miles on the continent of Africa. While attempting to set a world record, the expedition is conducting scientific research for NASA and is providing the backdrop for a youth education program reaching 50,000 classrooms worldwide.  The team has reached Zimbabwe on its way to South Africa. The following is an excerpt from the journal of the team leader on their experience in Zaire. ON THE ROAD IN ZAIRE From HABARI, the official journal of the AfricaTrek Expedition by Dan Buettner, expedition leader</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> True adventure began in Zaire, the central African country (as big as the United States east of the Mississippi) where Joseph Conrad set &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot; Zaire is covered with mountains, huge volcanoes, abundant wildlife and endless rain forests which shelter the Pygmies. It also has one of the most corrupt governments on earth, massive food shortages, potholed roads that could swallow a semi-truck and an over-armed, underpaid army famous for drinking hard liquor and confiscating tourists' possessions.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We shared the first two hundred miles of roads with merchants who travel up to 400 miles every week on one speed bicycles, buying kerosene, batteries and soap in Central African Republic to sell in their home villages. The road, just parallel tracks separated by a patch of vegetation, took us through bamboo forest -- lit sublimely by pencils of sunlight that shone through the branches -- across numerous bridgeless rivers and through dozens of tiny villages where life proceeds exactly as it has for centuries.  Zaire's economy is so bad that most people have reverted to subsistence farming, or a hunting and gathering existence. It took us three days to travel the first 200 miles in Zaire -- considerably slower that our 100-mile a day goal but faster than a party that took seven days by Land Rovers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We fell into a routine during the 18 days it took us to cross Zaire.  We woke to a breakfast of cold rice,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">packed our bags and started pedaling by 8:00 a.m. Though we took an hour break around noon, we rarely found lunch -- mostly we ate bananas, which people sold out of their huts -- 70 per cyclist per day. Every other day or so, we'd find a market and buy rice and beans. At night we stopped in mud huts and asked for permission to pitch our tent. To find water, we were led to a river or through the forest to a cloudy puddle known as &quot;a source.&quot; After we purified the water with our Penta Pure filters, we'd wash, boil rice and beans, talk to our</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">hosts and retire by 8:00 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Zairian adventure culminated the last night in the country when eight heavily armed paratroopers stopped us near the Ruwenzori Mountains.  They wore jaunty red berets, camouflage uniforms, yellow thongs and AK-47 machine guns slung over their shoulders. They warned us we were in a war zone and if we proceeded, we ran the risk of being attacked by Zairian rebels. I knew that the bridge these soldiers were guarding was obviously a rebel target and staying there for the night was not a safe option either. &quot;What do you recommend?&quot; I asked the commanding officer. &quot;It's your choice,&quot; he said.  Then waving his hand toward an arsenal that included grenades, a rocket launcher and a 50 mm anti- aircraft gun, said, &quot;But at least here you have protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other circumstances, that campsite might have been the most beautiful in all of Africa. A full moon had risen over the bluish peaks of the Ruwenzori Mountains, illuminating the misty, jungle-lined river and the yawning gray blobs which were the hippopotami swimming down below. We pitched our tents between the paratrooper's grass-hut barracks and settled in for an uneasy night's sleep.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Morning arrived without incident. A cacophony of birds clucking and whining along with chattering monkeys filled the humid jungle air. We ate breakfast with the soldiers, took Polaroids of them and bid them a happy farewell. I felt kind of silly for having been so afraid the previous night.  But before I pedaled a quarter mile away from the bridge, the birds fell abruptly silent with the loud crackle of machine gun fire. I didn't go back to investigate. That afternoon we crossed the border into Uganda.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">NEWSWATCH, July 19, 1993 Frank Ockiya, A Port Harcourt-based oil industry worker, was confused. In less than 12 hours he had two conflicting reports on the position of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) in the current political crisis. The NTA and FRCN network reported the Congress as cautioning workers not to protest the cancellation of the June 12 elections, the CHAMPION and PUNCH newspapers the following day reported the Congress as giving a 48 hour ultimatum to the federal government to release the results or face a general strike.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was still trying to make sane sense out of this when NTA again came up with a story that Pascal Bafyau, NLC president had denied giving the federal government an ultimatum. Speaking during a visit to the presidential villa to present the resolution of the Central Working Committee of the Congress on the</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">political impasse, Bafyau said: &quot;I don't know where they (newspapers) got their story.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days later, according to the PUNCH , the NLC leader called for the release of the June election results. The paper quoted him as saying that the NLC position was that the president should go ahead and declare the remaining results and this was made known to the president during the Aso Rock visit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NLC/Bafyau affair is typical of the confusion in the news media in the wake of the current political crisis. People don't know who or what to believe because of conflicting reports. Okunade Sijuwade, the Ooni of Ife at the end of a meeting of traditional rulers with the president the other week said they were satisfied with the government's new political agenda. NTA showed him on screen saying, &quot;we have to agree at a point because he was talking sense.&quot; That night, the Ooni, the CONCORD claimed, denied the story ion a telephone</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">interview with it. But the DAILY TIMES headline was: &quot;We're satisfied with new political agenda--Ooni&quot; and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CONCORD: &quot;I didn't agree with IBB... Ooni.&quot; Most readers did not know what to take, the traditional ruler's words on television or his denial in CONCORD.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A few days later, Sijuwade issued a full statement on his position on the outcome of the Abuja meeting. The statement signed by Funmilola Olorunnisola, his press secretary and reported by the GUARDIAN quoted the Ooni as saying that his position was misconstrued by the generality of the people because he was quoted out of context by a section of the media to satisfy the wishes of the government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> John Odigie-Oyegun who on television implied the 30 state governors accepted the federal government position on the elections had to address another press conference in Benin to &quot;clarify&quot; his position. The governor's case was rather dramatic. Odigie-Oyegun said on NTA they agreed to commit themselves to the emergence of a viable and permanent democratic system. This was also what CHAMPION reported. But the PUNCH and the CONCORD reported that the governors rejected the new agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tanko Abdullah, a Lagos trader said last week he was &quot;not sure of what was happening in the country any more. The confusion is too much.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is not alone in this. The newspapers have taken implacable stands and report all developments to suit themselves. The NATIONAL CONCORD owned by Moshood Abiola, refers to his as &quot;president elect&quot; although he was not so declared by the then National Electoral Commission, NEC, while President Ibrahim Babangida is the &quot;outgoing president.&quot; The PUNCH and VANGUARD refer to him so too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE NEWS reported that Abubakar Umar a colonel, was one of the moving forces behind the so-called hidden agenda. But the NATIONAL CONCORD was the first to publish Umar's letter resigning from the military in protest against the cancellation of the election result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The news media themselves have also become victims of the confusion.  Nendo Gawa, editor of the NIGERIAN TIDE, the Rivers State government -owned newspaper, was reportedly sent on compulsory leave for allegedly publishing the verdict of a Benin court ordering the National Electoral Commission to release the results of the June 12 presidential elections. Last week in Port Harcourt, the management of the paper denied ever sending the editor on forced leave. Dan Obinna, secretary/legal adviser of the company told NEWSWATCH the editor is on his &quot;normal annual leave.&quot; Gawa himself confirmed.  &quot;I am on my annual leave and would resume at the end of the period.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PUNCH first reported THE NEWS was proscribed. Femi Falana, the magazine's lawyer came out to deny the alleged proscription in the GUARDIAN although he admitted the police distributed an undated proscription order.  The magazine was still on sale at the news-stand in Lagos but another report said the police in Minna had arrested three vendors for selling it. Last week Bayo Onanuga editor-in-chief of THE NEWS announced the suspension of the publication of the magazine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> THE HERALD in the June 26 edition published an imaginary letter from the president's daughter Halimat to her father on the current political impasse. A few days later the paper apologized over what was a mere fiction.  Despite the apology, Abdul Razaki El Alawa, editor and two other management staff of the paper were arrested by security agents. THE HERALD is owned by Kwara State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the STANDARD, owned by Plateau State government, an editorial was carried on the political crisis only to be retracted a few days later. Six editors of the paper resigned in protest. They alleged the counter editorial was forced on them. The same allegation was made by Yakubu Andulazeez editor of the NEW NIGERIAN who resigned over the paper's editorial of June 16 titled &quot;OUR NATION, OUR DESTINY.&quot; He alleged the editorial was faxed from Abuja. His company replied that his resignation was a &quot;politically orchestrated blackmail&quot; against it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The confusion is not even helped by the principal actors in the crisis. The CONCORD claimed the federal government had apologized to Abiola through Uche Chukwumerije, information secretary on a BBC interview.  Chukwumerije denied it promptly. Last week, Babangida himself said he owed nobody any apology over his stewardship because his belief in the greatness of the country was solid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the number of people killed during the riot last wee, in Lagos, Chukwumerije in a statement said nobody died. But other news media reported that more than 50 people were killed. As Ockiya put it, few readers now know what to make of media reports. &quot;NTA tells you one thing and CONCORD tells you another.&quot; Reprinted from NEWSWATCH, July 19, 1993</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Forget about Nelson Mandela, Mangosuthu Buthelezi and F.W. de Klerk.  It's time to meet South Africa's most successful grassroots peace-maker. He is, incidentally a foreigner -- Ghanaian-born Moses Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the eight months that he headed the Commonwealth Observer Mission (CoM) in Durban, the genial 45-year old Anafu succeeded where local peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">mediators had tried and failed: brokering peace between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the strife-torn district of kwaNdwalane, near Port Shepstone, both the ANC and the Local Dispute Resolution Committee made overtures to chief Aaron Ndwalane. Facing murder charges, and with the reputation of being a &quot;warlord&quot;, Ndwalane spurned their olive branch.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet Anafu had success -- not only in kwaNdwalane, but also in the districts of kwaMavundla, Ezingolweni, Ndwedwe and Umbumbulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Explaining the reason behind his success Anafu</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">said: &quot;I come from a chiefly family (his father was a chief) so I was quite familiar with the protocol. When I arrived here, I noticed that the chiefs were conspicuously absent from the peace process -- and you could not bring peace to rural Natal without their whole-hearted involvement. We therefore put chiefs at the heart of the whole process&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After urging Ndwalane to adopt a neutral stance, Anafu gave him the role of peacemaker in the community and helped him to restore his authority over his subjects. Ndwalane called peace meetings between the ANC and IFP earning the respect of both sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This was a far cry from the days when the chief, under fierce attack from ANC-supporting youth was forced to flee his territory.  Ndwalane returned later with his warriors and ruled with an iron fist, driving ANC youth away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the height of the violence in the 1980s, about 50 people were dying each month in his area. Violence has now declined sharply, with fedw deaths recorded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Elaborating on his methods, Anafu said: &quot;I told the chiefs what they already knew. that not matter what misgivings, anxieties and fears they may have ofg the future, as fathers of the community they need to take the lead -- and not only to support the peace process. When two of their sons fight, they need to mediate -- not take sides.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He has also tried to allay the fears of chiefs, citing the case of pre-independence Ghana, where the chiefs earned the ire of Nkrumah for cooperating with the British colonial rulers. &quot;Nkrumah had said that chiefs would either have to side with the people, or one day they would have to run and leave their sandals behind.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;But far from aboloshing the chieftaincy, chiefs prospered under the national government. The present king of the Ashanti tribe, for instance, is a barrister and was once Ghana's ambassador to Rome,&quot; said Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He takes a sympathetic approach to the chiefs, believing their &quot;cooperation&quot; with the British in Ghana and with the National Part government in South Africa must be seen in a historial context. &quot;in Ghana the Ashantis fought the British intermittently between 1800 and 1900, when the British finally put down the last Ashanti uprising. The Ashanti king was exiled to the Seychelles with his senior chiefs until 1925. The minor chiefs, seeing what had happened to the bigger chiefs, caved in. It was a humiliating experience for their chiefs. They may have conformed outwardly, but in their hearts of hearts thet could never have loved colonial rule.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In South Africa, the defeat of the Zulu kingdom couldn't have been a badge of honour for the Zulu monarchs either. I won't be surprised if they feel the same (as the Ghanaian chiefs of pre-independence),&quot; said Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He hopes that South Africa's political parties will not turn chiefs into a &quot;political football&quot; in an election campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They would be more useful playing a healing role.. Throughout Africa, their role has been a standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">one: to represent the spiritual well-beng of communities&quot;,.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He does not believe chiefs should join either the ANC or the IFP.  &quot;If their are divisions, the cheifs should bring the two sides together -- every other thing is of secondary importance.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He believes South Africa should look at other West African countries when it maps out the future of chiefs under a new constiution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In Ghana we have a National House of Chiefs and we have Regional Houses in the ten regions. But they do not have a political role, nor do they seek one. They are part of our cultural heritage -- and we treasure them as such,&quot; said Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even though he has convinced chiefs -- who provide the IFP with support at grassroots levels -- to accommodate the ANC, Anafu has not had any confrontation with IFP leader chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. &quot;In every meeting I have had with him, he has promised me his whole-hearted support.  He told me that if I encounter any problems, I should approach him,&quot; said Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Much to the anger of local peace mediators, Anafu has left Durban to take up a new post in Johannesburg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sources close to him say the was reluctant to move -- but that he had to give into pressur from Commonwealth secretary general Chief Emeka Anyoukou. This, sources say, reflects the COmmonwealth's new focus on upcoming elections, and downscaling its peace role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As the secretary general's special representative in South Africa, i have to be close to where the poltician's are,&quot; said Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has sparked concern that the various initiatives he has spearheaded in Natal could flounder -- though Anafu brushed the fears aside.  &quot;my heart will always be in Natal. What we have built we will not allow to fall apart. I will keep my ear to the ground and assist wherever I can . When necessary I will come to Natal&quot;, said Anafu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He added that an earlier decision to close the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Durban office of the CoM has been overturned: new monitors will be stationed there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anafu -- who boasts a doctorate in history -- confirmed the Commonwealth intended playing a more prominent role in South Africa in the run-up to elections. &quot;We intend playing a more prominent role in South Africa in the run-up to elections.  &quot;We intend adding new dimensions to the evolving situation&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This would include sending in &quot;election experts&quot; to assist the Independent Electoral Commission, to send in &quot;media experts&quot; to ensure that media coverage is fair to all the political parties and to run training programmes in mediation and negotiation skills for grassroots activsits involved in peace initiatives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1254 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Forty-Sixth World Health Assembly adopted, by acclamation, a resolution on Maternal Child Health and Family Planning for Health that highlights the importance of eliminating harmful traditional practices and other social and behavioural obstacles affecting the health of women, children and adolescents. The resolution. underlines that the persistence of practices ''such as child marriage, dietary limitations during pregnancy and female genital mutilation, . . . . restrict the attainment of the goals of health, development and human rights for all members of society. The resolution was sponsored by a group of African countries - Guinea, Kenya, Nigeria, Togo and Zambia, and Lebanon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The World Health Assembly, in discussing the resolution and recognizing the progress made in maternal and child health and family planning, expressed confidence that WHO's strategy for the health of women and children would reduce by half the 500 000 deaths of women during pregnancy and childbirth and 4 million deaths of newborns that occur each year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is believed that over 80 million female infants, adolescents and women in over 3O countries of the world have been subject to female genital mutilation. However, because of the limited information that is available, the Assembly requested that the Director-General provide additional information on the scope and health implications of such traditional practices. Female genital mutilation is mainly practiced ln Eastern and Western Africa. In a number of countries such as Djibouti, Mali, Sierra Leone, Somalia and large areas of Ethiopia and Sudan, nearly all women are affected; in others, such as Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau and Kenya, the practice is common, affecting one-quarter to one- half of women. In other countries such as Mauritania, Togo, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania, the practice affects at least 5% of the population. Female genital mutilation is now found in countries such as Australia, Europe and North America among migrant groups. ''This traditional practice magnifies the inequity suffered by women in the communities where it is performed and must seriously be addressed if the health, social and economic development needs of women are to be met'', said Dr. Gabi Williams of the Delegation of Nigeria, when presenting the resolution on Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning for Health.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Female genital mutilation can lead to death or infertility. Among other complications, immediate risks include hemorrhage, tetanus, infection, and vesiculo-vaginal fistula. HIV infection can be contracted from the tools or instruments used. Long-term effects include problems of reproductive and general health such as urinary tract infections and coital difficulty, cysts and abscesses, keloid and severe scar formation, and difficulty when voiding and during menstruation. During childbirth, the risk of maternal death is doubled and the risk of a stillbirth increased several-fold. Moreover, during childbirth, the risk of hemorrhage and infection is greatly increased, and long-term morbidity becomes cumulative and chronic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The origins of female genital mutilation are difficult to trace. While it is believed that it was originally an attempt to ensure chaste or monogamous behaviours or as a means of suppressing female sexuality, others believe that it served to protect adolescent girls against rape.  Significantly, this practice is closely associated with poverty, illiteracy, and low status of women. In such settings, an uncircumcised woman is stigmatized, and not sought in marriage, which helps explain the paradox that the victims of the practice are among its strongest proponents, along with traditional midwives who perform the act. All these reasons point to the continuing cultural and traditional pressures which perpetuate the practice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of indirect consequences on the health of women and newborn infants also exist. Women are aware of the difficulty that they will have in childbirth in the presence of genital mutilation. As a consequence they will not eat enough during pregnancy in order not to gain too much weight and often exacerbate an already existing anemia, thus increasing the risk of hemorrhage and infection, as well as long-term morbidity, and increase the risk of low birth weight and pre-term delivery. This practice of limiting dietary intake during pregnancy is widespread among many other populations of women who also fear complications during childbirth. These fears are translated into restrictions or prohibitions against certain foods, particularly animal proteins and some vegetables. Furthermore, the custom of drinking large amounts of tea with meals inhibits the absorption of iron and thus aggravates anemia, which affects over 6O% of women in the developing world. The custom of women being fed last, and therefore least, further reduces women's access to adequate food intake .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Research carried out in developing countries, such as Ethiopia, Guinea and Nigeria have shown that when adolescent girls under 17 years of age become pregnant and do not receive proper care, between 3% and 5% will die.  These deaths occur because the girls are usually not fully developed physically, are frequently anemic and underweight, they have greater risks of complications during pregnancy and require specialized care during delivery.  If care is available and ''used'', these risks can be reduced significantly.  Unfortunately, because of such cultural obstacles as health care being provided by men, many women are inhibited from using these services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WHO has assured governments of its readiness to support national efforts against the perpetuation of harmful traditional practices, and to continue collaboration in research and dissemination of information. WHO has played a role that has included the provision of technical and financial support for national surveys, for the relevant training of traditional birth attendants, midwives and other health workers and for grassroots initiatives.  Moreover, WHO's programme areas of Women, Health and Development and Safe Motherhood, Adolescent Health and Nutrition collaborate very closely with other United Nations organizations and bodies involved in this field and have closely collaborated with the non governmental organizations working towards the elimination of these harmful traditional practices.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> July 28, 1993</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  In a status report submitted to the Security Council on 21 May 1993 (S/25818), I had informed the Council of my decision to visit the mission area in the first week of June, in pursuance of paragraph 2 of resolution 809 (1993), which called for an intensification of efforts in order to resolve outstanding issues, particularly those relating to the interpretation and application of the criteria for voter eligibility.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.  I visited the mission area from 31 May to 4 June 1993, accompanied by my Special Representative, Sahabzada Yaqub-Khan. The present document contains a report on my mission and on further efforts in pursuance of resolution 809 (1993).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.  At Rabat I was received by His Majesty King Hassan II of Morocco.  I also held meetings with the Prime Minister, Mr. Mohamed Karim Lamrani, the Minister of State, Mr. Moulay Ahmed Alaoui, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Mr. Abdellatif Filali, and the Minister of the Interior and Information, Mr. Driss Basri, and other senior officials.  In the area of Tindouf I met with the Secretary- General of the Frente Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Rio de Oro (POLISARIO), Mr.  Mohammed Abdelaziz.  Senior Frente POLISARIO officials were also present.  At Algiers I was received by the President of the Haut Comiti d'Etat, Mr. Ali Kafi.  Meetings were also held with the Head of Government, Mr. Belaid Abdeslam, and other members of the Haut Comiti d'Etat, Mr. Redha Malek, Minister for Foreign Affairs, and General Khaled Nazzar, Minister of Defence.  While on a subsequent mission at Vienna from 10 to 17 June, I held further consultations with the Permanent Representative of Morocco to the United Nations, Mr. Ahmed Snoussi, the POLISARIO Coordinator with the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), Mr. Mustafa Bachir Sayed, and the Foreign Minister of Algeria, as well as the Permanent Representative of Mauritania to the United Nations, Mr. Mohamedou Ould Mohamed Mahmoud.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.  Additionally, the current Chairman and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) were kept regularly informed of ongoing efforts in pursuance of Security Council resolution 809 (1993).  Other senior government officials from States members of the Security Council were briefed by me on the Western Sahara question during my visits to Paris and Vienna.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.  The aim of my visit to the mission area was to urge the parties to accept a compromise solution with regard to the interpretation and application of the criteria for voter eligibility.  To this effect I presented to the parties a comprehensive text (see annex I) based on talks with the parties in August and September 1992 and on their comments regarding the outline of a possible compromise which my Special Representative had proposed during a visit to the mission area in March 1993.  I invited the parties to convey to me as early as possible their views regarding the acceptability of my compromise proposals, to enable me to submit recommendations to the Security Council in a full report in pursuance of resolution 809 (1993).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6.  To follow up my discussions with the authorities concerned, my Special Representative held another round of meetings in the mission area from 5 to 20 June 1993.  During these and subsequent consultations, both parties reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation of the peace plan in its entirety and their determination to move towards an early referendum.  Both parties stressed that they did not reject the proposed compromise but expressed reservations on certain provisions of the text. Reservations expressed by the authorities at Rabat centred on specific provisions concerning tribal links with the Territory which, in their view, were unduly restrictive.  In spite of these concerns, Morocco has since acquiesced in the compromise in its present form.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7.  For its part the Frente POLISARIO conveyed to the Special Representative its acceptance of all the criteria for voter eligibility enunciated by my predecessor in the annex to his report of 19 December 1991 (S/23299), thus signifying a favourable change in the earlier position of the Frente POLISARIO which had consistently objected to several of these criteria.  With regard to the proposed compromise on the interpretation and application of the criteria for voter eligibility, the Frente POLISARIO also conveyed its acceptance of oral testimony in support of individual applications for participation in the referendum, which indicates another favourable change in its earlier position. However, in expressing substantial reservations on the compromise, the POLISARIO authorities proposed several amendments to the text. Their reservations and proposed amendments concern primarily provisions relating to tribal links with the Territory and to the composition of the tribal chiefs (shiukhs) invited to testify, which they consider unduly permissive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8.  As is well known, we have consistently sought to encourage direct talks between the parties as a way of facilitating the implementation of the peace plan.  It was therefore gratifying to learn that, shortly after my visit to the mission area, both parties finally agreed to initiate direct talks in mid-July at Laayoune and to ask for the assistance of the United Nations in holding this meeting. Notwithstanding difficulties in the preparation and organization of the talks and other problems, mostly of a procedural nature, the delegations of Morocco and the Frente POLISARIO met from 17 to 19 July 1993 at Laayoune, in the presence of my Special Representative as United Nations observer. While it would have been unrealistic to expect a major breakthrough on substantial issues - nor was this the primary aim of the talks - it was an encouraging sign that this exploratory dialogue was held in a positive spirit, marked by restraint and mutual respect.  Neither party has excluded the possibility of resuming the talks for wider discussions on issues of mutual concern.  It is my earnest hope that such talks will soon be resumed as a follow-up to the Laayoune initiative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9.  In paragraph 3 of its resolution 809 (1993), the Security Council further asked for preparations for the holding of the referendum and urged that voter registration commence promptly, starting with the updated lists of persons included in the 1974 census.  Pursuant to this request, Mr. Erik Jensen was appointed Chairman of the Identification Commission in May 1993 and immediately travelled to Rabat, Laayoune, Tindouf, Algiers and Nouakchott with a view to initiating the process of identification and registration of voters.  He also assembled the members of the Commission and a team of registration officers.  The former group arrived in Laayoune in June.  On the basis of the mandate (see annex II) promulgated on 26 April 1993 in conformity with the relevant provisions of the settlement plan and article 11 of the general regulations of 8 November 1991 (see annex III), the Identification Commission began work on establishing with the authorities of both parties the detailed procedures for identification and registration, starting in the Laayoune and Tindouf areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10.  Proposals regarding specific measures to initiate the above process were at first agreed, but reservations expressed subsequently made it necessary to modify certain aspects.  Further discussions, which were facilitated by the presence of both parties at the direct talks in Laayoune, have since led to revised proposals for the organization of work, which should now make it possible for the actual identification and registration of potential voters to start. Meanwhile, the complicated but essential practical and logistical arrangements have been proceeding, registration materials are being prepared and most of the specialized technical equipment is expected to arrive shortly. One Identification Commission team has been deployed to Tindouf to begin preliminary work in that area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11.  The Police Commissioner, Colonel Jurgen Friedrich Reimann (Germany), who assumed his functions in May 1993 as Head of the Security Unit of MINURSO, arrived in the mission area, with a small contingent of 19 civilian police officers from Belgium (5), Germany (4), Malaysia (5) and Togo (5). This first contingent will accompany the registration teams to provide security and order at the various sites for registering voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12.  The above report outlines factual developments related to my visit to the mission area and events that followed it.  The intensification of efforts to overcome existing difficulties has contributed to the holding of direct talks between the parties which, if sustained, will hopefully facilitate the implementation of the settlement plan.  The progress towards the registration of voters, which is gathering momentum, is another concrete step. The exchange of views has sharpened focus on outstanding issues.  Foremost among these is the urgency of the acceptance of the compromise on the interpretation and application of the eligibility criteria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13.  I intend to submit in due course a full report to the Security Council in pursuance of resolution 809 (1993). -30NEWS RELEASE</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Dear Mr. Secretary:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are delighted, as we know you are, that the warring factions in Liberia reached agreement last week on a cease- fire and new transitional political arrangements. This breakthrough creates a real opportunity for ending the three and a half year old civil war which has devastated Liberia. Relief organizations estimate that nearly 150,000 lives have been lost in the conflict.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the long historical ties between the United States and Liberia, and because of the unwitting support that U.S. provided to the Doe regime during the 1980's, the United States has a special responsibility to do all in our power to ensure that this opportunity for peace is not lost. Our interest in ensuring that the settlement holds is heightened given the current political instability in Nigeria, which has provided the bulk of the ECOMOG peacekeeping forces in Liberia. This may be our last and best chance to restore political order in that troubled land.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the past, Charles Taylor, head of the NPFL faction, has not implemented agreements that have been reached with his opponents.  There is a real risk of this happening again. Taylor is convinced that the Nigerians are not a neutral force, but are committed to the Sawyer regime, and pose a direct physical threat to him and his forces. To respond to this concern, the peace plan proposes to expand the U.N. observer mission in Liberia and bring in non-West African forces (from Tanzania, Zimbabwe and Egypt) to supplement existing ECOMOG troops. This is primarily an African solution to an African problem, and should be encouraged.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We believe that the viability of the current agreement will depend upon the rapid deployment of additional U.N. personnel and non-West African troops.  Without these confidence-building measures, there is little reason to believe that Taylor will not return to hostilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We urge you to do all in your power to assure that these confidence-buildingmeasures are undertaken. We realize that the problem here is money, and that resources for peacekeeping initiatives are almost completely exhausted. But we believe that the United States, in the past, has not been active enough in working to avoid Liberia's descent into anarchy. We now have the opportunity to make amends for this failing. We are willing and eager to work with the Administration to address the financial problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to hearing from you on this issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The White House, Office of the Press Secretary 7/28/93 The United States welcomes the recent signing of the Liberia peace agreement. This accord holds the promise of finally ending a destructive conflict that has racked Liberia, killed over one hundred thousand people and created over half a million refugees.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">We have provided over $250 million in humanitarian assistance to victims of the conflict and believe the new accord can put Liberia back on a path toward political reconciliation, national elections and civil reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. commends and continues to support the sustained peace effort in Liberia by the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States, and the Organization for African Unity. Their joint effort has succeeded in bringing the Liberation parties closer together and sets a model for conflict resolution in Africa and elsewhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. urges the parties to the agreement to adhere strictly to the commitments they have made. The accord will only succeed if they work in good faith with one another and with the international community. The parties can provide an early signal of their commitment to the accord by cooperating fully with the international relief agencies in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and we urge them to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 4, 1993 On June 12, 1993, the people of Nigeria elected M.K.O.  Abiola as Nigeria's new President-Elect. Mr. Abiola was the leader of a democracy movement that was taking place in Nigeria that was comparable to the recent celebrated democratization movements in Poland, Germany, and Russia. On June 12, Nigeria was well on its way of becoming a member of the community of democratic nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But, the military dictator, General Ibrahim Babangida, annulled the election of Mr. Abiola on untenable grounds. Although this election was judged fair and free by international observed nations including Great Britain, General Babangida acted against the wishes of the 14 million people that voted in the June 12th election. The democratization of Nigeria now has been halted by the actions of General Babangida.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would hope that this committee would take a strong stand in support of the August 27th date as the date that Mr. Abiola is to assume office and the date of significant consequences for the relationship between Nigeria and the United States. The nearly 100 million people of Nigeria who make up nearly a quarter of the population of Africa deserve democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unless Mr. Abiola is allowed to take office, it may be necessary for our country to take severe action against General Babangida including withdrawals of pending debt relief, cancellation of cooperative agreements, freezing of official bank accounts, denial of entry to the U.S. by certain Nigerian officials, refusing to honor letters of credit or to allow export guarantees, and a reduction in diplomatic relations, among other possible actions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Boris Yeltsin became a symbol of democracy around the world when he stood atop the tanks of the Soviet military to demand an end to military backed political rule. Mr. Abiola is showing the same courage and heroism that Mr. Yeltsin showed, except it is being done in relative obscurity out of sight of CNN cameras and therefore out of mind of most of the people in the west, indeed in the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just as our nation rallied to Yeltsin and his countrymen as they faced down tanks, let us now give our national commitment to Mr. Abiola and the people of Nigeria as they confront the guns of military rule and seek to take the reins of their government.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yinka Dare is the talk of American college basketball.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 20-year-old Nigerian centre took the George Washington University Colonials to their first National Collegiate Championship in 32 years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The team eventually lost to the University of Michigan. But along the way a nationwide television audience saw why Dare is the best first-year player in America. At 2.15 metres, the 125 kilo Dare led the league in rebounding and averaged 12.6 points a game. His 56.3 percent field goal shooting was the team's best. His 109 blocked shots set a single season school record. All from a young man who first picked up a basketball just four years ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Born in Kabba, mid-west Nigeria, Yinka moved to Kano, with his family where his father, Jaiye is a civil engineer and avid tennis player.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though most young Nigerians are more interested in football, Dare says his size and the fast inside play of basketball attracted him to the game in an informal street league at Kano Pillars Park.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;At first I didn't like it too much because I was struggling,&quot; he remembers. &quot;I wasn't good at all and everybody was getting at me. It was tough for me. But then as I started getting good I saw the improvement I was making gradually. It became a challenge to me to make myself to be better than anybody I played with.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Within six months, he was. Another six months on the Kano Pillars state team and Dare tries out for Nigeria's national squad. There he faced older, more experienced players who showed him he still had much to learn about the game.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In February 1991, George Washington University assistant basketball coach Ed Meyers saw Dare play in Lagos. He looked awkward taking jump shots from the top of the key, but when Dare drove the lane and took the ball to the hoop with a one-step dunk, Meyers was a believer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rules governing American collegiate recruitment of young players forbade Meyers from speaking with Dare. But Meyers befriended a Nigerian air force lieutenant who knew the family and Dare was soon on his way to the Milford Academy in Connecticut to finish high school. At Milford, training improved his bench press weight from 55 kilos to 140 kilos. An honours student, Dare's powerful overhead dunk once shattered a backboard.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On his arrival at George Washington, he roomed with Gambian fourth year centre Adama Kah. A Graduate of St. Augustine's High School in Banjul, Kah helped Dare open a bank account and introduced him to American fast food.  Care says he prefers pounded yam.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When I first got here, I think he was the perfect roommate for me because he knew where I was coming from and it was easy to relate to him,&quot; Dare said. &quot;Adama helped me get used to what I was coming to.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having demonstrated he can play with the best in Division I college ball, scouts saw how far he goes from here is largely up to him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;When he learns the game he's going to be a monster,&quot; assistant coach Meyers said. &quot;He's come a long way and he's got a long way to go. If he's patient in his development and works hard, the sky's the limit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There have already been flashes of brilliance. With less than two seconds left and down 79-77 to Rutgers, Dare caught a full-court pass and converted a layup at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. George Washington won 106- 100. Dare finished with a career high 26 points.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Colonial's head coach Mike Jarvis thinks Dare could be as good as Patrick Ewing, the starting centre for the New York Knicks, who coached Jarvis in high school. The U.S. press often compare Dare to another Nigerian, Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets, or the most dominant first professional this season, Shaquille O'Neal of the Orlando Magic.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dare is the first to admit he must become a more complete player. He's working on a ten-foot jump shot and a jump hook to spread out tight defenses under the basket. Treatment for exercise-induced asthma has helped his endurance on the floor. He needs to foul less.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Right now, my parents are not even concerned about basketball as much as my education,&quot; he said. &quot;They don't know how big it is here. I can't explain it to them. I didn't think basketball was this big.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dare is pursuing a degree in business administration and says he enjoys living in the nation's capital. But more and more college players are leaving school early to turn pro, and Dare admits he may consider leaving George Washington before his senior year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;If I can turn pro, I'll go, but I don't know when,&quot; he said. &quot;I have to consider everything. I can't honestly say I'm going to say here four years. I can't see that far ahead yet.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Nigerian community here herald Dare as an example of soft-spoken excellence in an American culture which they complain unduly portrays Nigeria as a country of drug dealers and military repression.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I can only carry myself in a good way to reflect good on my country,&quot; he says. &quot;Right now I can't afford to do anything that would damage the name of Nigerians here, and you know I wouldn't even think of doing anything like that.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He thinks often of his family at home on a quiet, tree- lined street in Kano. Brother Mike and sister Christine write of their new two-year-old sister Tobi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They know me, because I never write,&quot; he says apologetically. &quot;I know they're getting mad right now. I'll write soon enough. Tell them I'm doing good right here.&quot; Scott Stearns reports for FOCUS ON AFRICA from Washington.  -30T. Brew, 2400 Cleveland Street, Portsmouth, VA 23707.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normally stable Cote d'Ivoire was rocked in March when the elite Republican Guard took to the streets. Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports on the country's increasingly uncertain future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Soldiers have mutinied before in Cote d'Ivoire, but to seize control of the presidential palace in the heart of Abidjan in a protest over pay was unprecedented. It was also a measure of the increasing desperation and generalized malaise in a country that was once the envy of its neighbors.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the 1960's and 1970s, Cote d'Ivoire's cocoa and coffee driven economy was the pride of West Africa; but the collapse in the value of both commodities in recent years has had serious consequences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It took the personal intervention of octogenarian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny to calm the jumpy, volatile soldiers. But the incident shocked Ivorians. For the first time, Houphouet's hallowed portals had been invaded. It was seen as a slap in the face for the president, a deliberate, defiant gesture of disrespect, and he was said to be furious. A worrying sign of things to come?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The 'hands on' approach to sensitive national issues has always been very much the style of the veteran Ivorian leader; the 'Grand Old Man' of African politics, 'Le Vieux, Le Doyen.' His official age is put at 87, though Houphouet- watchers say a few years appear to have gone missing. After</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the mutiny, there were the inevitable questions: is he losing his touch?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But for the moment, President Houphouet-Boigny remains, at least at his home, master of the situation. Within the region though, his prestige has recently taken a battering. There has been the failure first of peace talks on Liberia and then Angola, both conducted under the auspices of 'Le Vieux.' The self-styled peace broker often looks uncomfortably meddlesome and partisan; a man who cannot resist the temptation to take sides in regional conflicts, backing first the Biafrans, then Unita's Jonas Savimbi and latterly Charles Taylor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the domestic front, Houphouet's succession remains the great unanswered question. But 'Le Vieux' is keeping his cards close to his chest.  The Ivorian president does not appear to have made any preparations for the event, nor has he openly groomed a successor - despite the presence of many hopefuls waiting in the wings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Take Henry Konan Bedie, 58, President of the National Assembly, who, in accordance with the constitution, ought to take over from the president if he dies or is unfit to govern. Cote d'Ivoire's ambassador to the United States when he was only 27, Bedie is a chubby-faced southerner, a Catholic and a Baoule from the same ethnic group as Houphouet-Boigny, and is considered quietly ambitious. He is seen very much as Houphouet's spiritual son.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bedie's main rival is the prime minister, the 51 year- old Alassane Dramane Ouattara, a former International Monetary Fund economist and technocrat, from the predominantly Muslim north. He was brought in by the president in late 1990 to rescue Cote d'Ivoire's ailing economy. If Ouattara has a weakness, it could be his lack of political experience and absence of an established powerbase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Those with presidential ambitions are jockeying for power. But they do so gingerly. No one - except the opposition - talks openly about succession.  However, the rivalry is palpable between Ouattara - determined to push through his unpopular privatization program - and Bedie, who has taken delight in challenging it. Their conflict has become public; but the president took his time before reacting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Houphouet finally called together the members of his ruling PDCI party - the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast - and sharply reminded them, &quot;I'm still here.&quot; He then proceeded to call both Bedie and Ouattara good men, renewing his confidence in both and consequently giving nothing away.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Outside the party which has ruled the country since independence, but also with presidential ambitions, is Laurent Gbagbo of the FPI, the Ivorian Popular Front Party. Not perhaps the threat he appeared to be a couple of years ago, Gbagbo remains very popular in the towns and cities. But like everything else, Gbagbo's political agenda remains set by the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It's two years before Ivorians will be called upon to vote for a new leader. But already Houphouet's PDCI party appears to have embarked on its election campaign. Earlier this year a 'peace caravan' in honor of the president toured the country. But back in Abidjan, 'Le Vieux' refuses to pronounce on whether he will be seeking a eighth term in office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the president's most visible foible and ultimate indulgence - the huge multi-million dollar basilica built in splended isolation in his hometown, Yamoussoukro has led to cheeky conjecture that politics aside, Felix Houphouet- Boigny is preparing his place in heaven.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of Congress are pressing the Clinton administration to step up support for a new peace accord in the west African nation of Liberia, devastated by three and a half years of civil war. A cease-fire went into effect on August 1, a week after Liberia's warring factions signed an agreement that calls for disarming and demobilizing all combatants and holding national elections under United Nations supervision early next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The conflict has killed 150,000 people and uprooted nearly half the population of 2.5 million, many of whom are in refugee camps in neighboring countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Calls for diplomatic and financial commitment to the peace plan have come from both the Senate and House and from both sides of the aisle. Citing &quot;a special responsibility to Liberia,&quot; which was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves, Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) said U.S. action to support &quot;this tenuous peace accord&quot; is urgent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As many as 500 Liberian children a week are still dying from war-related causes, according to the United Nations Children's Fund. Recent fighting has blocked relief efforts in parts of the country, leaving more than 200,000 Liberians at risk from starvation and in need of immediate aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Members of the United Nations are looking to us to take the lead,&quot; said Rep. Harry Johnston (D-FL), chairman of the House Africa subcommittee. &quot;This may be our last and best chance to restore political order in that troubled land,&quot; Johnston said last week in an appeal to the State Department co-signed by the subcommittee's ranking Republican, Dan Burton (R-IN).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace pact, signed on July 25 by the interim Liberian government, the rebel movement known as the Patriotic Front and a militia of former Liberian soldiers called Ulimo, was sponsored by the United Nations, the Economic Community of West African States, and the Organization of African Unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Under the accord, a West African peacekeeping force of 11,000 that has been in Liberia since 1990 will be strengthened by four or five battalions from African nations outside the region. About 300 United Nations observers are scheduled to monitor the cease-fire process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Administration officials have voiced support for the peace effort, which a White House statement called &quot;a model for conflict resolution in Africa and elsewhere.&quot; But the officials concede that with so many issues vying for attention and resources, Liberia faces stiff competition. An interagency task force has been created to examine how U.S. assistance might be directed to back the international effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a recent Senate hearing, Simon called upon the administration to abandon the &quot;excessive caution&quot; of past Liberian policy. Johnston and Burton said the U.S. government had not been &quot;active enough in working to avoid Liberia's descent into anarchy&quot; and now needs to &quot;make amends for this failing.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Congressional critics say the Bush administration erred by refusing to respond when the Liberian civil war began in late 1989.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The outbreak of fighting followed a century of close ties between the two countries, and a decade of U.S. backing for an unpopular regime that made Liberia the largest per capita recipient of U.S. aid in sub-Saharan Africa.  But as the government disintegrated and rebellion spread in the countryside during 1990, Bush adopted a severely limited diplomatic posture. According to officials who were in the State Department and Pentagon at the time, the White House vetoed several proposals to facilitate peace efforts, including using U.S. Marines stationed on four naval ships offshore to keep order in the capital, Monrovia, before it degenerated into Somalia-like anarchy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Marines did intervene when fighting overran Monrovia in August of 1990, but only to evacuate American personnel from the embassy and two CIA communications facilities. The United States also supplied about $300 million in humanitarian aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With deaths mounting, the 16-nation West African Community stepped into the breach, sending 7,000 troops who separated the warring sides, stopped the wholesale slaughter and brokered a series of fragile cease-fires.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capitol Hill's Africa specialists say the White House response to the latest peace plan will be a test of administration support for Africa's recent moves towards democracy. Although senior Clinton strategists, including National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, have said Africa is a priority concern, Simon, who chairs the Senate Africa subcommittee, said the continent remains &quot;more on the back burner than is desirable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A similar view is expressed in the House by Congressional Black Caucus members and others who want to see a more active Africa policy. The House Africa subcommittee, with Republican backing, has asked administration officials to give greater attention to the humanitarian crises in Angola, Sudan and Zaire that are legacies of superpower competition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving added urgency to the concern for Liberia is the fear that the peace accord could unravel if support operations are not established rapidly.  &quot;Funding must be found to get this started right away or we could see Liberia plunged back into full-scale war,&quot; said Richard Joseph, Africa specialist at the Carter Center in Atlanta, which has played a behind-the-scenes role in the negotiating process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to ask for a U.S.  airlift of the new African battalions, slated to come from Zimbabwe, Egypt, and perhaps Tanzania, and to seek American funding and gear to equip the peace keepers for a multifaceted mission that includes cease-fire monitoring, weapons collection and warehousing, border control, and the encampment and demobilization of former soldiers from all sides.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The timing couldn't be worse. Peacekeeping budgets in both New York and Washington are overstretched, Congress is on summer recess, and several key UN and U.S. officials are on vacation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, Liberians from all sides appear more optimistic than at any time since the war started. Amos Sawyer, a former university professor who has headed the interim government since its formation under West African auspices, said in a telephone interview from Monrovia that the current agreement differs in two important respects from previous failed accords. &quot;We learned from sad experience that leaving things to good faith did not work out well, so we bargained hard for these terms,&quot; Sawyer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The strong disarmament provisions give West African troops the authority to seize weapons and &quot;warlike materials&quot; that are not handed over voluntarily and to search for lost or hidden guns. And where previous peace plans left Liberia a divided state under the control of rival administrations, the new accord unifies the country under a single authority prior to elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both Sawyer's administration and the rival Patriotic Front government established by rebel leader Charles Taylor are to be dissolved by the end of this month, replaced by a five- member transitional council and a 35-member legislative assembly. All three Liberian factions have named a representative to the Council, which will chose its own chairperson and select two additional members from three nominees submitted by each group. The interim government and Taylor's Patriotic Front will name 13 members each to the assembly, with Ulimo choosing the other nine. None of the participants in the transitional government will be allowed to seek office in the elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This month's cease-fire ends a new military offensive launched by Taylor last October after two years of precarious peace. The rebel leader, who denounced the West African intervention as a Nigerian-led effort to keep him from taking power, vowed to force the peacekeepers out of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Taylor's army, which had controlled much of Liberia's territory, suffered a series of defeats when West African troops captured the large Firestone rubber plantation and the U.S.-built international airport in February, and seized the port city of Buchanan in May. Loss of the port ended profitable rebel exports of iron ore, timber, rubber and diamonds used to finance imports of arms and other supplies. A regional economic embargo further squeezed Taylor's once- ample coffers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Grace Minor, a Taylor spokesperson in the United States, acknowledged that the Patriotic Front has suffered economically. But she said financial pressures were not the reason Taylor agreed to the latest peace plan. The new agreement is a &quot;good solution&quot; that should end the fighting because it was drawn up by all the Liberian parties and was not &quot;imposed by outsiders,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the peace agreement calls for opening all roads to relief convoys, free movement exists only on paper. Military officers on both sides appear intent on awaiting the arrival of UN observers to verify that aid shipments contain no weapons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a report to the Security Council last Tuesday, Boutros- Ghali promised to dispatch an advance team of observers &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; A UN technical team has arrived in Monrovia to identify ways to speed up emergency relief and to draft plans for establishing an observer mission in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several American organizations including the Carter Center and National Democratic Institute have drawn up plans to provide monitors for the elections. -30COTE D'IVOIRE'S HOUPHOUET-BOIGNY: SO OLD, SO WISE?</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The AFRICATREK Cycling Expedition, led by Dan Buettner, is about to complete its unprecedented bicycle journey across Africa. On August 17, after cycling 11,500 miles across grueling terrain, including the Sahara Desert and the jungles of Zaire, the team set a world record when they arrived at Cape Agulhas, located at the southernmost tip of South Africa. The team dipped the front wheels of their Cannondale mountain bikes in the ocean to symbolize the end of the expedition. The three American team members will return home to the United States via KLM Royal Dutch Airlines on August 28. On November 24, 1992, Dan Buettner, along with his team consisting of two black and two white men, set out to capture a world record for bicycling from the north to the south of Africa. During the 10 month expedition, the team experienced incredible obstacles, including military skirmishes in Algeria and Zaire, being arrested twice, surviving five bouts of malaria, and enduring a three week period where they each ate about 70 bananas a day to survive! The team cycled 1200 miles through the Sahara on the classic trans-Saharan highway (Route du Hoggar). They encountered roads ranging from well-paved to boulder-laden to deep sand. In order to survive from oasis to oasis, the team carried condensed milk and dates, and used a 20 liter water bag developed by WTC Industries Inc. The bag which fits into the bike frame, automatically purifies water with PentaPure Water Purifier technology. Dan Buettner commented, &quot;With all the challenges we encountered, at least with the PentaPure system we were able to count on clean water throughout Africa.&quot; When the team reached Tamanrasset, the last major oasis town in the Sahara, they were informed that the border was closed on their proposed route between Niger and Algeria. The team then traveled another 150 miles sough through virgin desert in quest of a seldom used border crossing, but unfortunately got caught and separated in a blinding sandstorm. After reuniting, the team returned to Tamanrasset where they traveled back to Algiers and caught a plane to Niamey, Niger. From Niamey to Lagos, the team cycled through a region called the Sahel, which is sandwiched between the desert and the tropics. The conditions were hot and hazy with barren, charred landscape caused by &quot;slash and burn&quot; agricultural practices.  The roads in Nigeria were some of the best the team encountered, but the traffic was &quot;unbelievably bad.&quot; Daily, the team passed overturned and abandoned trucks on the roadside. They were also shocked to pass two dead bodies that appeared to have been hit by cars and left for months on the side of the road. To ensure their personal safety, the team wore 3M Scotchlite Reflective Material on their clothes to make them more visible. The most challenging part of the expedition was a three week stretch through the rainforest of Zaire. To avoid military and rebel forces, the cyclists stayed on little- used mud-paths through the rainforest. For three weeks the team cycled about 60 miles per day with little food and under harsh conditions.  Team members emerged from Zaire about 20 pounds lighter. As the team cycled through eastern Africa, food became more plentiful and the roads smoother. In Dar Es Salaam, the team helped distribute over 500 bicycles which had been gathered by Burnsville, Minnesota Rotary Club in Conjunction with trek. The donated bicycles were given to schools and medical clinics in Tanzania and Kenya. In South Africa, the AFRICATREK team met with Walter Sisulu, the Vice President of the ANC, and President F.W. de Klerk, who hailed AFRICATREK as &quot;a courageous effort to help break down barriers between the peoples of Africa and the rest of the world.&quot; President de Klerk also added that he would like to take up biking himself, but would need six extra bikes for his body guards! Back in the United States, the expedition was followed by close to a million students who used a study guide produced by Land O'Lakes and Nystrom, studied the weekly updates and read about the team's adventures in &quot;Weekly Reader&quot;, &quot;Junior Scholastic&quot; and &quot;Sports Illustrated for Kids&quot;. Many of these supporters will attend the AFRICATREK homecoming event sponsored by Target Stores at the Hubert Humphrey Terminal at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on August 28th at 4:45 p.m. St. Paul native Dan Buettner, 33, a published author and charismatic speaker, has led bicycle trips around the world through the former Soviet Union, and from Alaska to Argentina for which he and his brother Steve hold a world record. Dan Buettner is also a recent winner of the Polartec Performance Challenge award.  He has appeared on the Today Show, Late Night with David Letterman, CNN, and Bill Cosby's To Tell the Truth. Other team members include: Steve Buettner, 28, the team's mechanic and James (Chip) Thomas, MD, 35, of Arizona, the team's doctor. Nigerian, Mobolaji Oduyoye, 30 served as the team's language expert for the first half of the expedition and was replaced by Ugandan, Michael Mpyangu, 29, for the second leg. When asked about the team's greatest accomplishment, Dan Buettner commented, &quot;We pulled together five people from vastly different backgrounds to cross perhaps the most difficult continent on earth -- and emerged as friends.&quot; NOTE: Interviews with Dan Buettner and the other team members are available in the United States at a press conference at the Humphrey Terminal at the Minneapolis/St. Paul airport at 4:45 PM on August 28. B-roll footage, photographs, and slides from the expedition are also available. The public is invited to meet Dan Buettner on August 29th from 1:00-2:30 PM at the Woodbury, MN, Target store.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Secretary-General deplores the incident on 8 August in which four United States army soldiers serving with the United Nations Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM II) were killed when their vehicle, while on a routine patrol in south Mogadishu, was hit by a large explosive device, probably detonated by remote control.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Secretary-General's instructions, UNOSOM II is investigating the incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This cowardly attack on United Nations peace-keepers in Somalia demonstrates the urgent need to accomplish the total disarmament of the factions and militias still holding weapons in Mogadishu and the rest of Somalia. The perpetrators of the attacks will not succeed in thwarting the objectives of UNOSOM II mandated by the Security Council. Those objectives are the provision of humanitarian assistance; political reconciliation; and re-establishment of Somali political institutions. The maintenance of a secure environment throughout Somalia is indispensable for the achievement of those objectives. -30AFRICATREK TEAM RETURNS</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 9, 1993 NAIROBI -- Since July 26th, many innocent civilians that live in the villages between Yei and Morobo (Southern Sudan) have become daily victims of heavy bombing from the Government of Khartoum. This air bombing has greatly intensified - morning, noon and evening - since August 3rd. This is not only a breach of the cease-fire, but a most atrocious genocide of hundreds of innocent people in the vicinity of Kaya. Begining on August 5th, this bombing has caused about 100,000 people to flee Kaya and its vicinity into northern Uganda, Zaire, and other areas inside Sudan. These people are without shelter, blankets, utensils, food,and medicines at the very peak of the rainy season.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of this situation we are calling on the international community to take immediate and appropriate measures to stop Khartoum's continuous and brutal killing of innocent Southern Sudanese civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We request the UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros 1. To urge all combatants to observe a cease-fire and</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ghali, to take action of the following: to stop the killing of innocent civilians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2. To stop the Khartoum Government from bombing civilian population in villages and re-settlement camps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3. To impose a military air exclusion zone over the southern Sudan and Nuba mountains with immediate effect from 12 GMT, 10 August, 1993.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4. To create safe-havens in Western and Eastern Equatoria, Bahr-el Ghazal, the Nuba Mountains and Upper Nile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5. To enforce the adherence of all warring parties in the south and Nuba Mountains to respect the peace of the demilitarized zones and safe-havens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6. To monitor the situation on the ground with UN security personnel.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Church has raised her voice on numerous other occasions. Once more the Church raises her voice on behalf of the desperate civilians, suffering in Southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains. These people continue to undergo inhumane treatment and the most serious violation of human rights. We encourage not only the effort to supply essential humanitarian materials but also the effort of the UN, NGOs and the international community to impede the Khartoum Government's indiscriminate attacks on civilians.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International is concerned about the killing of more than 30 civilians and the injuring of over 150 others during clashes on 8 August 1993 between demonstrators and security forces in the northern district (quartier nordiste) of the capital, N'Djamena. The security forces reportedly used automatic weapons and rockets to disperse the demonstrators. The authorities have announced that four gendarmes and three policemen were killed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The demonstration was organized by the Ouaddai community in N'Djamena to protest against the apparent failure by the government to protect people in eastern Chad's Ouaddai prefecture from killings and other abuses. About 80 unarmed civilians were massacred on 6 August 1993 in Chokoyan village, about 100 kilometres east of Ouaddai's capital, Abeche, when an armed gang, thought by some to be members of former minister Abbas Koty, surrounded a market there and opened fire indiscriminately. The authorities have announced that government troops broke up the gang and arrested its leader.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the Gendarmerie were reportedly sent to prevent the demonstration, which the authorities have said was unauthorized, and were stoned by some in the crowd. The authorities have claimed some of the demonstrators shot at the gendarmes. The Republican Guard, a unit of the Chadian army directly responsible to President Idriss Deby, was subsequently deployed to support the gendarmes and they used automatic weapons and bazooka rockets against the crowd, resulting in the heavy death toll. There have been reports that several wounded civilians were removed from ambulances and shot at point blank range by members of the security forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The authorities have announced that 203 civilians have been detained for interrogation in connection with the violence. It is unclear whether an independent inquiry will be ordered to establish whether the use of automatic weapons and bazooka rockets was legitimate and whether the deaths and injuries could have been prevented or minimized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BACKGROUND INFORMATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More than 800 people, many of them unarmed civilians have been executed extrajudicially since President Idriss Deby came to power in December 1990. Many of them have been killed in custody or during attacks by members of the security forces on known or suspected government opponents or members of their ethnic groups. Members of the Ouaddai community appear to have been among those particularly targeted on a number of occasions. (For example, see UA 254/92, AFR 20/09/92, 5 August 1992).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International is investigating reports of killings, looting and other human rights violations in recent months by members of the security forces in Ouaddai prefecture. The authorities are not known to have taken any action to investigate the reports and bring those responsible to justice. The violations have been exacerbated by attacks on civilians by unidentified armed gangs, some of them thought to be rebels. Lack of government action and the apparent impunity enjoyed by members of the security forces have left the population unable to distinguish between abuses by government troops and by other armed gangs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/telexes/faxes and airmail letters either in</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">August 10, 1993 -- Amnesty International is gravely concerned by reports that at least 35 people in Kaa town in Rivers State have been extrajudicially executed by armed men, some of whom are believed to have been in navy and police uniforms, on 4 August 1993. The victims, who are from the Ogoni ethnic group, are believed to include at least three young children and the husband of Maria Nwiku, who was herself injured in the attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Local government officials maintain that the attack was part of an ethnic clash between the Ogoni people and the neighbouring Adoni people, from whose lands the attackers came. However, the removal of all Ogoni policemen from the region three weeks prior to the attack and the military's failure to restore order in Kaa strongly suggest that the attack had the support of the military.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Amnesty International deplores the apparently deliberate extrajudicial execution of members of the Ogoni ethnic group. It is calling on the Nigerian government to halt these killings and to conduct an immediate, thorough and impartial investigation to determine whether the security forces were involved, and with a view to bringing all those responsible for the killings to justice. Amnesty International also calls on the Nigerian authorities to safeguard the security of all Ogoni people, including those who have fled the area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> BACKGROUND INFORMATION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Ogoni community has been campaigning against the environmental damage to their homeland in Rivers State and the destruction of their land and crops caused by the extraction of petrochemicals by oil companies, including Shell and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), for which they have received no compensation. The Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) has been active in defending the rights of the Ogoni community and in raising awareness of their plight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Ken Saro-Wiwa, spokesperson for MOSOP, was arrested on two separate occasions in April 1993 and again on 21 June 1993 with N.G. Dube and Kobari Nwile, both active members of MOSOP. All three were charged on 13 July 1993 under the Criminal code of Eastern Nigeria in connection with their activities on behalf of the Ogoni community (see UA 238/93, AFR 44/07/93, 20 July 1993). Ken Saro-Wiwa was released on bail because of a heart condition in the week beginning 26 July 1993 and is believed to still be in hospital.  The other two are believed to still be in detention.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Security Council SC/5683, 3263rd Meeting 10 August 1993 -- The Security Council this afternoon approved the dispatch to Liberia of an advance team of 30 military observers to monitor, investigate and report cease- fire violations, as called for in the Cotonou Agreement signed on 25 July by the parties to the conflict in that country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mandate of the advance team would expire within three months, according to resolution 856 (1993) which was adopted unanimously by the Council. Also by that text, the Council welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to send a technical team to Liberia to evaluate the proposed establishment of a United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council called upon all parties to the conflict to respect and implement the cease-fire, to cooperate fully with the advance mission and to ensure the safety of all United Nations staff as well as all other peace-keeping and humanitarian personnel within Liberia. It commended the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for its efforts to restore peace, security and stability in Liberia.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, G. Baccus Matthews, said the successful implementation of the Cotonou Agreement would herald a new chapter in international cooperation for peace between the United Nations and a regional and subregional organization. The cease-fire was being fully observed. The parties were taking steps to transform themselves into a Liberian National Transitional Government, but their efforts would depend on the help of the United Nations within the next 30 days, at the same time that the disarmament process must start. He appealed to the Council to support the people of Liberia, who were ready to march together to a peaceful and democratic future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Statements were also made by the representatives of Benin, Nigeria, Djibouti, Morocco, Venezuela, China, Cape Verde, United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Russian Federation, Japan, Spain and the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Security Council meets this afternoon to consider the situation in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Before the Council is a further report from the Secretary-General regarding the United Nations role in implementing the Agreement signed by the Liberian parties in Cotonou, Benin, on 25 July, following peace talks held at Geneva from 10 to 17 July. In the report (document S/26200), the Secretary-General states his intention to commence planning for the dispatch to Liberia as soon as possible of an advance team of United Nations observers to monitor and verify provisions of the Agreement related to a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities. He also intends immediately to send a technical team to draw up detailed plans for the establishment of a United Nations observer mission there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Agreement provides that a cease-fire and the cessation of hostilities would take effect seven days from the date on which the Agreement was signed, that is on 1 August, says the report. The Cease-fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) would supervise and carry out the implementation of the Agreement, while monitoring and verification would be effected by the United Nations. To ensure against any violation of the cease-fire between 1 August and the arrival of the additional ECOMOG troops and the main body of United Nations observers, the parties agreed to establish a Joint Cease-fire Monitoring Committee, comprising representatives of the three Liberian parties -- the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO) -- as well as ECOMOG and the United Nations, which would also chair the Committee. The report adds that during the initial period, the United Nations has undertaken to consider dispatching 30 military observers to Liberia to participate in the work of the Joint Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The parties also agreed that there should be a single Liberian National Transition Government with legislative, executive and judicial branches, says the report. General and presidential elections are to take place within seven months from the signing of the Agreement. In response to a request by ECOWAS, the United Nations now stands ready to assist a reconstituted Electoral Commission in the organization and conduct of free and fair elections. The report stresses that the rapid expansion of humanitarian assistance activities throughout the country would be an essential component in implementing the Agreement, and states that a consolidated inter-agency appeal will be issued shortly outlining estimated requirements for Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the report, while it would be less than prudent to underestimate the remaining difficulties, the Agreement offers the hope that the violent and destructive civil war which has afflicted Liberia may at last be brought to an end.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also before the Council was a draft resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(document S/26259), the text of which reads as follows:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The Security Council,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Recalling its resolution 813 (1993) of 26 March 1993,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Welcoming the signing under the auspices of ECOWAS, on 25 July 1993, at Cotonou, Benin, of a Peace Agreement between the Interim Government of National Unity of Liberia (IGNU), the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), and the United Liberation Movement for Democracy (ULIMO) (S/26272),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Considering that the signing of the Peace Agreement constitutes a major achievement and an important contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Liberia and in this region of West Africa, and creates the opportunity to bring an end to the conflict,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General dated 3 August 1993 (S/26200),</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;1. Welcomes the decision of the Secretary-General to send a technical team to Liberia to gather and evaluate information relevant to the proposed establishment of a United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL);</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;2. Approves the dispatch to Liberia as soon as possible of an advance team of thirty military observers to participate in the work of the Joint Cease-fire Monitoring Committee, including in particular to monitor, investigate and report cease-fire violations in conjunction with the said Committee, the mandate of said team to expire within three months;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;3. Looks forward to the report of the Secretary- General on the proposed establishment of UNOMIL, including in particular a detailed estimate of the cost and scope of this operation, a time-frame for its implementation, the projected conclusion of this operation, how to ensure coordination between UNOMIL and the peace-keeping forces of ECOWAS and their respective roles and responsibilities;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;4. Calls upon all parties to the conflict to respect and implement the cease-fire provided for in the Peace Agreement and to cooperate fully with the advance mission and ensure the safety of all United Nations personnel and all other peace-keeping and humanitarian personnel within Liberia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;5. Urges the conclusion at the earliest possible stage of a status of mission agreement;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;6. Commends ECOWAS for its efforts to restore peace, security and stability in Liberia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;7. Commends the Organization of African Unity (OAU) for its efforts in support of the peace process in Liberia;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;8. Decides to remain actively seized of this matter.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President of the Council, MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">(United States), called the meeting to order at 4:40 p.m.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PRESIDENT said she had received letters from the representatives of Benin, Egypt, Liberia and Nigeria requesting to be invited to participate in the discussion. There being no objection she invited the representative of Liberia to take a seat at the Council table and the representatives of Benin, Egypt and Nigeria to take seat's at the side of the Council chamber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The PRESIDENT drew attention to the following</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">documents: further report of the Secretary-General on Liberia (document S/26200); text of a draft resolution (document S/26259); and letter dated 4 August from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Council (document S/26265). A letter dated 6 August from the Charge d'affaires ad interim of Benin addressed to the Secretary- General would be issued as (document S/26272).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> G. BACCUS MATTHEWS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liberia, said the Cotonou Agreement was a victory for the Liberian people. By agreeing on a process beginning with the cessation of hostilities and leading to disarmament and free and fair elections, Liberians had decided on how political change would be brought about in their country. The Agreement was also a victory for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations. The successful implementation of the Cotonou Agreement would herald a new chapter in international cooperation for peace between the United Nations and a regional and sub-regional organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since the signing of the Agreement, he said, the cease-fire was being fully observed. The parties were taking the steps to transform themselves into a Liberian National Transitional Government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The adoption of the draft resolution before the Council, and its implementation, would prove a significant milestone on the road to peace, he said. A crucial concern was whether the United Nations would help Liberia to install the Transitional Government within the next 30 days concomitant, as the Agreement required, with the beginning of the comprehensive disarmament of combatants. The ECOWAS had requested funds to enable some African countries to provide reinforcement for ECOMOG. Those additional troops were urgently needed for the disarmament process. He appealed to the Council to consider that request from ECOWAS so that those countries which had declared a willingness to commit troops could secure the necessary funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The peace process in Liberia was at a delicate stage, he went on. For three and a half years, war, death and desolation had been visited upon the Liberian people. Today, peace was within reach, and every effort must be exerted to implement the Cotonou Agreement without delays. He appealed to the Council to support the people of Liberia, who, with one accord, were ready to march together to a peaceful and democratic future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> GEORGES A. WHANNOU (Benin) said the signing of the Agreement had resulted from the cooperation of the parties which had been fostered by the efforts of the United Nations. The cease-fire and the holding of elections were critical elements of the Agreement. Its humanitarian aspects, including the return of displaced persons, was also crucial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Implementation of the Agreement would exemplify cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations. The integration of Liberia into the ECOWAS through the establishment of peace and security there would benefit the region as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IBRAHIM A. GAMBARI (Nigeria) said that not since the Yamoussokro IV Accord had there been any settlement as comprehensive and crucial to the search for final peace in Liberia as the Cotonou Agreement. It clearly deserved the support of all interested parties in Liberia, as well as the international community. The draft resolution should be adopted unanimously as it represented a significant step in the efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict which had persisted for several years. The draft resolution sought the implementation of the provisions of the Yamoussokro Accord which the ECOWAS countries and the parties to the conflict had long acknowledged as the best possible basis for creating lasting peace in Liberia. The setting up of a Joint Cease-Fire Monitoring Committee to be replaced subsequently by a United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) would go a long way in strengthening the peace process for which the States of the sub-region had an abiding commitment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the signing of the Cotonou agreement by all parties, Nigeria had no illusions that peace had dawned in Liberia, he cautioned. The international community must continue to exert its utmost efforts until peace was fully assured. With the active cooperation lately demonstrated between the United Nations, ECOWAS and the OAU, it had been possible to maintain close contact with all the parties involved in the crisis. In that situation, and with the determination of the Liberian people, there was hope for an end to the crisis. The international community and relevant agencies must not relent in their efforts to deliver humanitarian assistance to the needy and displaced people in Liberia who continued to suffer from the ravages of the civil war. The international community had a duty to continue to assist those people to rebuild their lives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ROBLE OLHAYE (Djibouti) said he attached great significance to the draft resolution before the Council and supported wholeheartedly the dispatch of the advance team of military observers called for, signaling the inception of formal United Nations involvement in the resolution of the bloody and tragic conflict in Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The presence of the United Nations in Liberia would serve to lend acutely needed assurance to all the parties of the willingness of the international community to become involved in a fair and equitable resolution. The agreement was framed as a cooperative exercise by ECOWAS/ECOMOG and the United Nations, mirroring the complementary role each had played thus far under the lead of ECOWAS. It would serve as a shining example of regional and international division of labour in the maintenance of international peace and security.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The war had exacted a terrible toll on the Liberian people, he said, and, in addition to establishing peace, every effort needed to be made to quickly raise the follow of humanitarian assistance. Conditions must also be set which would allow the thousands of refugees and displaced people to return to their homes. That would not effectively take place until there was a lifting of the tight economic sanctions imposed by ECOWAS. For that to happen, the United Nations observer mission needed to be in place, and the cease-fire and disarmament processes begun without obstruction. &quot;Clearly there is every incentive to move quickly&quot;, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He welcomed the further enlargement of ECOMOG by drawing on new troops from ECOWAS and other OAU countries outside the West African region, he said.  The United Nations observer force would provide critically needed credibility and transparency not only in cease-fire verification, but in the implementation of the encampment, disarmament and demobilization provisions of the Agreement. While ECOWAS and the United Nations had been instrumental in bringing the warring parties to the table, neither the United Nations nor ECOWAS had imposed a set of agreements on the parties. The peace plan was the product of the Liberians themselves, reflecting their earnest desire to halt the fighting. &quot;It would be a cynical shame, a tragedy, if it were the intention of anyone to use this accord as a distraction to buy time to consolidate or re-equip&quot;, he said. By removing the weapons, demobilizing the troops, and sealing the borders, Liberia should be in a position to begin preparations for voter registration, elections and a truly representative government. The United Nations needed to be on hand to assist in that worthy venture, which would begin with 30 military observers, which might perhaps act as a pace-setter for an international effort to assist the reconstruction of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MOHAMMED NACER BENJELLOUN-TOUIMI (Morocco) welcomed the signing of the Cotonou Agreement as a great contribution to resolving the conflict which had ravaged Liberia. He said the ECOWAS and United Nations efforts which had led to the Agreement's successful conclusion exemplified the principles embodied in Chapter VIII of the Charter. Such cooperation must continue to ensure successful implementation of the Agreement's provisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He further welcomed the Secretary-General's initiatives, including the dispatch of a technical team to Liberia and the establishment of a fund in support of countries contributing to the plan's implementation. Morocco fully supported the terms of the draft resolution and would vote in favour of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> DIEGO ARRIA (Venezuela) said only time would reveal the will of the Liberian parties to follow up the Cotonou Agreement, which had been a great international achievement. Reviewing the Agreement's provisions, he noted the political aspects including provisions for elections. Liberia's situation was promising, he said, but violations of human rights should not be disregarded, as they had reached a monstrous dimension.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He praised the role of ECOWAS and ECOMOG in Liberia. The modalities used in El Salvador regarding the Truth Commission could also be used in Liberia, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LI ZHAOXING (China) welcomed the signing of the Cotonou Agreement as a major contribution to the restoration of peace in Liberia and the sub-region of western Africa. The cease-fire achieved with the help of ECOWAS and the OAU and the beginning of the Agreement's implementation marked a good beginning in the peace process, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He went on to stress that the achievement of genuine and lasting peace in Liberia depended on the cooperation of the conflicting parties with the United Nations and ECOWAS. They must adopt practical and effective measures to fulfill their commitments and must strictly observe the peace Agreement, so as to ensure a successful general election and create conditions for national reconciliation. China would vote in favour of the draft resolution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was hoped that the Secretary-General would send the advance group of 30 military observers as soon as possible to facilitate the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africa and its people had great potential, he said. The people, after endless suffering caused by war, were striving to establish a peaceful environment, rebuild their homeland and develop their economy. Solving the conflict in Liberia would promote peace and stability in the subregion and in Africa as a whole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JOSE LUIS JESUS (Cape Verde) said the conflict in liberia had been a major concern for the countries of the subregion. It had caused thousands of deaths, destroyed the economy of the country and spawned a serious humanitarian and refugee situation. All those involved must now work decisively towards achieving peace and stability in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Cotonou Agreement was a turning-point in the process of finding a lasting peaceful solution, he said. The Council had created the conditions for a meaningful United Nations contribution to a negotiated solution of the Liberian conflict. The future role of the United Nations would be crucial to the effective implementation of the Liberian peace Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed UNOMIL seemed to be a sine qua non condition for the successful implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, he went on to say. The UNOMIL must be deployed in a timely manner. The timely dispatch of an advance team of 30 military observers to participate in the work of the Joint Cease-fire Monitoring Committee was also important. The Secretary-General should set up a trust fund to assist ECOMOG contributing countries and potential contributing countries to cope with expenses resulting from their peace- keeping role. All those in a position to do so should contribute to that fund.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Concern arose, he said, over the humanitarian situation in Liberia.  Every effort should be made to guarantee that all those in need had access to humanitarian assistance. He commended ECOWAS and the Secretary-General's Special Representative for their vital contribution to the successful conclusion of the Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The draft resolution was adopted unanimously as Council resolution 856 (1993)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> TOM RICHARDSON (United Kingdom), speaking after the vote, welcomed the Agreement reached at Cotonou on 25 July, and said the resolution just adopted was testimony to the efforts of ECOWAS to resolve a conflict that had claimed 150,000 lives, wrought terrible damage on Liberia and brought instability to its neighbours, such as Sierra Leone. He recalled, however, that previous agreements had failed to last. The new ingredients introduced this time were a clear determination of the parties to the conflict to end the tragedy inside Liberia and the willingness of the international community to provide active support to the peace process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The signature of the Cotonou Agreement was only the beginning, not the end, of the peace process, he said. All parties should seize the opportunity for peace and cooperate fully in its implementation. As a first step, it was vital that the cease-fire should hold. The United Kingdom was therefore pleased to support the dispatch of a group of 30 observers for the Cease-fire Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For that process to move further forward and proceed to elections, and a new government, he said, it was evident that the ECOWAS regional force, ECOMOG, would have a continued crucial role in maintaining internal security.  He strongly supported ECOMOG's efforts so far in very difficult circumstances. The proposals put forward at Cotonou to widen the circle of contributors, and to supplement ECOMOG with United Nations observers, were a valuable opportunity to build confidence. He looked forward to a report from the Secretary-General on how UNOMIL might best be deployed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ending of the conflict would reveal the full extent of the damage caused to Liberia, he said. However, it was already clear that the need for humanitarian relief and, in the longer term, for reconstruction, would be considerable. The United Kingdom would continue to provide humanitarian relief -- both bilaterally and through the European Community -- and looked forward to consulting with Community partners on Liberia's other needs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> JEAN-BERNARD MERIMEE (France) welcomed the signing of the Agreement which put an end to a deadly conflict and commended the ECOWAS, the OAU and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for their efforts. Such cooperation, he said, was the realization of the principles embodied in Chapter VIII of the Charter. The UNOMIL would be the first peace-keeping operation made up of troops of both the United Nations and a regional organization. The tasks and budgets of the two organizations must be strictly divided appropriately. The United Nations troops must be funded through assessed contributions, while the others must be supported by voluntary contributions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He expressed concern over obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid, especially the blockages occurring at the border between Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire, despite the call of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for free access. Access must be restored and a process must be established for verifying the humanitarian nature of the convoys, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Welcoming the Council's action, he said commensurate attention should be paid to an equally critical conflict -- the one in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> RONALDO MOTA SARDENBERG (Brazil) said the signing of the Cotonou Agreement constituted a major achievement and strengthened hopes for the complete end of the tragic civil strife afflicting that country. It was encouraging that the efforts made both by ECOWAS and by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General had met with a commitment of the warring factions to reach a settlement conducive to national conciliation and to the reconstruction of Liberia. The international community should cooperate with the humanitarian assistance efforts to be carried out by the United Nations and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), with a view to creating conditions for the smooth implementation of the peace Agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He commended ECOWAS for its untiring efforts under extremely difficult conditions towards the restoration of peace and stability in Liberia. He looked forward to receiving the report of the Secretary-General, in particular with regard to the parameters for the future cooperation between ECOWAS and the proposed United Nations military observer operation in Liberia. By ensuring greater efficiency in the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, such cooperation would serve as an example for future undertakings between the United Nations and other regional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YULIY M. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) welcomed the signing of the Agreement and called on the parties to adhere to its provisions. The contribution of ECOWAS to the peaceful settlement of the conflict demonstrated the ability of Africa to resolve its own problems. Dialogue was the most important element in achieving peace. His country stood ready to support the Agreement as well as future initiatives aimed at restoring peace in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> YOSHIO HATANO (Japan) stressed that the advance team of military observers must be dispatched as soon as possible. It would be critical to ensure close coordination between ECOWAS and the United Nations. The provision of humanitarian aid was a primary concern at the present stage.  Japan had made a recent contribution to relieving the plight of refugees from the Liberian conflict. It had done so in the firm belief that the achievement of lasting peace would depend on the restoration of the economic and social stability of Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANTONIO PEDAUYE (Spain) welcomed the signing of the Cotonou Agreement and the example provided of cooperation between regional organizations and the United Nations. He supported the dispatch of military observers as well as of a technical team to Liberia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He went on to say that the Council should remain vigilant as the situation in Liberia was delicate, and he appealed to all parties to contribute to a successful outcome of the process which had started in Cotonou.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speaking as her country's representative, Ms. ALBRIGHT (United States) welcomed the Council's decision to dispatch an advance team of monitors to Liberia to participate in the monitoring of the cease-fire. She noted that the cease-fire had taken effect on 1 August and urged that the advance team be sent as quickly as possible to reinforce the cease-fire and increase the confidence of the Liberian parties in the international monitoring effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> She appealed to the Liberian parties, and especially to the NPFL, to honour the commitment they had made in the Agreement to allow humanitarian relief deliveries to reach all areas of Liberia via the most direct route, including from Monrovia. According to international relief organizations, delays in the delivery of much-needed relief put thousands of displaced persons, especially in lower Bong county, at risk of starvation. In view of the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the interior of the country, she also urged the United Nations, on an urgent basis, to find some mechanism to allow cross-border relief shipments from Cote d'Ivoire and Guinea to resume until such time as the full observer contingent referred to in the peace agreement might arrive. She noted that the Secretary-General's report mentioned an ECOWAS request for the establishment of a United Nations trust fund in support of the expanded ECOMOG peace-keeping force needed to implement the peace agreement. She encouraged the Secretary-General to seriously consider setting up such a trust fund to facilitate the collection of international contributions to the ECOWAS/ECOMOG peace- keeping effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United States, she went on, had provided over $28 million to ECOWAS and its member States in the last three years in support of the ECOMOG peace-keeping operation in Liberia. It would continue to assist ECOMOG as it stepped up its activities to implement the Agreement and encouraged other members of the international community to do so as well. She appealed to the signatories to the Agreement to stand by the commitments made in it and to work with ECOWAS and the United Nations to implement it fairly and expeditiously so that the suffering of the Liberian people would end and reconciliation would begin.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BACKGROUND Aug 11, 1993 -- Fighting between the Armed Forces of the Government of Rwanda and the Rwandese Patriotic Front (RPF) first broke out in October 1990 across the border between Rwanda and its northern neighbour, Uganda. Despite a number of cease-fire agreements thereafter, hostilities resumed in the northern part of the country in early February 1993. These interrupted comprehensive negotiations between the Government of Rwanda and RPF, supported by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and facilitated by the United Republic of Tanzania.  In support of resumption of the negotiations, Rwanda and Uganda, in separate letters to the President of the Security Council on 22 February 1993, called for the deployment of United Nations military observers along the 150-kilometre common border in order to prevent the military use of the area, especially the transportation of military supplies. RPF control of the border has been extensive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Following consultations in the Security Council on 24 February concerning these letters, the Secretary-General decided to send a goodwill mission to Rwanda and Uganda. He instructed it to examine all major aspects of the peace process including the possibility of deploying military observers along the border. The goodwill mission carried out this mandate during 4-18 March 1993.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, efforts by OAU and Tanzania led to a meeting between the Government of Rwanda and RPF from 5 to 7 March at Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. In a closing joint communique, the Government of Rwanda and RPF pledged their commitment to a negotiated settlement and agreed to reinstate the cease-fire on 9 March and to the resumption of peace talks in Arusha, Tanzania. They also committed themselves to providing adequate security and protection to displaced persons.  On 12 March 1993, the Security Council, by its resolution 812 (1993), called on the Government of Rwanda and RPF to respect the renewed cease- fire, to resume negotiations, to allow the delivery of humanitarian supplies and the return of displaced persons, and to fulfil the obligations and commitments the parties had made in the past. The Council also welcomed the goodwill mission the Secretary-General had sent to Rwanda and Uganda. Finally, it asked him to examine the requests of those two countries for the deployment of observers along their common border.  Following the adoption of the Council resolution, the Secretary-General sent a technical mission to assess the concept of military observers. It visited Uganda from 2 to 5 April and Rwanda on 6 April. The mission reported that it would be possible to deploy United Nations military observers to monitor the border between Uganda and Rwanda and verify that no military assistance --lethal weapons, ammunition and other material of possible military use -- was being provided across it. It was decided that deployment of the observers would be on the Uganda side of the border only.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> SECURITY COUNCIL AUTHORIZES ESTABLISHMENT OF OBSERVER MISSION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 22 June 1993, the Security Council, by its resolution 846 (1993), authorized the establishment of the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda (UNOMUR) on the Uganda side of the common border, for an initial period of up to six months. The duration of the mission is subject to review, following the conclusion of the Arusha talks (see peace talks in arusha below). The Council decided that the verification would focus primarily on transit or transport, by roads or tracks which could accommodate vehicles, of lethal weapons and ammunition across the border, as well as any other material which could be of military use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Council requested the Secretary-General to conclude a status of mission agreement with the Government of Uganda which would include assurance of safety, cooperation and support of the Mission by Uganda. The authorized strength of UNOMUR is 81 military observers, 17 international and seven local civilian support staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UNOMUR is to be headed by Brigadier-General Romeo A. Dallaire of Canada as Chief Military Observer, reporting to the Secretary-General. All matters affecting the nature or the continued effective functioning of the mission would be referred to the Security Council for its decision.  The Council also welcomed the Secretary-General's decision to support the peace efforts of OAU by putting two military experts at its disposal to help expedite the deployment of OAU's neutral military observer group to Rwanda.  The Secretary-General was requested to report on the contribution the United Nations could make to assist OAU in implementing the peace agreement and to begin contingency planning in the event that the Council decided that such a contribution was needed.  The Secretary-General estimates that the cost of the Observer Mission would amount to some $8,500,000 for an initial six-month period. The costs of the Mission are to be met by the assessed contributions of United Nations Member States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PEACE TALKS IN ARUSHA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a related development, Mr. Macaire Pedanou, head of the United Nations goodwill mission remained in Tanzania to observe, on behalf of the Secretary-General, the Arusha talks on a comprehensive peace agreement between the Government of Rwanda and RPF. These had reconvened on 16 March 1993.  The talks cover military issues, refugees and displaced persons, and outstanding political matters, including the amendment of the constitution, as well as the duration of the transitional period. Early in the talks the parties also began to discuss an international neutral force to oversee the implementation of key aspects of the peace agreement and to create confidence during the transition period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a joint request to the Security Council from Arusha on 11 June, the two parties called on the United Nations to send a reconnaissance mission to Rwanda as speedily as possible. This mission would prepare for the quick deployment of a neutral international force as soon as the peace agreement under negotiation was signed. The request welcomed the decision made in consultations between the United Nations and OAU that the United Nations should assume responsibility for and command of such a force. The parties asked that the force should guarantee public security, especially for the delivery of humanitarian aid. It would also assist in searches for weapons caches, neutralization of armed bands, demining, civilian disarmament and the cessation of hostilities. The parties also requested that the international force oversee the demobilization of existing armed forces and of all aspects of the formation of the new National Army and National Gendarmerie.  On 4 August 1993, the Government of Rwanda and RPF signed the peace agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On 15 April 1993, the United Nations launched an inter-agency appeal for international assistance covering a period from April to December 1993 amounting to $78 million to meet the needs of over 900,000 war-displaced people, or approximately 13 per cent of the nation's population. The appeal was the result of a request by the President of Rwanda to the Secretary-General earlier in 1993 following a three-fold increase in the number of the displaced persons whose emergency needs had overwhelmed the local capacity to supply them.  Most of the displaced were living in and around 30 camps where serious malnutrition and disease were prevalent. The situation was exacerbated by Rwanda's already precarious economic condition, overpopulation and rapidly declining agricultural production.  An inter-agency mission, led by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA), was fielded between 18 and 25 March to prepare a consolidated appeal with all concerned United Nations agencies. The appeal presents priority emergency relief projects focusing on food, nutrition, health, water and sanitation, shelter and household items and education. The projects would be undertaken singly or jointly by the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Programme and DHA, in close collaboration with Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations.  Following the signing of the Kinihira agreement of 30 May 1993 between the Government of Rwanda and RPF on the return and the resettlement of the displaced persons to the demilitarized zone in northern Rwanda, an estimated 500,000 displaced people have returned home. These movements have led to the closing of several camps for the displaced and the emphasis of the humanitarian assistance efforts has shifted to meeting the needs of displaced returning home.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Farmer-to-Farmer Volunteer Program, administered by Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development and funded by the U.S.  Agency for International Development, is currently recruiting agricultural specialists of varied backgrounds to provide technical assistance to female farmers in West Africa.

Volunteers posted to these countries will work closely with local farmers, small business people, and host country organizations to share their expertise on agricultural topics including distribution and marketing, women cooperatives, fruit and vegetable preservation and storage, rice and cassava marketing, sesame production and marketing, aqua culture, curriculum development and cooperative management. Volunteer assignments range from three to six weeks and the ultimate goal of these assignments is to help host farmers improve family income and nutrition as well as to increase overall food production and distribution.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Food Programme NAIROBI, AUGUST 31, 1993 -- The World Food Programme today re- deployed the major part of its trucking fleet in Somalia to its emergency programme in Rwanda. The fleet, jointly operated by WFP and the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea, has completed most of its work in Somalia and is urgently needed in Rwanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thirty-two long-haul trucks and 25 trailers which arrived in Mombasa from Mogadishu on 16 August left Mombasa for Rwanda today with 564 metric tonnes of sugar and vegetable oil. They will be used to ferry some 6,000 tonnes of relief food per month from Kampala directly to people in displaced camps in Rwanda, including those in the demilitarized zone.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WFP fleet will provide greater flexibility and cost efficiency. To date, WFP has been using private trucks to deliver relief food from Kampala, but security constraints have prevented truckers from delivering relief food directly to areas like Ruhengeri. Instead, cargo has had to be transported to Kigali, where private Rwandan trucks hired by ICRC as well as ICRC's own trucks have taken over the delivery to regional centers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP recently reached an agreement with the Government of Rwanda to allow trucks arriving from Uganda and Tanzania to clear customs at two regional centers, instead of first stopping in Kigali. This agreement applies to both WFP's fleet and private trucks hired by the Programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to the WFP, using its own trucks will result in net savings in transport of about USD 150,000 per month. Extra handling and storage costs will also be saved by eliminating the need to stop in Kigali. Direct delivery to displaced people camps will ensure that beneficiaries receive emergency food supplies much quicker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This component of the WFP trucking fleet was originally re-deployed to Mogadishu in December 1992 from WFP's operations in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where for the last eight years, the Programme has run the largest UN relief transport fleet in the world, delivering more than 2.4 million tonnes of food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The decision to bring the trucks to Somalia in December 1992 was based on the urgent need for a reliable fleet for long-haul trucking of relief food to towns like Baidoa, Berdera and Huddour in the interior of Somalia. As part of the international humanitarian effort, the governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea consented to moving the trucks to Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that the situation in Somalia had shifted from emergency to rehabilitation and reconstruction, once more the government of Ethiopia met WFP's request to temporarily re- deploy the fleet to Rwanda as a sign of solidarity for the current international relief effort.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The remainder of the WFP fleet in Somalia, 17 trucks, will return to Eritrea in the near future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although the food pipeline to Rwanda has greatly improved in recent months, the food security of the estimated 900,000 displaced people remains of utmost concern. NGOs in some of the displaced people camps are reporting high rates of death caused by malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While WFP -- the food aid organization of the United Nations System -- has been taking extraordinary measures to deliver large amounts of relief food into Rwanda, the last few months have seen persistent problems in ensuring proper food distribution at the camp level. WFP, together with ICRC -- the agency responsible for the distribution of relief food -- continues to work closely with the government of Rwanda to resolve the issue of inflated beneficiary lists and diversion of food aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> During the height of the Rwanda emergency, which began in February 1993, WFP launched a massive airlift out of Entebbe, delivering more than 26,000 tonnes of food to Kigali. This helped avert a major catastrophe. This airlift was terminated in July when WFP negotiated the re-opening and use of the Katuna border crossing from Uganda, a faster and more direct route than the one that crossed through Tanzania. -30- For more information, contact Brenda Barton, regional</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Food Programme</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAPUTO, SEPTEMBER 1 --As the roads to Caia and Maringue in Sofala province have finally been opened to overland convoys, the World Food Programme has replaced two more costly airlifts in Mozambique. Peace means that the country's network of roads is being used again; not only food aid, but also traders and peasants who are resettling move along the rutted dirt roads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Last week, WFP sent three convoys from Beira to Caia carrying a total of 170 tonnes of food while the previous week another convoy took 65 tonnes of food from Beira to Maringue via Macossa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP is now doing only one airlift in Mozambique, delivering a monthly 15 tonnes for 1,000 people in isolated Casa Banana, at a cost of slightly under US$400 per tonne. Because road transport can cut delivery costs by at least two thirds, WFP is funding the repairs on the road from Gorongosa to Casa Banana. The airlift will be discontinued as soon as the road is opened.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sending food by road is a much cheaper alternative and allows us to use money for other purposes, such as rebuilding bridges and repairing roads.&quot; said Philip Clarke, WFP Director of Operations in Mozambique. &quot;The country's shattered infrastructure certainly needs all the help it can get.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Road access in Nampula and Niassa provinces is also improving, allowing more efficient food deliveries. In Zambezia province, WFP opened many roads that had been out of use since the mid-1980s. To deliver food, WFP has gotten trenches filled, bush cleared, logs removed and wooden bridges built, often with the spontaneous help of local people who wanted the food to get through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The road to Caia winds its way through Dondo and Inhaminga, a formerly important railway junction that was cut off from the outside world since 1986. The Dondo-Inhaminga leg was opened by WFP in January 1992, although the first WFP convoy found several unexploded antitank mines along this route.  WFP has been using the road Beira-Dondo-Inhaminga regularly while airlifting food supplies to Caia and waiting for the Inhaminga-Caia leg to be demined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP is now exploring the possibility of using Caia as a depot and starting point for food deliveries to localities along the Zambezi river.  With the rainy season approaching and roads becoming impassable, sending food upriver by boats and barges makes sense. To do this, the Zambezi must first be sounded and its river ports re-equipped.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From 2-29 August, the WFP Logistics Unit (UNILOG) delivered nearly 6,000 tonnes of food, mainly to other aid agencies or organizations that carry out the final distribution to needy people. These include the Mozambican Red Cross, World Vision, Food for the Hungry, UNHCR, DPCCN and Renamo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the height of the relief effort, in March 1993, before the good harvest came in, UNILOG was delivering 19,000 tonnes a month and five localities were served by airlifts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thanks to the combination of peace and good rains, there has been a dramatic drop in the amount of food aid needed in Mozambique. In 1992/93, because of drought and war, WFP was providing food for 3.8 million people.  This year, WFP estimates that 1.1 million displaced Mozambicans need food aid --and many only until the next harvest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All over the country, hundreds of thousands of peasants are resettling, opening &quot;machambas&quot; or plots, clearing bush, preparing the land, building mud-and-poles huts and growing their own food.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To the 1.1 million displaced should be added the 300,000 refugees who so far have returned spontaneously from Malawi and who also need food aid until they become self-sufficient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is expected that more refugees will return from neighbouring countries as the planting season (October/November) approaches, with an estimated 700,000 returnees back in the country by April 1994. To provide these people with food, WFP has signed agreements with UNHCR, the Mozambican Red Cross and World Vision, who will distribute WFP food in eight of Mozambique's ten provinces, where returnees are expected to arrive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because of the influx of returnees and because rural household food stocks are being consumed and the hungry season is setting in, the monthly emergency food needs are increasing in certain areas. WFP estimates that the monthly requirement will increase slowly from the current 28,000 tonnes up to a maximum of 34,000 tonnes during April 1994, just before the harvest, and then drop again, in comparison, monthly requirements were 45,000 tonnes in 1992 -30Director of Operations, Maputo; phone (258-1) 49 3217/18 - 49</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Food Programme August 25, 1993 -- As the tide has changed in Angola, so has the situation for its civilian population -- for the worse. War is hurting badly not only people displaced by war and those in besieged towns; it is also hurting the population in secure Government-held cities. Poor residents of Luanda, Lobito and Benguela are feeling the brunt of the war as very little food is available and only at painfully high prices. Malnutrition rates are increasing alarmingly, especially among children, to the point that Unicef is declaring a nutritional emergency (more than 10 percent of children with serious or acute malnutrition) in many areas of these towns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Interprovincial trade has collapsed; there is minimal commercial activity and very little food available in city markets. What is available is not accessible. With the kwanza worth NK 45,000 = US$1, a low-level government employee earns NK300,000 kwanzas a month, or about US$7. The official minimum monthly salary is NK120,000. A 50 kg bag of maize costs more than one million kwanzas; a 50kg bag of potatoes costs two million kwanzas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is not surprising to find in the &quot;bairros&quot; (neighborhoods) of Lobito extremely thin and hungry children, their bones sticking out underneath their rags. Paradoxically, displaced people in camps in major cities are better off than poor residents because a lot of NGOs and aid agencies are active in the camps.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is why WFP has redirected its policy of giving priority to food deliveries in rural areas, besieged towns and displaced people who are directly affected by war. It was thought that residents of the larger cities would have access to food in the markets. But inflation and the collapse of the marketing system have put food out of the reach of the poor and even of those earning salaries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For this reason, in Lobito and Benguela, WPF is now supporting soup kitchens for residents (see Lobito/Benguela for more information). In Luanda, WPF provides food for the operation of many NGOs and the Ministry of Social Affairs (MINARS) (see Luanda/Sumbe section).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The worsening situation is not confined to cities. Although information from rural areas is sketchy and there are large &quot;grey zones&quot; of which little is known, reports are filtering in. There are pockets of critical malnutrition along the border with Zambia. Brazzaville reports that refugees escaping from Cabinda suffer from severe malaria and serious malnutrition. In Mavinga and Jamba, local authorities report they have no chloroquine to treat malaria patients. Lack of vitamin A is most severs among children under five in peri- urban areas and in camps for displaced people.  The lack of salt is severe all over Angola, except in the coastal areas. Salt is precious in the central highlands or &quot;planalto&quot; and not only for cooking -- lack of iodine causes goitre and mental retardation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unicef has estimated that 4,000 children die every month -- a conservative estimate, said its head in Luanda last week. Of these deaths, 25 percent would be directly attributable to fighting. Also, according to Unicef, the mortality of under fives has jumped to 292 per live births -- the highest in the world. That rate had decreased to 173 per 1,000 live births during the time of peace up to the elections. It is estimated that some 250,000 children have become orphans or have lost contact with their parents.  The number of street children has risen dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> FOOD DELIVERIES</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although official WFP relief flight to inland destinations have not resumed, WFP is able to move a significant volume of food for needy people in municipalities along the coast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It should be noted that, although the Government controls thin slices of territory, those areas have the largest concentrations of people -- and they keep arriving into towns. Aid officials in Luanda estimate that the capital's population may well top 2.5 million by now; the overcrowding is obvious, with the attending unsanitary conditions in a city that has poor sewage and lacks water and electricity daily. A figure of 25 people per household is not unusual. The triad of Lobito, Benguela and Katumbela may have two million people, as tens of thousands have fled from Huambo, Gana and Cubal and from the northern road to Huambo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In August, WFP is distributing nearly 8,000 tonnes, enough to feed more than half a million people. Most of it is delivered by land but, since NGOs and MINARS began flying to inland destinations last week, more deliveries have been made by air. This allows for a substantial increase in deliveries to isolated cities. In just one week (23-27 August), WFP has provided 761 tonnes of food for the relief flights carried out by the Lutheran World Federation and MINARS to Luena, Saurimo and Malange. In the week of 16-21 August, Caritas and LWF flew WPF food to Luena, Saurimo, Dundo and Cabinda. Caritas is now undertaking an initial 12 flights to Uige, a city under Unita control. According to the bishop of Uige, his town receives</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">requests for food from three neighboring provinces: Uige, Bengo and Malange. To meet these needs, food will be trucked from Uige to N'dalatando, Negage and the west of Malange province.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although information about the Unita-held countryside in the North is poor, it seems safe to assume that the combination of land mines and no access to markets means rural people are surviving on subsistence agriculture -- with the hungry season setting in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Renewed fighting in the &quot;planalto&quot; is causing and will cause an influx of newly displaced people who will need assistance. WFP is considering several ways of doing this. One way is using the railway to Ganda, which is a much cheaper way of delivering food and could bring it at least halfway to Huambo. That entails repairing the railway and clearing it of mines. WFP plans to increase its monthly deliveries to 10,000 tonnes in September. Total stocks in-country as of 15 August are 22,040 tonnes. The Programme is replenishing its stocks and will have received an additional 63,000 tonnes by the end of September. Nine ships are calling on Lobito and Namibe until mid-September (when the hungry season is on), bringing food mostly donated by the U.S. and the EEC.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LUANDA/SUMBE/LUENA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Luanda, WFP provides food for MINARS and several NGOs, reaching nearly 29,000 beneficiaries every fortnight. These include orphans and street children, patients in hospitals, (including cholera patients), amputees and displaced persons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In Bengo province, WFP assistance includes, among others, food for the Caxito hospital and for and for two agricultural and tree-planting projects implemented by ADPP. WFP is providing food for 20,000 displaced in Dondo, distributed by World Vision, and for 14,200 displaced people from Cacuso who are assisted by Caritas and MINARS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The WPF base in Sumbe reports fortnightly distributions of 434 tonnes of food through MINARS, Caritas and APN, reaching nearly 30,000 people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luana is looking much better than in May. Unita forces have been pushed some 50K away from the city. People have been assigned land. LWF has provided seeds and agricultural tools, and both residents and displaced are planting. LWF has opened a centre to treat scabies and the government has sent two doctors for the hospital.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> LOBITO/BENGUELA</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both cities are swollen by tens of thousands of displaced people.  Katumbela airfield is closed to relief flights so WFP is using the airport at Lobito. There is little food available; if there are surpluses of food from the few plots around Lobito, traders prefer to send it to Luanda where food fetches higher prices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Through MINARS and NGOs such as Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, ORA, AAA and Caritas, WFP is providing food for nearly 100,000 people. This includes about 46,000 persons displaced by war (32,000 are scattered through the cities, the rest live in camps); nearly 10,000 disabled persons and amputees, 500 orphans, elderly people and patients live in hospitals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In addition, the soup kitchens recently opened in the poorest &quot;bairros&quot; of Lobito and Benguela reach 22,400 people. The kitchens are managed by NGOs and parishes or churches, and WFP requires some form of community involvement in their operation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> More kitchens are expected to open soon, reaching an additional 11,000 people in Lobito; 9,000 in Benguela, 3,000 in Catumbela; 4,350 in Anha do Norte and 4,400 in Biopio. The last two areas were recently visited by WFP Lobito, by land, for a needs assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This week, WFP will conduct an assessment mission to Cubal to evaluate needs and ways of delivering food to Caimbambo, Cubal and neighboring areas.  Since the government retook positions and towns all the way to Altos de Katumbela, lots of people who had fled to Caimbambo and Cubal are returning home spontaneously, without waiting for an organized move or for the areas to be declared safe. These people will need assistance, not only in food, but also in seeds and tools to prepare for the next planting season (October/November).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> WFP is also planning deliveries along the northern road to Huambo but first will run assessment missions to Boccio and neighboring areas. Already WFP has agreed with the NGO Accao Agraria Alemaa to distribute 336 tonnes of food every month to 24,000 displaced people from Bocoio and Balombo municipalities.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AUGUST 30, 1993 -- The National Executive Committee of the African National Congress met in full plenary over the weekend commencing Friday 27th until Sunday 29th August, 1993.  The meeting, chaired by our President, Comrade Nelson Mandela, received reports from the Negotiations Commission, a report on Preparations for the ANCUs Conference on Reconstruction and reviewed the Report of the Motsuenyane Commission, established by the ANC to investigate instances of human rights violations committed against persons detained by the ANCUs security organs while in exile.  The vacancies on the National Executive Committee, created by the deaths of Comrades O.R. Tambo and Chris Hani were also filled and two additional members were co-opted onto the National Executive Committee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report of the NECUs Negotiations Commission provided an overview of the various facets of the unfolding negotiations process at the World Trade Centre at Kempton Park, as well as the negotiations occurring at the local and regional level.  The NEC once again endorsed the agreed on election date of April 27, 1994, underscoring the need to ensure the continued inclusivity of the process and that the agreed election date was adhered to.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The meeting examined the draft interim constitution as well as draft legislation for the Independent Broadcasting Authority and the Transitional Executive Council.  The NEC expressed its satisfaction with the progress made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The emergence of a bloc of ultra right wing parties and groups, clustered around COSAG, and the role they have chosen to play in the negotiations was noted with concern by the meeting.  Despite the ANCUs efforts to accommodate and address the concerns of the Inkatha Freedom Party and its COSAG allies on the issue of regional boundaries and the powers of regional governments, the NEC noted that our efforts have not elicited a positive response.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In its review of violence, the NEC, while recognizing the multiple origins of such violence, nonetheless remains convinced that its primary source is a well-orchestrated conspiracy on the part of forces opposed to democratic change, assisted by elements in the organs of state security.  The NEC approved the ongoing and other initiatives being undertaken to secure a dialogue between the supporters of the ANC and the IFP at grassroots and undertook to extend its engagement with White ultra-right because of apprehensions about their future in a democratic political order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEC undertook an extensive review of the ANC's own preparations for the election campaign noting that despite the uneven performance among its fourteen regions, the plans were largely on track. The ANC's campaign will begin in earnest on the 8th January 1994, the eighty-second anniversary of the ANC, on which date the movement will unveil its manifesto.  Preparations have now entered their second phase, during which campaigning structures will seek to contact every potential voter at least once in order to gauge our current electoral support. A number of regions have already begun applying new and creative forms of popularizing the elections and engaging in voter education such as the mock elections conducted in Port Elizabeth over the past weekend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEC received reports on the initiative to bring peace to Angola.  Given the historic responsibility of the Pretoria regime for the escalation of this conflict and the assistance Angola had given to the struggle for freedom in the sub-continent, it was resolved that the ANC do all in its power to bring an end to the fighting that has resulted in extensive loss of life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The threat of violence and its potential for disrupting democratic elections was identified as the gravest danger facing the country.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The NEC reviewed the report of the Motsuenyane Commission and has expressed its considered view on the matters therein in a separate statement which we are distributing today.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">AFRICA DEMOS, Volume 3, No.2, July-August 1993 In previous issues of AFRICA DEMOS, as well as in other publications, I have complained about the lack of a bold and comprehensive commitment of the United States government to the cause of democracy, human rights and civil liberties in Africa. As recently as April 22 during a hearing of the Subcommittee on Africa of the U.S. House of Representatives, I called the group's attention to the major commitments, in word and deed, already made to democratization in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe compared to the inadequacy of what was being said and done for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It must now be acknowledged that senior spokespersons of the U.S.  government have clearly demonstrated that this double standard is over. In his prepared statement for the same hearings, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, George Moose, announced his government's determination &quot;to help Africans build stable, honest, and democratic governments which respect fully human rights.&quot; He acknowledged the increasing number of countries that had conducted multiparty elections in recent years and those that were preparing them. &quot;Elections by themselves do not democracies make. The process leading to elections must allow for freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly, with full access to the media for all participants.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I therefore was pleased to acknowledge, when it became my turn to testify, that I never heard such forthright and unambiguous support for democratization in Africa by any senior U.S. official. I delighted in repeating to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">committee the words of Assistant Secretary Moose: &quot;We will not allow our assistance to be used for the support of dictators, and we will use the full weight of our influence to end dictatorial practices.&quot; Less than two weeks later, another senior official articulated the Africa policies of the Clinton administration. At a luncheon forum at the Brookings Institution, Washington, DC, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake declared that &quot;the most important change for Africa's long-term prospects is the continent's new progress toward democracy.&quot; He also acknowledged the number of African countries that had conducted multiparty elections. Yet, he</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">counseled: &quot;Africa's democratic institutions will not always look like our own, nor should they.&quot; From his remarks it was</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">clear that the time of coddling African autocrats was over: &quot;The African people have been saying that any ruling elite that puts its interests before those of the vast majority is no longer acceptable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Later in May, at the annual meeting of the African- American Institute (AAI), also in Washington, the depth and breadth of the new U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights and sustainable development in Africa were reflected in the presentations of Ambassador Moose, Administrator J. Brian Atwood of the United States Agency for International Development, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Mr. Atwood is well known to African democratic activists, and also to autocratic leaders, from his years of service as president of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDI). NDI has played a pioneering role in helping lay the basis for democratic polities in many African countries through its work in civic education, institution building, and election monitoring. Mr. Atwood brings a level of understanding about the democratic challenge in Africa to policy-making in the U.S. government that is unique. He acknowledged that &quot;there was a conspiracy of silence with the respect to what was going on in Africa. There was no one who really wanted to talk about human rights abuses in Africa.&quot; Some of Mr. Atwood's reflections deserve full citation, such as the following offered in response to individuals &quot;who</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">suggest that democracy cannot take place in Africa&quot;:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I would suggest that democracy took root in Africa long before it took in Europe. When people would go into those polling places at a national level, as opposed to conducting their democracy at the village level as they had done for centuries, they expected that their vote would count. They did not want, nor did they have any right to expect, that their government would steal their vote from them. So the outrage that people have felt in places like Kenya and Cameroon and Senegal most recently is very real outrage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Just days before the conference, the U.S. government announced its recognition of the government of Angola, acknowledging the good faith of the Dos Santos regime in conducting multiparty elections last September. In a sweeping statement in which he indicated U.S. concerns for the mediation of conflicts, the promotion of human rights, public health and debt reduction in Africa, Secretary of State Christopher admitted a point that critics of U.S.  foreign</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">policy had long made: &quot;During the Cold War period, policies toward Africa were often determined not by how they affected Africa but by whether they brought advantage or disadvantage to Washington or Moscow.&quot; In several policy domains, he promised that &quot;the Clinton administration will make Africa a high priority and give it the attention it deserves.&quot; Moreover, as a symbol of the new policy, President Sam Nujoma of a democratic Namibia was invited to be the first African head of state to be received in the Clinton White House. Unfortunately, some African leaders do not appear to have taken seriously this &quot;wind of change&quot; in American foreign policy. When Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida unfolded the latest series of judicial and administrative actions intended to confuse and delay the democratic transition in Nigeria, he provoked an</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">immediate rebuke from the State Department: &quot;The United States deplores the outrageous decision of Nigeria's military regime to annul the results of the June 12 presidential election and cancel the transition to elected civilian rule.&quot; The June 22 statement went on to condemn &quot;the continuing repression of the press and democratic forces&quot; in Nigeria and &quot;the failure on the part of the military regime to respect the will of the Nigerian people and transition to democracy.&quot; Despite the U.S. government's reliance on imports of Nigerian crude oil, and its carefully nurtured improvements in relations since the chill of the mid-1970s, the Clinton administration was not prepared to disguise its profound disappointment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each of the previous statements by U.S. officials recognizes that more than the introduction of formal institutions of constitutional democracy is needed in Africa. Almost every African country must rebuild weakened economies permit civil society to flourish anew, and allow democratic norms and practices to become established. A genuine commitment to assist democracies in Africa is a long-term one and comes with a pricetag. In recognizing its responsibilities, the United States is taking the first step to acknowledge its deep and historic ties to the African people and their continent. It also poses a challenge to other major powers who have been content to proffer mere rhetoric, or adopt the old &quot;conspiracy of silence,&quot; when confronted by the struggle between the democratic renewal and autocratic resistance in Africa. -30- AFRICA DEMOS is published by the African Governance Program at The Carter Center of Emory University (CCEU), One Copenhill, Atlanta, GA 30307 USA; (404) 420-5151.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> M.K.O. Abiola reacts to President Ibrahim BabangidaUs address to the National Assembly, August 17, at an interview</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">with NEWSWATCH London bureau chief, Kayode Soyinka:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: In his speech to the National Assembly, President Babangida did not give a clear indication on the political future of the country. Are you disappointed?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: He is playing the waiting game. He wished he could hang on. He wished because he is that type of a person. He is a gambler. He gambles with the hopes and aspirations and the future of the Nigerian people.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH What is he up to?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: He is bribing the National Assembly legislators so that they could come and beg him. That was what he called Anenih &amp; Co. for, to come and beg him and he would then turn round and tell Nigerians that he had made up his mind to relinquish power, that he had said he was going, but that the legislators and politicians like Anenih were the ones who appealed to him not to go, that he should stay on as president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: What do you think will now happen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: He is counting on the legislators to now debate his speech, after which, he hopes, they would now vote to ask him to stay in power.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: What should Nigerians who voted for you in the June 12 election do?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: Nigerians should just stay calm and stay the course of democracy and the election of June 12. Babangida has not been able to convince the world that there was anything wrong with that election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Could you still be president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: Oh yes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Why are you so sure?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: Because I know the Nigerian army. The Nigerian army is not loyal to one man. Nigerian army is loyal to the nation. Their oath of office is to the country. And theyUve told him that his term expires on August 27.  He is like a child dancing round the well, he dares not jump inside the well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: But Babangida is bent on installing an interim government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: Whoever he likes he can hand over to. He is wasting time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Your critics said you should have taken part in the three-day strike called by the Campaign for Democracy last week instead of travelling abroad canvassing international support?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: That is their own judgment. Nobody claps with one hand, not even in Nigeria. I succeeded in the elections. And in my success I had only one vote, the other millions of votes were contributed by fellow Nigerians. I am not the only custodian of liberty and democracy in Nigeria, there are others. I decided to come and tell my own story to the world in the name of the African people, in the name of the Nigerian people. And that is more important really.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Are you not worried that while you are outside your support in Nigeria might be weakening?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIOLA: My support in Nigeria was not built overnight. It cannot disappear overnight either. It is not a building built with my saliva that will disappear under the morning dew, no. I have been a true Nigerian for the last 25 years, giving scholarships, giving employment, developing various areas far flung away from my own locality. That is not done overnight. I have 235 traditional titles throughout Nigeria. All that cannot be withdrawn in any case. Democracy is not a one manUs cup of tea. -END -30- Reprinted from NEWSWATCH, August 30, 1993</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;A major feature of your life so far is the doggedness and determination with which you pursue any venture embarked upon.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- President Ibrahim Babangida in a birthday message to Abiola in 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola is no stranger to battles. His life is a story of personal battles that have turned the impoverished boy who roamed the streets of Abeokuta into a man of immense wealth and global influence. But since June 23, Abiola seems to be locked in the fiercest battle of his life. President Ibrahim Babangida's annulment of the June 12 presidential election which Abiola is believed to have won, has brought out the warrior in him. Abiola has consistently maintained his rejection of the annulment and his determination to keep faith with August 27, the date the military promised to relinquish power.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He sounded his battle cry June 24 when he declared himself the &quot;custodian of a sacred mandate,&quot; which he would not relinquish. &quot;on that date (August 27), the people of Nigeria through their democratic expressions of June 12, 1993 expect me to assume the reigns of government. I fully intend to keep that date with history.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How Abiola intends to do that, no one can say. However, his declaration has pitched him against Babangida, his bosom friend and his military regime and even a number of politicians across the country. Within his party, the SDP, a deep crack has surfaced. Support for him is no longer total. Abiola, abroad since August 4, to canvass international support for his campaign to get the Babangida regime to uphold the result of June 12 election, plans to return home this week. He will certainly meet a party in rancour and torment. His publications, the Concord newspapers and magazines and other sympathetic papers have been proscribed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the government news media, he is portrayed as the unpatriotic one who has been abroad campaigning against his country; the rich politician who has refused to play by the rule and who has promoted selfish interest above nationalist interest. When government officials speak of the &quot;rich persons who are not necessarily the philosopher kings,&quot; the meaning is not lost on Nigerians.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> His trip abroad has been branded as illegal and a violation of the country's civil aviation laws, an offense which attracts severe penalty. No doubt, the odds are against Abiola. But Abiola is a man at home with the odds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When he entered the race for the presidency in January, he stood no chance of clinching the party's ticket. He was a stranger to the fold. A co-contender at the time described him as &quot;not only a stranger but inexperienced in party politics.&quot; Ten years earlier, these same reasons forced him to quit the banned National Party of Nigeria, NPN. First, when he contested the party's national chairmanship against Adisa Akinloye in 1980, he was outschemed by the more experienced politicians. He lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Then on June 12, 1982, Abiola set his eyes on succeeding Shehu Shagari as the NPN flag bearer. He could not obtain the nomination form because the party secretariat's doors were shut against him. In frustration, he resigned from the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Umaru Dikko, Shagari's powerful transport minister, told him: &quot;The presidency is not for sale to the highest bidder.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> June 12 must have a mystical power over Abiola. On June 12, 1982, he could not even run the race. On June 12, 1993, he ran but was stopped before breaking the tape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He feels cheated. He has declared that the road to peace in the country lies in a recourse by Babangida to the path of natural justice. His last press statement issued before he took off for London stated this much.  &quot;As the direct beneficiary of the (June 12) mandate, I stand firm and resolute in upholding and defending that mandate. I shall never compromise or betray the trust reposed in me by the Nigerian people.&quot; That statement, like previous ones, reflect the combative nature of the man. In an interview with NEWSWATCH in 1988, Abiola explained this attitude by saying, &quot;we do everything we have to do with all the means at our command.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since he arrived London without a formal visa, Abiola has become some kind of a folk hero. He has enjoyed extensive coverage by the western media.  He is a constant guest of the British Broadcasting Corporation, BBC. He has appeared twice on the American Cable News Network, CNN. His first appearance, which took place in Washington, DC was heavily promoted and Abiola was introduced as &quot;the man who will be president in Nigeria.&quot; He held consultation with key political leaders in the United States Congress and government including Al Gore, the vice-president whom he met within 24 hours of his arrival in the US. The 90 minutes meeting is believed to have been attended briefly by Bill Clinton's chief of staff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the United Kingdom, Abiola has met with parliamentary, opposition and key government officials. His</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">message: Tougher action against Nigeria to force Babangida to respect the people's mandate. In the days ahead, the success or failure of his campaign will be seen in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Abiola, the road to the present has been tough and bumpy. Only last November, he had declared his aversion for partisan politics. &quot;Why should I join any of the two political parties? If I join the SDP, I will be estranging my numerous friends in the NRC. That is the problem with being partisan. Count me out of any partisan arrangement like joining any political party.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six weeks later he changed his mind and registered with the SDP, declaring himself a social democrat. The day after, he obtained the party's presidential nomination form. He was able to beat formidable forces like Baba Gana Kingibe, his running mate, to clinch the tickets. Abiola relishes controversy the way he loves proverbs. His campaign was marked by a few, especially his choice of Kingibe, a muslim as his running mate. It angered not only members of the Yar'Adua group whose support led to the defeat of Kingibe but a number of sympathetic Christians. Kingibe had even referred to him as &quot;one of those sitting on the fence while we labored to build the party but has now come to reap from our sweat.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interim national government announced by Babangida last week may have pulled the rug from under Abiola's feet. His party supports the new arrangement. The new government takes over from the transitional council on August 25, two days before the August 27 date originally fixed for the disengagement of the military from government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He told NEWSWATCH in London August 18 that he will still take over as president August 27. It remains to be seen how he will accomplish this. -30- Reprinted from NEWSWATCH, August 30, 1993</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast -- Nigeria's new interim civilian government says it plans to withdraw its troops from the West African peace-keeping force in Liberia because it can no longer afford to keep them there.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The plan comes at a critical time in Liberia, where a cease-fire has held for a month but disarmament of the country's young and undisciplined fighters has yet to begin. Three and a half years of fighting has left more than 150,000 people dead.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigerian forces and ammunition drive the six-nation West African peace-keeping operation in Liberia. The peace-keepers were drawn into the war last October when rebels attacked the capital Monrovia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria's new head of state, Ernest Shonekan, said in a national address Tuesday that it was ''time to bring the boys home'' and they should all return to Nigeria by the time he leaves office next March. He said he would discuss the plan with fellow members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) that created the peace-keeping force and sent it to Liberia in August 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shonekan, a businessman and political newcomer, was appointed last week by outgoing military president Ibrahim Babangida and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He is Nigeria's first civilian leader in a decade.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Africans have long looked to Nigeria as the giant of the sub-Saharan region because of its vast oil wealth and record for assisting its less fortunate neighbors. But now it is struggling under a $30-billion foreign debt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''There is no doubt that our economy has suffered because of our peace-keeping and peace-enforcing operations,'' said Shonekan. The United States has helped finance Nigeria's involvement in Liberia, a nation settled by freed American slaves in 1847, by contributing $28 million to ECOWAS.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Shonekan said Liberia no longer needed Nigerian troops and put the burden on the United Nations, which has its own financial problems, and the international community to see disarmament through. Up to 4,000 additional non-West African peace-keeping troops from Tanzania, Zambia, Egypt and Zimbabwe are expected to arrive in Liberia within the next two months to assist with disarmament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Liberia's three warring factions signed a peace accord in July that led to the formation of a new transitional government. Its first meeting has already been boycotted by rebel leader Charles Taylor's representative because of a dispute over when the new government would take office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Taylor, who began the war when he invaded from the Ivory Coast on Christmas Eve 1989, has persistently accused the West African troops, especially the Nigerians, of siding against him and of trying to take over Liberia. Babangida was friends with Samuel Doe, the Liberian president who was abducted from West African troops by a splinter rebel group and killed in September 1990.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Foreign observers had speculated that Taylor decided to give up fighting the 11,000-strong West African force when it appeared as if the military would remain in power in Nigeria after Babangida annulled June's presidential elections. He appointed Shonekan following intense pressure at home and abroad to install a democratically elected president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The pressure has not eased. A strike by Nigeria's largest labor union has held for six days to press for the appointment of Moshood Abiola as president. He is widely believed to have won the June 12 polls that Babangida annulled because of alleged fraud. International monitors judged the vote fair.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast - The Central African Republic's military leader Andre Kolingba has lost presidential primaries, ending his 12-year-rule, and set free a former president imprisoned for murder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kolingba freed Jean-Bedel Bokassa on Wednesday along with the rest of the nation's prisoners to commemorate his 12th anniversary in power. Bokassa was jailed in 1987 on charges of embezzlement, murder and cannibalism.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He is barred from entering politics, but told the French daily LE FIGARO in an interview published Thursday that he would return to power if he had popular support.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''I will do everything I can to help my country,'' Bokassa told the newspaper. ''If I am asked to return to politics, I will see. If the people want it, I will return.'' He has moved to an apartment in the presidential palace, a big change from solitary confinement. ''This is my place. I am emperor,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Several hundred of his supporters in the capital Bangui on Wednesday cheered his release. Some reports said they were trying raise $20,000 for a registration fee to put Bokassa up as a candidate in the second round of presidential elections scheduled for Sept. 12.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kolingba finished fourth in the first round of voting on Aug. 22 with 12 percent. The first woman to have participated in a presidential election in sub-Saharan Africa, Ruth Rolland, came in last with one percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kolingba tried to change the electoral law after it became apparent that he was losing. But France, the nation's former colonial ruler, immediately condemned the move and suspended all bilateral aid. Kolingba quickly backed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The top two finishers, Agne-Felix Patasse and Abel Goumba will compete in the runoff. They won 37 percent and 22 percent respectively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Patasse was a prime minister under Bokassa before the self-declared emperor was deposed with French assistance in 1979. Bokassa, 72, seized power in a coup in 1965 and his 14- year rule was often compared to the brutal regime of Uganda's Idi Amin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Bokassa was sentenced to death in 1987 after he returned from exile in France and Cote d'Ivoire. Kolingba commuted his sentence to 20 years and later to 10 years. -30NIGERIA TO PULL OUT OF PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN LIBERIA</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a mood bordering on euphoria around the prospects of the elections scheduled for next April in the ranks of the democracy movement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Throughout the country people are working feverishly in garnering support for their parties and will soon see a dramatic reversal of roles; when former prisoners and political activists assume important positions in government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If this is a scene that is full of hope, it also has the makings of a potential tragedy if the key components of the movement are not vigilant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For a start there may be the danger of the ANC collapsing into becoming an election machine when the times call for a strong organisation for the task of changing the conditions that affect the majority, which is poor.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Too often in Africa, the reversal of political roles has tended to end at leadership level and never filtered down to the mass of the people. And thus the lot of the people's lives was not affected by the changes whereas that of the elite did change and rather dramatically.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This chasm between the elite and the mass of the people then creates conditions of great tension and that invariably leads to terrible suppression by the new rulers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This denial of civil liberties against the majority then creates conditions wherein the elite plunder the country's resources at will and by the time a creditable, leadership emerges, the economy is already in ruins.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the cycle that has led to the interventions of institutions such as the IMF in many developing countries and often such interventions unravel in tandem with a political agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now while it is true that having the vote will be an important advance in the path to democracy the vote in itself is quite worthless if it does not lead to the establishment of new and better conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The vote can be an important tool in the hands of the majority in bringing about social change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The question that needs to be asked is what should be done to ensure that our vote counts -- not simply in putting our preferred political formation in power, but in ensuring that those who are in power are accountable to the people who elected them?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Conditions in South Africa are going to get worse before they get better.  The majority will have the vote but will not have employment or housing. DILEMMA OF ELECTION</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenges that confront the country cannot be resolved by a new government alone, but will require the active participation of all organs of civil society.  This is why building organisation will help bring about accountability, but will also mean that the structures and energies from the communities are used constructively.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> People's expectations are high -- so high in fact that if they are not met the country could be thrown into a cataclysm of violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This is the unenviable task of government of national unity that will be elected next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dilemma of democracies in modern time is that the exercise of the highest democratic right, that of voting, is periodic through the holding of elections and is followed by a lull until the next elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This has tended to reduce political parties into election machines that splutter to life every other four or five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the context of the South African experience the building of strong organisation is going to be the key to sustaining our democratic rights. It is only through strong collective power that the majority can help democracy prosper.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It may be that we have already fallen into the first trap of allowing the mood of optimism to demobilise the democratic forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when the new conditions demands vision, self examination and rigorous debate, intellectual paralysis has set in.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet this is understandable if one considers that many of our leading intellectuals and activists are suffering from a &quot;war weariness&quot; of the past couple of years. But if we say negotiations are site of struggle, we have to recognise that rebuilding the country is an even higher stage of struggle that requires our collective energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mass media could be a powerful instrument in empowering people in their first experience of democracy and in acting as a collective mobiliser and a transporter of experience.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But to be able to perform its function properly, South African mass media needs a new framework from within which to work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And a key element in the development of the new framework must be a commitment by media owners that under these circumstances the interests of democracy are more important than the interests of shareholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly the fact that a new Independent Broadcasting Authority will soon be in place means that the airwaves can be used more effectively in building democratic culture.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">While many African nations are still floundering with antiquated and unreliable telecommunication systems, Botswana is on schedule to complete its country-wide digital microwave link late this year. Diamond-rich Botswana's huge foreign currency reserves have enabled it to fund a modern telecommunications network.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The service, is the most modern in Africa, has been developed over the past six years by UK firm Cable and Wireless with the Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC). Cable and Wireless has also been involved in telecommunications in Nigeria and Cameroon.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When construction is completed on the final digital microwave links between Ghanzi on the western edge of the Kalahari Desert and Jwaneng in the south ; and Maun in the north and Orapa on the eastern side of the Kalahari; the backbone telecommunications infrastructure for Botswana will have been completed, providing basic telephone services to the major population centres. Along the way, many villages have been provided with their first-ever telephones. BTC aims to provide services (at least one payphone and a limited number of lines for police, medical clinic and other essential services) to all villages with populations over 500.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The majority of the telecommunications development work during the early years from 1986 was concentrated on the major population centres along the eastern side of Botswana. This provided the economic base to finance expansion into remote areas. BTC commercial manager Richard Doyle said the vastness of the country and low population densities coupled with the wide spacing of settlements had presented the major hurdles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The digital microwave backbone, which circles the country, is solar powered. It is by far the largest in Africa (and one of the largest in the world) with a total transmission distance of more than 2000 kilometres. The microwave towers are being installed by Norwegian firm ABB Nera. One tower is erected every 40 kilometres along the route to provide line-of-side communications. The solar power panels provide the main power source and have the capacity to take 2000 simultaneous calls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The speed at which the new system installed has forced user costs up, although Doyle claimed Botswana's telecommunication charges were not the most expensive in Africa and were cheaper than some European countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have n trying to link up the whole country in two years and at t same time have had to run the operation a sound commercial basis,&quot; said Doyle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;In six years we have gone from having between 5000 and 6000 lines on a manual exchange to having the digital microwave link around the country almost completed, as well as installing 400 circuits into South Africa and satellite communications for international calls.&quot; A local call costs 21 thebe for six minutes.&quot; With the backbone links near completion BTC is now looking to enhance its services to meet the expanding needs of the business community. In June last year a new data communications service was introduced - the Botspac Packet Switched Data Service. Users have a wide choice of speeds at which they can access the networks and they do not need to know the access speed of the destination terminal as the system will authomatically convert the original speed of a call to the speed of the receiving terminal.  Access to Botspac PSS is by standard direct circuit or by a dial-up telephone line. The data links are direct, permanently- available connections to the network and subscribers have a choice of either synchronous (packet mode) or asynchronous (character mode) connections. They are available at transmission speeds ranging from 1200 bps to 65,000 bps.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The dial-up connection is through the public switched telephone network and is normally used for direct data transmission from a terminal to a host commuter. A modem and accompanying software are required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The service has 20 corporate subscribers to date. The quality of the data exchange, the cost and the ability to network have been the major selling points. Barclays Bank uses Botspac for its business master services for corporate clients. The clients can call in and access their own data base in the Barclays network. In May, 1992, the country's first paging service came on line in Gaborone providing coverage within 35 kilometre radius of the capital. The service has been extended to Francistown and BTC is now looking offering the service to other towns. Cellular mobile telephones, carphones and pocket phones are still waiting government approval. Doyle said the government had put the idea of mobile phones on hold while it looked at the possibility of liberalising the market.; at the moment the BTC has a monopoly. Providing satellite links for mobile phones is not considered economically viable yet because of the size of the country and the limited number of potential customers.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Sunday Nation travels to the refugee camps of Gazankulu to speak to Mozambican refugees who are still fleeing their country, even though the war between the Renamo rebels and the Frelimo government is over.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Thick smoke hangs in the air over the Hluphekani village east of Gazankulu's capital, Giyani. Small traditional huts are crammed together on bare dusty earth. Radios blare out songs in Shangaan and Portuguese.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hluphekani, which means suffering in Shangaan, is home to hundreds of refugees who have fled war-torn Mozambique to a better life in South Africa.  Now, hunger and starvation have added to the exodus.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the refugees share a common dream of going back home once they feel it is safe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Sunday Nation team, which visited the village to find out how the refugees were faring, called at the only relief centre for the 2,000 inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The centre is run jointly by Gazankulu homeland and the South African Red Cross, which provides blankets and soap. It has five workers, including clerks and security guards. On the floor is a heap of mealie meal to meet the needs of new arrivals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other donors include Operation Hunger, which provides soup, mealie meal and bread. Next to the centre is a clinic which was built by Gazankulu's Department of Social Welfare. The clinic is staffed by three qualified nurses and a welfare worker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As we drove through the village, we saw men and women erecting makeshift huts to accommodate fresh refugees fleeing poverty in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the ceasefire agreement signed between Renamo and the ruling Frelimo government, refugees are still pouring into Gazankulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lacio Sambo, a teenager, and an elderly man, Samson Sithole, are new arrivals at the camp. Neither knows what the future holds for them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They left war-ravaged Mozambique knowing that the South African sponsored Renamo rebels and the Frelimo government had smoked a peace pipe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Sithole and Sambo said life was still extremely difficult in the rural areas of Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sambo, wearing a thick khaki jacket and matching shorts, does not know his age but remembers vividly that poverty forced him to leave his village.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He struggled to control tears rolling down his face</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and said:&quot;All I want is to start a new life here. I left Mozambique and walked through the forest for many days.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm glad the war is over, but there's nothing to live for in Mozambique. I'm hungry and looking for a job. I'm prepared to do any work because I'm suffering.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Communications between Sambo's village of Khombomuni in the Gaza district and the capital, Maputo, are completely cut off.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government lorries, which used to deliver food rations, cannot travel because the roads are still not safe. Sambo said when the sun rose each morning, the villagers would look for the trucks - but their hopes would turn to despair when the sun set.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Livestock like goats and cattle were confiscated by the rebels - drought killed off the rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rebels would come to our village and kill people without saying anything. Those of us who were lucky would run into the bush and hide until they had left,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Sometimes we would stay in the bush for many days, eating wild berries, roots and tree leaves. The elders would send a young boy back to the village to see if it was safe to go back.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sithole still cannot believe he survived the war. Although he does not know his age, he looks old enough to be a pensioner. His weary legs carried him through the rough countryside between Maputo and Gazankulu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He risked his life crossing the paths of lions, elephants, hyenas and jackals and found his way to &quot;safe&quot; South Africa without interference from the police.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> HUNGER</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I came here because of hunger. I'm old but I think I can still work for a year or two. There's not much left for me in this world because I've seen enough horror in my life,&quot; Sithole said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Back home, there's nothing to live for. The rebels would come to our village and take all the food and livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Most of us are fortunate just to be alive today. We were left with nothing and there was nothing we could do because the rebels were always ready to kill those who opposed them. The situation was bad and I decided to walk all the way to Gazankulu,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees spend the day wandering around the village, waiting for Good Samaritans from Giyani township and white farmers from Mooeketsi and adjoining farms to give them work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Johannes Mashava, 40, is among the few refugees fortunate enough to be employed at the camp. He is a security guard earning R160 a month. BURNED</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The rebels came to our village one night and shot at people. They burned down our huts, raped women and took our cattle,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mashava is looking forward to the day when peace is restored in Mozambique so that he can go back home with his family. He doubts, however that it is safe to return at this stage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I've heard that the war is over and I'm longing to go back. I'm always thinking about that because people who go home also tell us that the war is over.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We found George Khoza sipping traditional beer brewed by one of his four wives, who managed to escape with him. A sobbing Khoza refused to be photographed but talked openly about his experiences.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Don't ask me about my children because most of them were killed by the rebels,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Those people (Renamo) would attack at night and everyone would run for their lives and hide in the mountains until the next morning. But we also want to go home.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Barefooted Zephania Sambo said he could not remember his age only that he was &quot;very old&quot; and had known better times in Mozambique.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sambo's village was also attacked by the rebels. &quot;They frog-marched us to a mountain and tied us to trees, promising to kill us the following day.  But they fell asleep that night and we managed to free ourselves and run away,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;As we drove out of the camp on the way to another refugee village west of Giyani, the refugees waved at us</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">and shouted:&quot;Tell the world about our plight.&quot; MOTHERS OF MERCY</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Working in a rehabilitation centre for Mozambican refugees has become a way of life for dedicated welfare worker Alice Maphophe and nurses Josephine Maluleke, Julia Mutshekwana and Alice Sithole.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They are &quot;mothers&quot; to the 2,000 refugees at Hluphekani camp, dispensing help and advice on a variety of subjects.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Refugee camps are normally breeding grounds for diseases such as kwashiorkor, diarrhoea and the effects of malnutrition - but hard work by the four has helped to end many ailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Sister Sithole said:&quot;We conduct health education for women when they come to the clinic with emphasis on family planning and how to breast-feed children.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Maphophe, who is responsible for the refugees'</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">welfare, said:&quot;They (the refugees) keep coming every week, but not in large numbers like before. It seems the war is really over because it is men and boys who are arriving now,&quot; she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;They say there's nothing but poverty and starvation back there.&quot; Reprinted from SUNDAY NATION, Aug. 15-21, 1993.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">787 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Plans are underway transform the moribund Pan-African News Agency (PANA) into a &quot;truly independent and professional news organisation, to become the leading source of information in Africa&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So says the recovery plan which intends to make PANA a privately-owned news and communication business run by media professionals, and using satellite technology to link Africa with both itself and the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PANA's new management, headed by Co-ordinator General Babacar Fall, has three years to make the plan work. Mr. Fall believes the plan will cost around US$6 million to implement, US$750,000 of which has already been pledged by UNESCO.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Founded in 1979 by the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), PANA had all-but collapsed by 1992, having swallowed US$18 million of member state funding in the process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the revival plan -- approved by the OAU last year -- points out, the agency failed because of unwieldy bureaucracy and editorial constraints imposed upon the agency by the governments whose interests it was supposed to serve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The recovery plan intends to do away with the bureaucracy and rigid state control in order to make the PANA an economically viable concern run by a variety of shareholders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We want to transform PANA into something which is not only for the governments, but also for all parties of society involved in communication,&quot; says Mr. Fall.  &quot;We don't think that communication is just something for one group of society.  It must benefit all groups.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Objectives outlined in the recovery plan certainly</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">have a post-Cold War feel to them, and they include:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Enabling private investment in a restructured shareholding shareholding system, with &quot;equitable participation of private investors such as financial institutions, publishers, press organisations, non- governmental organisations and individual shareholders&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Developing a &quot;truly independent and highly professional&quot; news agency &quot;capable of ensuring the free flow of information among African countries, and between Africa and the rest of the world&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Hiring staff capable of reporting freely on &quot;both the successes and failures&quot; of the authorities to improve life for &quot;disadvantaged groups, the youth, the minorities, African women and children&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Installing a satellite system owned by PANA and capable of distributing &quot;news products&quot; continent-wide, quickly and efficiently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Building-up &quot;an international market for PANA products&quot;.  Products will include not only news reports, but also &quot;specialised services&quot; determined by the requirements of &quot;an international clientele&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps most importantly, PANA's direction will no longer be decided by the Information Ministers of OAU member states, but by the PANA Foundation, made-up of representatives of national news agencies, media associations (such as MISA, which Mr. Fall believes could have a an important role to play in PANA's future), publishers, private investors, and the telecommunications industry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Foundation, in turn, will support the setting up of two PANA companies; PANA Press, which will run the news agency, and PANA Communications, which will be responsible for the mechanics of distributing PANA Press's information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> PANA's bureaucracy is currently being trimmed; political appointments are being ousted, correspondents are being hired, and regional bureaus are being restructured.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The United States Department of Transport on August 11 suspended air services between Lagos and America, alleging that the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos, &quot;does not maintain and administer effective security procedure.&quot; IBRAHIM MAMMAN, managing director of the Nigeria Airport Authority, NAA, which manages Murtala Muhammed Airport, in an interview with NEWSWATCH assistant editor, UTIBE UKIM, speaks on the US action and the state of MMA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: How would you describe the action of the United States government banning flights from and into Murtala Muhammed Airport?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: As you must have heard from the secretary for information, the action of the American government is political rather than objective. I am saying this because of certain developments that led to that. For quite some time, we have been discussing the security issue with American Federal Aviation Authority, FAA, officials. They came, we held meetings with them about the airport. They listed some shortcomings, which were corrected. They even drew up a certain manual which was signed by the then minister of aviation, transport and communication, Engineer Olawale Ige, after which they even conducted training, at their own auspices, for our men. Towards the end of July, they came, held meetings with the secretary of transport, communication and aviation, and expressed satisfaction at the progress that has been made since their last visit. Of course, the major issue that was outstanding then was the issue of photo I.D. card. That is, the identity card should carry the photograph of each individual. We do not have the machine here so we have placed order from the manufacturers in Germany, but we have not been able to take delivery. However, in the interim, we came up with something which they saw and approved. In fact, after the inspection of the airport, they went back to the ministry to express satisfaction at the progress made. To now say that the security system at the airport is not up to standard and they have suspended flight... so , on all accounts, it is more of a political decision than anything else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: You talked about some shortcomings which were noted by...</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: Those shortcomings had to do with access control and security identification display area which if you go to the airport now, you will see some points marked in red which means, within such boundaries only accredited people would be allowed to pass beyond that point. They were quite happy with that. And then there are some toll gates too. You notice that it is quite difficult to go into the airside because their control base are from the airport airside. All these have been put in place. So with photo I.D. card, every airport worker or anybody who has legitimate duty to do at the airport would carry a color coded photo ID card. Which means if you carry a photo I.D. card, it would only authorize you to go to certain areas. We only restrict you to some part of the airport, depending on the color of the I.D.  card. This is to enhance effective control on the movement of people within the terminal area.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: But don't you think the US action may have been due to the recent development, for instance the airport robbery case?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: It has nothing to do with the armed robbery. The armed robbers followed the bureau de change van carrying money from the town. It was not as if they just came to the airport and started vandalizing and shooting. they followed this man to his point of destination at the airport. It was unfortunate that it took place. You see, their own write up does not even mention the robbery incident.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Do you think that if the aviation security men were allowed to carry firearms, the incident of that robbery would have been averted?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: I believe you are perfectly right. Over the years we have been writing to government to allow a category of NAA security officers to carry arms. Definitely if the armed robbers know that the security agents are well armed, they would think twice before they break into that area to carry out an operation. But we are still pursuing this, and we believe that government may concede to allow just a section of the security officers to carry arms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: There is this other problem of multiplicity of security agencies at the airport. You have the police, the army, and NAA. Have they been streamlined now?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: I want to confirm that this has been done. In fact, following the meeting in the vice-president's office, last year, the number of security agencies has been reduced from over thirty to just six or seven. So that is what is subsisting at the moment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Since this ban by the American government, what efforts have you made to put your objections across to the department of transport?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: We have written our own report to the secretary of transport and aviation. He too is already discussing it at the government level. And they are doing other things to make sure that everything is in place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: How much have we lost in the course of this ban?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: Well I can't talk on the Nigerian economy. That is very global. Definitely NAA would lose in the sense that what we can derive in the form of passengers service charge, landing and parking, we would definitely lose. On the national economy, that is unqantifiable. You should also weigh the American government action against the background that so many foreign airlines have been coming here for more than 10 years. Nothing embarrassing has ever happened. Even as we are talking now, it is not that any hijacking has taken place or that terrorist activity or something close to that has taken place. That is not the background. So you would see that their action definitely is more political rather than anything to do with aviation security. The British Airways comes daily, Lufthansa comes regularly, Air France comes regularly, and so do other airlines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: In a letter the department of transport wrote, they mentioned that the warning they issued last October on the Lagos airport was the longest they have ever issued. Why, between then and now, weren't you able to come into an agreement?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: That was precisely why I said the action was a surprise because after their visit, the very last visit, they came prior to the announcement, they expressed satisfaction. That was July 22 when we met at the secretary's office. And the following week, they made their assessment and departed, only for them to issue a statement that the security situation was not adequate, just one week later.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: Murtala Muhammed Airport, is Nigeria's busiest airport and the first contact that many foreigners make with the country. The airport has a very bad image with report of touting and theft of passenger's luggage. How have you been able to address this?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: The issue of touting and luggage poaching has been drastically reduced at the airport. For the past three years, we have not heard of luggage being poached. this is due to the fact that we have now reduced the distance which luggage has to go through on the conveyor belt to the baggage hall. You would see that as soon as your luggage arrives, you can even see it discharged to the conveyor desk. So there isn't any room for anybody to poach on the luggage. That one has been virtually eliminated. And touting has been greatly reduced, to the barest minimum. We have the standing presidential task force, we have the security of NAA, and we have other agencies that are constantly at the gate and parading and inspecting all nooks and corners of the airport. But I want to add that there is definitely an environmental problem, a culture problem that people who have nothing to do find themselves at the airports. In any case, once this photo ID card comes into operation, that would be virtually eliminated, because if you don't carry an identity card, you have no business being found at the airport.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: How soon is the photo ID coming up?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: We are using a temporary one at the moment. The other one that we had to import will come by next month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> NEWSWATCH: And with that you would have satisfied all the conditions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> MAMMAN: We have virtually satisfied all of them with this temporary one, but with that we shall satisfy completely the FAA requirements.  Reprinted from NEWSWATCH, September 13, 1993</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Guguletu, early on a Wednesday afternoon. Potholed streets full of cars and taxis, pavements busy with hawkers and strollers. Banners up on the corner of the street where Amy Biehl was murdered, advertising for the forthcoming</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">events: a concert, a dance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I don't drive down NY1 (the NY stands for Native Yard), where Biehl's car came under a hail of stones, because my meeting is in Section Three, along another route which winds among cramped houses along crooked, rutted roads.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After the meeting, its business concluded, talk turns to Biehl's killing. &quot;It was a very, very bad thing that happened,&quot; says Kelly Langs, a street committee member for NY 141. &quot;It should never have happened. It mustn't happen again. Not in Guguletu.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Two street committee members accompany me to Guguletu Day Hospital.  This is more a courtesy than a necessity, for there are today no youth-led protests underway against a government whose policies -- and their legacy -- have accounted for an untold number of essentially racist killings, as indiscriminate as that of Amy Biehl's.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Instead, schoolchildren are gathered in a Guguletu church, attending a service dedicated to her memory. &quot;We did it to pay respect and to show that our organisation distances itself from her killing and is committed to non- racialism,&quot; says Congress of South African Students (Cosas) regional organiser JJ Tyhalisisu.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The memorial service is just one of many initiatives launched to mark people's rejection of racially motivated attacks and halt a burgeoning perception that Guguletu -- and by extension other townships -- have become no-go</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">zones for whites. The concerns are real: violence has compounded staffing problems at health and other township facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Guguletu Day Hospital, strain etched on her face. Dr. Carol Cragg tells of the haemorrhage of trained staff since January. There should be at least 10 full-time</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">doctors serving the clinic, she says: now there are only two. Instead of being treated, patients at township primary health care centres are now being turned away virtually on a daily basis, sometimes in their hundreds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Cragg expects Biehl's death to fuel more resignations by doctors too exhausted to continue struggling against odds that threaten to become too great -- and that the chances of vacant posts being filled will become even more remote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet, she says, it has been members of the community who have rallied to remedy the problem of health workers' safety to and from the townships, while their employer, the Cape Provincial Administration, which should be ensuring their protection, appears unable to find a solution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It was the community which came forward and which, together with the Peace Committee, helped arrange for us to have escorts and marshals. There have been meetings with the CPA about our safety but no decisions yet. We're here because the community needs us but we're also doing the CPA a favour by keeping the service going, yet it doesn't seem to care.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Things are basically just running into the ground,&quot; she says, &quot;I'm not supposed to talk to the press, but they can fire me if they like and this place will close.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Confronted with racist violence endured by black South Africans for hundreds of years, whites are tending to stay away. Only a handful respond to Father Basil van Rensburg's call to come and worship at St. Gabriel's Roman Catholic Church in Guguletu last Sunday, in itself a poignant comment on his open invitation, which asks the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">question: &quot;How on earth are we supposed to build our future together when we are so polarised that we can't even pray together?&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tomorrow a peace march has been planned for Guguletu at 10 am.  Announcing it at an African National Congress- convened summit on violence on Monday night, Zieila Dubase urged &quot;our comrades from outside the townships to join us in demonstrating non-racialism and to undermine the notion of no-go areas&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Reflecting on Biehl's death in a letter to a local newspaper, Mbulelo Teddy writes how it has &quot;brought shame to the peace-loving people of South Africa and in particular of Guguletu&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Suggesting that NY1, the street in which she lost her life and Guguletu's longest, should be renamed in her</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">memory, Teddy says: &quot;The people of Guguletu need to demonstrate their commitment to the ideals for which Amy fought. By naming NY1 in her memory we would be showing our respect for the ideals of democracy, non-sexism, non- racism and peace in which she strongly believed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Perhaps tomorrow's march will see white people living in Cape Town demonstrating a similar commitment to the same ideals.&quot; Reprinted from THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, September 3-9, 1993</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Some of South Africa's ambassadors may be replaced before the country goes to the polls next year, the African National Congress' new national chairman, Thabo Mbeki, has disclosed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Decisions about the appointment of new diplomatic personnel would be taken by the subcouncil of the transitional executive council (TEC) dealing with foreign affairs, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Giving the basic outlines of the foreign policies at a working breakfast in Johannesburg this week, Mbeki promised a &quot;complete revamping&quot; of the Foreign Affairs Department as soon as the TEC is in place later this month.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The foreign affairs sub-council, he said, would be in a position to decide diplomatic appointments as part of its brief of &quot;levelling the playing fields.&quot; As the ANC was seen as the government in waiting, he believed its representatives abroad would have &quot;a better impact than the ambassadors currently representing the De Klerk government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki gave some important pointers on the ANC's</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">foreign policies in the next few years:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * Normal diplomatic relations would be established with Cuba, Libya and mainland China.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The ANC would retain its &quot;close contact&quot; with the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and would back negotiations with Israel on Palestinian rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * A &quot;balanced regional economic policy&quot; would be followed to ensure South Africa did not dominate its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * South Africa's military capacity would be scaled down so that it posed no threat to its neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The fate of South Africa's armaments industry would be decided in conjunction with neighboring countries. It might be developed for the benefit of the region, or closed down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * The structures of both the South African Development Co-ordination Conference and those of the Frontline states would be maintained after being &quot;broadened&quot; to include a democratic South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On diplomatic appointments by the TEC Mbeki said criteria would first have to be decided -- in particular, whether political appointments were acceptable and whether professional diplomats should be given ambassadorial posts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The creation of a new foreign service would have to be addressed before next year's elections, with an eye on the long term. Although there was already a sprinkling of blacks in the diplomatic service, the department &quot;needs some revamping&quot;. Some existing diplomatic personnel might be put on pension. Mbeki said, but no one would be sacked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although a democratic South Africa had no wish to dominate the region, ANC president Nelson Mandela was already involved in efforts to influence regional politics, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He disclosed that Mandela had signed a letter to both President Eduardo dos Santos and Unita leader Jonas Savimbi in Angola, proposing a summit meeting to find a solution to that country's armed conflict. Other African countries involved in the peace mission were the Ivory Coast, Morocco and Gabon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Mbeki insisted that South African mercenaries had to be stopped from involving themselves in the Angolan war.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also disclosed that Nigeria's outgoing president, General Ibrahim Babangida, had had contact with Mandela, in a bid to involve South Africa as &quot;a significant future role player&quot; in making peace on the continent.  Babangida was planing a consultancy, with the blessing of the Organisation of African Unity, which would &quot;try to find mechanisms to resolve conflicts&quot;.  -30- Reprinted from THE WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, September 3-9, 1993</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1080 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As I speak here today, I cannot help but remember the appeals that we sent year in and year out to this Assembly and the member countries of the United Nations, describing the plight of our people and asking for legitimate sympathy, support and recognition. We appealed to the United Nations not only in its capacity as a representative of the international community, but also because of its special responsibility to Eritrea. For it was the United Nations that decided in 1950, at the beginning of the Cold War, to deny the colonized people of Eritrea their right to self-determination, thereby sacrificing their national and human rights on the altar of the strategic interests of the superpowers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In passing that resolution, the UN affirmed that it &quot;remained an international instrument&quot; which the General Assembly &quot;could be seized of&quot; at anytime. But for the next 41 years, as a brutal war of aggression was conducted against the Eritrean people, initially with the active support of the United States and later with a much worse and massive involvement of the Soviet Union, and despite the repeated appeals of the Eritrean people, the United Nations refused to raise its voice in the defense of a people whose future it had unjustly decided and whom it had pledged to protect. Not once in 41 years did Eritrea, scene of the longest war in Africa, and victim of some of the grossest violations of human rights, figure in the agenda of the United Nations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At this critical juncture of our history, Eritrea needs and deserves international support and assistance, not only because the United Nations and the international community bear special responsibility for Eritrea, but also because the United Nations and the international community bear special responsibility for Eritrea, but also because it is a test case for the United Nations Agenda for Peace and the whole concept of peace-building. Eritrea has not only secured peace and stability, it has made the rare achievement of establishing warm relations of cooperation with its former enemy, Ethiopia.  And it is tackling the task of reconstruction with popular support and participation, with commitment and determination, with sound and flexible policies, with prudent and efficient utilization of limited resources, with a demonstrated readiness to promote regional understanding and cooperation.  Unfortunately, the response of the United Nations and the international community so far has not been encouraging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most disquieting features of the present international situation is the marginalization of the entire continent of Africa. Every indicator shows that Africa is sliding back and being left behind, resulting in intolerable poverty, suffering and desperation for millions of its people.  There is no denying that the onus of the responsibility for these problems falls first and foremost on us Africans. But, I believe, the international community must squarely face the fact that it also bears responsibility for Africa's plight. Many of the dictators who have sown so much havoc and suffering were in fact brought to power and sustained during the years of the cold war by sections of the international community. Perhaps more significant, the now discredited economic policies and the failed projects, were generally designed, and approved of, by international donors and implemented under the direction of an army of foreign experts and advisors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In view of the developments in the Horn of Africa, the tragedy that has gripped Somalia has been profoundly disturbing. As the bloodletting among our Somali brothers assumed harrowing proportions, and at a time when many were hesitating, we strongly advocated the constructive intervention of the international community, under the umbrella of the United Nations, to save lives and help extricate Somalia from the destruction it was heading for.  Despite our opposition, in principle, to external military intervention, we realized early on that the extraordinary situation in Somalia demanded extraordinary measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was, therefore with great relief that we welcomed the decision of the United States Administration to intervene in Somalia. Encouraged, we sought individually and in conjunction with our regional partners to ensure that the intervention be guided by clear and comprehensive security, humanitarian and political objectives. And we did not hesitate to share our views on the size, type and stay of the intervention force needed for the success of the mission. But unfortunately, our views were not heeded, although we were, and still are, better placed to understand and work in the realities of neighboring Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Be that as it may, we do recognize and appreciate the achievements of the international intervention in Somalia.  The improvement of the humanitarian situation and the March 1993 Addis Ababa Accords on national reconciliation are major steps forward.  At the same time, the worsening security situation in Mogadishu and the increasing toll in civilian lives, including women and children, have cast a long shadow on the Somali intervention. Repeated mistakes in handling the situation have led some people to openly call for an immediate end to the intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is our conviction that a precipitate withdrawal of United States troops -- which we strongly warned against from the beginning -- will not only signal a lack of U.S. commitment to the intervention, but it will eventually make the position of UNOSOM untenable.  This will plunge Somalia into a catastrophe much worse than the anarchy that prompted the intervention in the first place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Rehana Rossouw spoke to ANC elections commission deputy head Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota(right) about the list: of candidates the organisation will compile for the election:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> South Africa's next president will almost certainly head the list the ANC compiles of its candidates for government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the organisation is in no hurry to begin drafting the list. It is promising members full participation in deciding who represents them in the national assembly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the election will be held on a proportional representation basis, voters will make their crosses for political parties, not candidates.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Each party will compile a list of 400 names.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The national executive committee recently endorsed a process which ensures that our list will be drafted by every branch and structure of the ANC,&quot; said ANC elections commission deputy head Patrick &quot;Terror&quot; Lekota.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The final list will include the names of ANC members as well as alliance partners -- organisations in the tripartite alliance (ANC/South African Communist Party/Cosatu) and the Patriotic Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC will have to juggle the nominees carefully to ensure the list meets members' expectations, that it is inclusive and gender sensitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ANC branches throughout the country will nominate candidates for regional lists in the next two months as well as recommend names for the national list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Parallel to the nominations, branches also have to begin the process of drawing up a manifesto for the elections,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After all the regions have nominated choices for the list, the ANC will call a national conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unlike previous national conferences, participation will be scaled down, but &quot;without compromising representivity,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The purpose of the conference will be to finalise the national list and adopt the manifesto.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Once names have been forwarded, the order in which they appear will have to be finalised. Some names on the list will be of people who will not go to parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We will be asking people with credibility to endorse the list and the ANC's campaign by adding their names,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;These will be put at the bottom of the list, in the lower 300's, where there is little likelihood of them being asked to go to parliament.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But not all the ANC membership's candidates will make the national list. The organisation will have to retain some of their leaders to represent the ANC at regional and local government level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet another consideration is leaving behind a core of leadership to continue the ANC's organisational work, although the operations will be scaled down considerably.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We have to keep in mind that we have to reserve some people for the other important structures of government,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Regional government, for instance, is going to be an important theatre of struggle for survival and the best way of interacting with people closely. So we cannot take all our best people to serve the country at a national level.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lekota said that while drafting the list will be as democratic as possible, the nominees would have to be rationalised by another body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Because this is a very sensitive and complicated procedure, we will establish a national list committee comprised of people with credibility to perform this task.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The committee will be dealing with a red hot poker, and they will have to be seen to be neutral. We are giving them the responsibility of running the process in every region. They will explain to branches how the process will work and develop criteria for the nominations.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC embarked on this process after attempts by the national executive committee to draft a list for members; ratification collapsed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There will be some room for individuals nominated to decide their fate and the list committee could rule against popular decisions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Obviously we cannot force someone who does not want to go to parliament to do so just because the members decided,&quot; Lekota said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Deadlines for the process have been set. The national conference will be held at the end of November or early December, as well as conferences of the ANC's Womens' and Youth Leagues.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The manifesto and list will then be presented to voters to decide whether they have enough confidence in the ANC to make their crosses on the ballot paper next to the ANC's logo.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 21, 1993--The 300,000 Somali refugees in Kenya are the forgotten part of Somalia's tragedy. This report details the extraordinary level of human rights abuses that these refugees are subjected to, at the hands of bandits and the Kenyan police and army.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The abuses include rape, killing, torture, detention, extortion, robbery, deportation and forced repatriation. This is not merely a reflection of violent crime in the north-east province, nor of the actions of a few undisciplined policemen acting on their own. Responsibility for the abuses reaches to the highest levels of the Kenyan government. Kenya has a long-standing policy of keeping down its refugee population by preventing would-be refugees from crossing the border, forcibly repatriating refugees, and forcing others out by making conditions so intolerable that few can bear to stay. Members of the security forces are allowed, and even encouraged, to engage in campaigns of systematic extortion against Somali refugees. The police can rape, torture, and kill refugees safe in the knowledge that they will never be called to account.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report contains details of more than forty instances of murder in custody by the police and army (in many cases the bodies are then burned), five cases of &quot;disappearance&quot; in police custody, two cases of death following severe beating, four people killed by the police opening fire indiscriminately, and one killing by bandits. It describes beating and torture carried out by the police, and arbitrary arrest and detention.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees have no recourse. Not a single policeman or soldier has been prosecuted for crimes committed against refugees. Most refugees do not even report the abuses they suffer, for fear of retaliation and because they have no confidence in the police and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The UNHCR is failing in its duty to protect refugees. It has not provided any legal representation for refugees detained by the police, nor brought charges against any security officers guilty of crimes against refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is an epidemic of rape in the refugee camps. In the five nights spent by Alex de Waal in three camps, 22 women reported having been raped.  Most were gang rapes; often the women were severely beaten</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">as well. This is just the tip of the iceberg: the majority of rapes go unreported, because the bandits and policemen responsible threaten retaliation against a woman who even goes to hospital for a medical examination, and because of the deep shame and lasting stigma associated with rape. Contrary to Kenyan government claims, policemen are responsible for many of the rapes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report documents 15 cases of rape. One is Hibo (not her real name), a 21-year old mother, raped (by three policemen in May 1993. She told African Rights how the policemen caught her in the camp marketplace:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The policemen drove close to the people, with the headlights turned off. Everybody scattered and ran away. I didn't run, I was too afraid. I just stood there. They came down from the car and started hitting me, slapping my face. First one came and grabbed my waist and picked me from the ground and pulled me towards the car. I can recognize the face of this one. His face was very close to mine. The other two, each took one leg and pushed me into the car. When they put me inside, they were holding a fist under my chin, pushing my head up so I had to look at the roof. I was screaming. They hit me on the chest: my chest was hurting for a long time.  They drove to the police compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;You know the police compound Ifo -- there is the residence of the police inspector, which has a small veranda, and there are two tents. They took me through the veranda, they took me to the tent. The tent was completely dark. Inside the tent there was a sponge mattress. They forced me to lie down. Because I was screaming one of them sat on my face -- I stopped screaming, I didn't have enough air to breathe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There was a strong alcohol smell from the men. The first one who had attacked me earlier was the one who first started raping me. It was totally dark but I could recognize his voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The one who was sitting on my face, he then got up and started holding my mouth to keep me silent. Then he also started holding my nose -- I found it difficult to breathe. I felt his hands on my face for a while; then I felt weak and he stopped holding me. Then he raped me. After he raped me he started beating me with his hands; he was suffocating me again. He hit me on the head and neck. I was crying but when I started being quiet he stopped beating me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then another one came and raped me. A third man -- I could recognize a different smell, and a different weight from his body. But I couldn't see his face.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Every time they raped me, they got a cloth and rubbed my body before the other one raped me. The force they were using and the harsh material was scratching my body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Then, after a while, another one came. I don't know his identity. He apologized. He started speaking in Swahili, I didn't understand but he was speaking gently and I felt he was apologizing. I was still lying down. He patted my thigh and said, 'Sorry, lady, sorry.' Then he sat at the corner of the tent and lit a cigarette -- this was the first light I had seen. Then I got up, stood up. He accompanied me to the front gate of the compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I left empty-handed. I had left all my things, the basket and thermos, in the market. I started walking towards the market. I saw a lamp lit in a kiosk. Men were chewing khat and talking about me and the incident.  They recognized me, made me sit down, and said my mother had been there looking for me, but had been too scared to go to the inspector's house, and had gone back to her tent instead. They could see my bruises. They could see what had happened but they didn't ask. They gave me some water to wash and drink. I rested for a few minutes. Then, seven men accompanied me back to my tent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;My mother was there. The oldest man stayed a little while, talking about repatriation. I didn't want to say anything. When all the men had left, I told my mother everything. My mother started making a fire to warm some water so I could clean my body. We made a decision that we should repatriate to Somalia as soon as possible. I felt, it's better for the shiftas (bandits) in my own country to do this to me, so I don't have to blame any government that is hosting me.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Any time I remember this story I feel anger, hopelessness, because I am a Moslem, and I believe that God has meant me to go through this hard life and only God can help me forget this problem.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> After she was raped, Hibo went to hospital for a medical examination.  When the police learned this, they started searching for her, presumably intending to ensure her silence by intimidating her or even killing her.  Since that time, Hibo and her daughter (aged six) have been living as fugitives, running from place to place. The UNHCR has declined to offer her any special protection. Hibo is currently trying to obtain resettlement to a third country as she is no longer safe in Kenya.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Kenyan government and police have repeatedly dismissed evidence of widespread rape by the security forces, saying that women allege rape in order to try to obtain third country resettlement or other assistance. UNHCR has appointed a specialist rape consultant, but it has failed to provide any protection for women vulnerable to rape or for rape victims. There are no specialist gynaecologists available to refugees. It has not brought charges against any security officers guilty of rape. UNHCR is not treating the rape crisis with the seriousness it warrants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The threat of forced repatriation hangs over the refugees. Many were sent back to Somalia in 1991 -- in one incident, 37 refugees drowned when the Kenyan navy tried to force them back to Somalia in an unseaworthy boat. The government refused to allow adequate relief supplies and services in the refugee camps, creating an unnecessary disaster in which tens of thousands of refugees died in 1991 and 1992. There have been several mass round-ups of supposed refugees in the major towns, for deportation to the camps. Kenyan Somalis and Somalis with European passports and travel documents have been rounded up by policemen who refuse to recognize any documents and are just determined to remove anyone who physically resembles a Somali. Now the government is insisting on a rapid programme of return to Somalia, arguing that Operation Restore Hope has removed the refugees' reasons for wanting to leave Somalia. However, few preparations have been made for their arrival and most refugees have little confidence that they will be able to go back in safety.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The UNHCR is failing in its duty to protect refugees. It merely passes reports of police abuses on to the police -- who ignore them or threaten the victims. It has not taken out a single court case on behalf of a refugee, and has refused to cooperate with refugees who have tried to bring private prosecutions. Although refugees are arbitrarily arrested and detained every day, it provides no legal assistance to refugees to prevent them from being illegally repatriated, detained on spurious charges, extorted of money or valuables, beaten or raped. Although UNHCR field staff have expressed grave concern about theses violations, UNHCR headquarters in Geneva has displayed little interest. Its staff scarcely ever even visits the camps. UNHCR headquarters has failed to make any public condemnation of the security forces abuses. On the contrary its policy is to placate the Kenyan government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The refugees are also victims of a very high level of crime in north-east Kenya. Banditry has been endemic in the area for thirty years, partly as a consequence of a long history of neglect and repression. Refugees are easy targets for bandits. The police are outgunned and justifiably afraid of the bandits; as a result they do very little to protect the refugees from armed robbery and rape by the bandits. Greater police protection is needed -- but when the government does send reinforcements the bandits merely scatter and the security forces take out reprisals on the refugees.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report concludes with a series of recommendations for the government and UNHCR. African Rights calls upon the government to investigate abuses committed by the security forces and prosecute those responsible. A few convictions for murder and rape would dramatically change the attitude of the security forces towards the refugees, and would encourage the refugees to report abuses. We call for special assistance to the victims of rape, and for improving the protection of refugees form bandits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">SIR DAWDA, DAILY OBSERVER, Friday, September 3, 1993</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The President, Sir Dawda K. Jawara, has hinted that the time may at last have come when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) should expedite its search for a common currency for the sub- region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The serious and expeditious search for a common West African currency will be a matter of urgent priority, he said, unless the current crisis surrounding the CFA franc is resolved soon. A delay in the resolution of the CFA crisis, he warned, could have &quot;serious repercussions for sub-regional trade, unless ECOWAS comes forward with a common currency&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jawara made those remarks in an interview with the Brussels-based Courier magazine published by the European Community's African- Caribbean-Pacific (ACP) bureau.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the CFA franc was the currency of sub- regional trade and its restriction will affect countries in the entire subregion, whether they are members or non-members of the franc zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was the President's first public statement on the issue since the decision on August 2 by the West African Monetary Union (UMOA) to suspend the repurchase of CFA bank notes circulating outside the franc zone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Making the sudden and dramatic announcement a month ago, the Governor of the Banque Centrale Des Etats d'Afrique Occidentale (BCEAO), Mr. Charles Konan Bany, said the objective of the measure was to arrest what he called &quot;the large-scale and fraudulent exportation of notes&quot;, especially by business people in the informal sector, who used the CFA franc as a means of payment and transaction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though Mr. Bany chose not to mention it, the real reason for the plunge in the CFA was the temporary losses sustained by the French franc in late July, following the raising by the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, of its interest rate. As an immediate and direct reaction, the French franc was devalued; and although it regained its position, the jolt to the French economic, financial and political establishment was enough for the government to take some immediate and drastic measures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the first such measures was to drop the CFA, so to speak, like hot potato.  This meant the Bank of France was no longer in a position to guarantee the CFA franc, thus retreating from the policy which they pursued for over nearly a quarter century. This policy was one of the pillars of the French hegemony in West Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> If the plunge of the CFA hit Banjul and other Anglophone capitals like a thunderbolt, it sent even more devastating shockwaves throughout Francophone Africa, the repercussions of which are evident in the current crisis in our sister Republic of Senegal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In his press interview, Sir Dawda noted that trade is the main pillar of sub-regional integration and the currency crisis was directly hitting at that pillar.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Until the CFA franc returns to convertability, business people both within and outside UMOA will have to look for alternative convertible currencies to lubricate trade within the subregion, he said. &quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;we have to wait and see how the situation evolves.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asked to comment on the slow progress towards West African integration since the founding of ECOWAS 18 years ago, Sir Dawda said he believed that economic difficulties and political instability within member states were responsible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> President Jawara was Chairman of ECOWAS in 1990 when the most serious case of instability in West Africa in recent years erupted namely, the civil war in Liberia. Thanks to his astute leadership and the forthrightness and determination of President Babangida of Nigeria and then Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, other ECOWAS leaders, and their brave men who comprise the peace-keeping force ECOMOG, the hostilities have ceased and peace seems to be taking hold in that war-ravaged country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Turning to the domestic political scene, Sir Dawda said he had no fears of instability in the country when he was no longer president. He declared, &quot;We have a long tradition of democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and tolerance, and I am optimistic that this country will remain stable when I am no longer in charge.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commenting on the professed aim to make The Gambia &quot;the Singapore of West Africa&quot;, the President said this was a dream but no wild one. The country's economic adjustment measures (the ERP and PSD) have gone so well that we have created a conducive atmosphere for investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All the necessary legislative framework for such investments has also been laid, he added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Courier asked Sir Dawda what he thought of the LOME Conventions as the framework for cooperation between the European Community and ACP member states. The President said he thought LOME was a good format but after nearly 20 years, it needed to be revised and improved upon. He was, however, critical of the slow disbursement of funds under the Stabilisation of Export scheme (STABEX).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">September 15,1993--More than 240,000 Burundian refugees remain in exile in Tanzania, Rwanda, and Zaire. Most fled Burundi following recurrent outbreaks of inter-ethnic conflict that killed nearly 200,000 people during the past thirty years. While members of the ruling Tutsi elite and the Tutsi-dominated army consolidated power and influence, many of Burundi's majority Hutu sought protection outside Burundi's borders. In many cases, the land and homes they left behind were taken over by Tutsi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now, however, fair and peaceful elections have taken place in Burundi, enabled by a forward thinking government led by (now former) President Pierre Buyoya. For Burundians in exile, the peaceful transition of power to Frodebu, a largely Hutu political party, brought their homecoming closer. According to a report released today by the U.S. Committee for Refugees, &quot;Today is the most positive political moment Burundi has experienced since independence.  The refugees are welcome home.&quot; Having successfully navigated these treacherous political waters, Burundi must now continue its transition to a state in which members of all ethnic groups are treated as equals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report, TRANSITION IN BURUNDI: THE CONTEXT FOR A HOMECOMING, was written by Catherine Watson, an internationally recognized expert on the modern history of Rwanda and Burundi. Watson is also author of a 1991 USCR publication, EXILE FROM RWANDA: BACKGROUND TO AN INVASION.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The new USCR report chronicles Burundi's little- known but traumatic post-independence history. It examines the very real fear of the Tutsi that they will be swamped, dispossessed, exiled, and killed by the Hutu, and the equally real fear and pain of the Hutu, who for decades had their self-respect and modest aspirations crushed and lived in dread of massacres.  It looks at why Burundi generated hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last thirty years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The report then looks at Burundi's refugee problem: the politics of Burundi's exile community, past attempts to bring the refugees home, and what the remaining refugees say they want before they will feel it safe to return.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, Burundian refugees wait to see what future lies in store for them, should they return. Only a few thousand have returned so far in 1993.  But now that Frodebu is in power, it is likely that many refugees will come flooding home. The paper considers the question: Is the country ready to receive them, or will this threaten the delicate political dynamic, risking the creation of more violence and another exodus?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In order to make possible the return of Burundian refugees, and to ensure continued positive developments inside Burundi, the U.S. Committee for Refugees makes the following recommendations:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Burundi's new government should deal with the Tutsi community with great sensitivity, building confidence and bridges of understanding. The Tutsi community will need to be self-critical and honest, and accept that it has enjoyed privileges in the past.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* Reforms in Burundi's army are imperative. Many Burundian refugees say they will not return home until there are Hutu soldiers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* A human rights commission should be formed to help Burundians sort out the tragedies of their past, and to move toward peace with one another.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">* The new government must seek out and work with leaders of the exile community to ensure that refugees have realistic expectations for when they return.  * A new commission must determine what happened to Hutu properties that have been misappropriated. If returning land to its rightful owner is not handled seriously and with fairness, violence could result. The land issue is key to the successful repatriation of the refugees.  * The international community should carefully monitor equity and human rights issues, and press the new government of Burundi to institute a culture of transparency and accountability.  * Refugees from Burundi will need assistance from asylum countries and from the international community as they return home. It is critically important that the UN system and donor governments make available the resources that are needed to make repatriation successful and reconciliation possible. The governments of Tanzania, Rwanda, and Zaire should ensure that refugees are not pressured to repatriate prematurely under unsafe conditions.  * The international community must support and foster national reconciliation in neighboring Rwanda and, when safety is assured, the repatriation of Rwandan refugees in Burundi. Unsettled conditions in Rwanda could destroy the progress being made in Burundi.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A study of South Africa's first socially responsible investment fund revealed it would have performed better than market leaders in the industry over a five year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Commissioned by the National Union of Mineworkers, the study coincides with the maiden annual results of the Community Growth Fund (CGF).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CGF gave investors a return of 16,3 percent, well above the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) All Share Index and inflation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Fund has 17 criteria for investment, including companies placing a high priority on job creation, good industrial relations which include recognition of centralised bargaining, training offered, opportunities for women and affirmative action.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fund attracted R44,8 million since starting in June last year, and continues to attract new investors which include retirement funds, savings groups and individuals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Union of Mineworkers, a large investor in CGF, compared their approved shares with various market leaders over three and five years.  This notional CGF portfolio beat all the market leaders over three years, and all but one over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CGF is only a year old -- too young for concrete comparisons.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, a theoretical portfolio was constructed and tracked back to 1988. The returns of this portfolio were then compared to two other unit trusts -- the market leader in terms of performance and the market leader in terms of size.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The results startled researchers at the Labour</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Research Service, which carried out the study: the notional Community Growth Fund portfolio beat the top performing fund over three years, and came close over five years. And the portfolio beat the unit trust industry's largest fund every year over five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The notional CGF portfolio also beat the JSE (JSE) Overall Index and the JSE Industrial Index, as well as inflation over three and five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The researchers also compared shares approved by the CGF with those rejected by participating unions. Again, the socially responsible portfolio won easily. The unions controlling the CGF have approved 21 shares -- used to construct the national portfolio -- and rejected 10.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Over five years, the approved shares would have returned 32,9 percent a year, while rejected shares achieved 26,6 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Socially responsible investing pays, said NUM's General Secretary, Mr.  Kgalena Motlanthe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He said the five-year study should comfort investors. &quot;We always believed that it was possible to combine good performance with social responsibility .</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The unions participating in the CGF have been tough on companies that have failed to meet their standards. But they have been responsible enough to select a good range of well- managed companies that satisfy CGF requirements.  And now we know that these companies are also top performers on the JSE.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Motlanthe added that there was a perception that the unions would go for companies with &quot;soft&quot; managements. And some critics believed profitable companies were those which squeezed workers hardest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The study has proved these perceptions wrong. Good management today must also mean good industrial relations and good relations with the union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Companies that adopt a hostile attitude to their workers are obviously getting lower productivity and industrial strife. CGF is selecting companies with good management all round, including social issues.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CGF is managed by Syfrets Managed Assets. While Motlanthe agreed that Syfrets has to get credit for selecting the initial portfolio, he added that the performance study showed that the union's involvement had actually added value to the portfolio -- the approved shares performed better than the rejected shares proposed by Syfrets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The union's role has been vindicated,&quot; he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gallant independent Sarajevo newspaper Oslobodenje has become a household name around the world. But few people have heard of the Sindicato dos Jornalistas Angolanos (SJA).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And yet, like the journalists of Oslobodenje, the 250 or so members of the SJA, Angola's only independent media organisation, are battling to keep press freedom alive in their country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Only, unlike Oslobodenje, which has been publishing for 50 years, the SJA is starting its campaign from scratch in a country where the media has never been free.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Members of the SJA have nothing, not even typewriters, with which to realise their dream of starting an independent newspaper and radio station midst the rubble of their war- shattered country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Like the country's journalists, the war in Angola is also largely ignored by the outside world. Claiming the lives of more than 1000 people a day, and having caused the displacement of millions of others, the Angolan war must surely be as devastating as the Bosnian conflict.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there is no saturation satellite TV coverage for Angola -- only a handful of reports buried in the foreign pages. Even in the southern African media, little is seen and heard about our brothers and sisters in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Of course, the war in 'Angola has also taken its toll on the media, just as the fighting has made journalism a highly treacherous profession in Bosnia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Angolan television reporter Elipidio Inacio was at least the fifth journalist to be killed in less than a year when he was caught in crossfire while covering the battle for Cuito on August 23.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Three months previously, two radio journalists -- Jose Maria Santos and Jose Manuel -- were murdered by as-yet unknown assassins in the coastal town of Lobito. The police said they had identified suspects for the killings, but as yet no arrests have been made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On December 4, doctor and editor of the political and cultural weekly Jango, David Barnardino, was gunned down in his Huambo surgery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Six weeks previously he had witnessed the murder of his writer-friend Fernando Marcelino, who was killed with his wife and sister when gunmen burst into Bernardino's home and opened fire as the four ate dinner together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, Bela Malaquias a radio journalist with UNITA's Radio Vorgan has been held under house arrest by the rebel movement since June 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are the most outstanding cases illustrating the perils facing journalists in Angola, although countless other cases of intimidation and assault have been reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In a bid to investigate the Angolan media situation, and to expose the country's unfolding tragedy to the outside world, MISA is to send a &quot;task force&quot; to Angola as a matter of utmost urgency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;One is forced to single out Angola as a country which has received scant attention,&quot; says MISA Chairperson, Gwen Lister. &quot;And yet it is a tragi c situation where the death toll is more than the number of deaths in Bosnia and Somalia combined.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SJA is appealing to anyone disposing of old but working typewriters to donate them to the union. This goes for any equipment which can be used by the SJA in its bid to launch an independent newspaper and radio station.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Meanwhile, the SJA is looking for funds to carry out a feasibility study into its proposed newspaper, and would also like to hear from funders who might be willing to support their newspaper and radio venture further.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The SJA can be contacted either direct on Tel.+2442334060/Fax.392216/PO Box 6375, Launda, Angola (ask for Avelino Miguel or Antonio Gouveia), or via MISA Head Quarters (Tel./Fax. +264 61 32975, PO Box 20783, Windhoek, Namibia.)</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In The Closing Days of The Independence campaign, Nigerian leaders must have looked forward to a great future for the country. Why not? Independence was at hand and they didn't have to fire a shot or spill an ounce of blood, either of the colonialist of the native or of the soldier of fortune. Things seemed to have been all arranged in heaven, and heaven is where things are done perfectly. So Nigerians started slapping each other's backs, why not, after all, independence was about to be delivered on a platter of gold. The flag of the oppressors would be down, our own flag would be up; we would sing our anthem merrily and our own men, our own black men from amongst us, would be in charge.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Besides, we had quite a lot going for us. Our people are energetic and hardworking and could work in the factories and farms from sun-up to sun-down. The weather is generally good just as the land is a lush, green velvet carpet in most parts of the country and all of these would guarantee a rich harvest. Once you sink your fingers into the soil, it would smile at you with a bumper harvest. Of course, 80 percent of the population was engaged in farming- -feeding their families and feeding the country's export market. By 1960, 85 percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings came from the export of agricultural produce--palm oil and kernels, cocoa, groundnuts, rubber, timber, and livestock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As a bonus point, we found oil under our feet, which made the story even sweeter and our future even more rosy. We knew we had gold in Ilesha, precious stones in Jos, uranium in Gombe but of course oil was the king of them all. By 1958, just two years shy independence, the petro-dollars had started trickling in and by the time the civil war broke out in 1967 oil had assumed a position of eminence. It is by its grace that Nigeria was able to conduct the civil war without knocking at the money lender's abroad. But the First National Development Plan (1962-68) had to be extended to 1970 on account of the war. The war over, the federal government launched a new plan, the 2nd (1970-74) which was largely expected to be a reconstruction and rehabilitation plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rise in the importance of oil occasioned by the rise in its price brought about a fall in the attention that the nation paid to agriculture.  People made a cityward swing, abandoning their villages and farms and poverty in search of the holy grail of cash and employment and enjoyment in the cities. The farms suffered, food supply shrank, the cities swelled, they became more congested, but the hopes and dreams of the invaders remained just what they</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">were: hope and dreams. the government looked into its vaults, found them brimming with petro-dollars, and went crazy. The Third National Development Plan (1975-80) originally designed to cost N33 billion was now revised to N43 billion because of the whopping revenue from oil. The government found the windfall overwhelming and bothered about how it could exhaust these jumbo finances in double</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">quick times so it went in search of grandiosities: it built airports where no plane lands; steel parts that produce no steel; a national theatre that works like an oven; roads and flyovers that sprawl like a spaghetti; we also shopped around for handicapped countries that we could help and rounded off our big-ticket projects with a grand-ballroom called FESTAC77, a feast whose exact cost no one knows till this day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> As the government showed this way, the people, the rich ones among them, followed. Even the not-s0-rich having been blessed with the Udoji awards bonanza went into town to show off their wealth. Bicycles were changed to motorcycles, and motorcycles to cars. Stereo, television and radio sets, cookers, washing machines and other electronic devices were snapped up in the shops and markets. The rich Nigerians, God bless them, who are perpetually in search of outlets for self-expression seized the chance with both hands. They imported everything from toothpick to tooth-brush. The car lovers sped for customised Mercedes, or Maserati or Bentley or Lexus or Rolls or Lamborghini or if they were greedy enough, they went for all of them. Those who cared for champagne ensured it was vintage and customised--with their names on it, of course. So the imports rolled in and we had our armadas--our rice armada, our cement armada and other armadas that choked our ports and our purses. We used pens from Korea, T-shirts from America, telephone sets from Japan, chewing gum from Britain, toothpaste from Italy. By the close of the 70s crude oil had become our golden gateway to goodies and by the dawn of the 80s it became our pernicious path to perdition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With the barrels of oil money came profligacy of the unabashed kind, and corruption of the over-the-table kind. Contracts were awarded and executed on paper while the money found its way into coded accounts abroad. Where the contracts executed at all the cost was mind-boggling when compared with costs in other developing countries. According to the Report of the Ministerial Committee on the Causes of the Excessively High cost of Government Contracts in Nigeria (1981) the cost of complete irrigation schemes per hectare in Liberia was N250, Cote d'Ivoire N500, Ghana N1,068, Nigeria (average)N2,470.  Nigeria (Bakalori) N7,540.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, in 1979 the cost of one tonne of cement in Nigeria was N72, Kenya N50.82 and Algeria N35.40 while the aggregate unit cost of building and road projects in Nigeria in the same year was at least, 130 percent higher than in Algeria and 200 percent higher than in Kenya. Some commentators have characterised this boom-spend period as party time, a time when Nigeria had a ball, a great feast, got drunk on it and broke the bottles and glasses and left behind a mammoth mess. The oil-bust period of the 80s has also been characterised as the day after the hangover, the day for clearing and cleaning the mess, for picking the pieces, for wondering what hit you.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So despite our various development plans, various policies and laws (Indigenisation Decree, Land Use Decree) and vast oil sales Nigeria wound up at the beginning of the 80s as a nation that exported oil the sales with which it imported food, as a nation that had substantially squandered its patrimony and was ready for the debt penalty. Olusegun Obasanjo, head of state 1976-79) imposed a set of austerity measures in 1978 in the effort to curb the country's gluttonous appetite for imports. It was too little too late. It would probably have brought some measure of sanity into the economy if the new civilian president, Shehu Shagari had not bowed to the pressures of political expediency and swung open all the doors. Once more it was business as usual.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When Awolowo, leader of the UPN, pointed at the red light and the fact that we might soon run out of gas and get stuck in the night he was shouted down. The government's apologists said we were in no danger at all, but were clearly coasting home. We soon found out that home was hell, it was high bills and low revenue, it was the IMF's door, it was high prices and low wages, it was a job-today-none- tomorrow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Muhammadu Buhari, The new head of state who took over from Shagari, attempted an iron-fisted discipline of lousy Nigerians, killing drug merchants, jailing currency offenders and regulating the economy to the point of asphyxiation. For him the way out of the currency crunch was oil swap otherwise called counter trade. But Buhari didn't sit around long enough for the full fruits of this measure to be realised before he was chucked out by Ibrahim Babangida.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Babangida made a few opening salvos that indicated he meant to deregulate and unshackle the economy. He abolished the notorious import license system, declared open a national debate on whether or not we should do business with the IMF and when Nigerians returned a resounding No he said we'd do it our own way. It turned out to be not our own way, but the IMF's way plus. The IMF and World Bank brought their desks into the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, and told us they wanted a structural adjustment programme, a massive devaluation of the naira, a 100 percent deregulation of the economy, privatisation of government enterprises and the removal of all forms of subsidy including the one n petroleum products. We tried hard to please the boss in the hope that they would put in a kind word for us on our debts- -or forgive us our sins of profligacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We introduced SFEM, then FEM and IFEM -- all in the effort to find a realistic rate of the naira. The aim was to let the currency float and find its level. Being a currency that has no lifebouy the naira sank, sank from 58 kobo to the dollar in 1980 to N1.52 to the dollar in 1986 and all the way down to N40 to the dollar in 1993. That's how far the naira has travelled on the road to ruin. Can you name 10 things you can buy with naira today? That's a quiz you can hardly win.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since SAP, inflation has risen like a meteor from 51 percent in June 1989 to 95 percent in 1993. Interest rates have shot through the roof-from 10 percent in 1987 to anything-goes percent in 1993. There has been an explosion in the banking and finance industry from less than 40 banks in 1980 to more than 180 banks, mortgage banks and dozens of road-side finance houses which have managed in the last two years to send some of their creditors to their early graves</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> by default in payment. However, some currency speculators have also made a killing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The cumulative effect of most of these measures has been, on the positive side, to liberate the creative energy of the people and to excite innovativeness. The negative aspects have been a massive loss of jobs by private and public sector employees, closures, takeovers and mergers of companies and extremely low capacity utilisation by surviving companies. Of course, the big multi-nationals have, like the whale swallowed their &quot;neighbors.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The CBN report 1992 indicates that Nigerian Newsprint Manufacturing Company's capacity utilisation rate was 13.3 percent, Nigerian Machine Tools 8 percent, a few have been higher, most lower. This low production puts a strain on the employment situation and this is not substantially salvaged by the establishment of the National Directorate of Employment NDE, or the National Apprenticeship Scheme or even by the envisaged efficiency and therefore expansion that privatisation was supposed to bring about.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Certainly, we're in the dark, stark woods. The Manufacturing Association of Nigeria, MAN, says that 700 of its 1500 members have closed shop since 1987. There are many more companies which have gone under but are not in the elite roll book of the MAN. They've therefore died unsung-- no wreaths, no funeral oration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Today, the economy is in a pathetic shape, made even more pathetic by the massive deficit and the political crisis. The budget surplus for 1992 was forecast to be N2 billion but we recorded a rumbling N44 billion deficit. The 1993 deficit was expected to be N28 billion but by June we had already gone into a hole with a N41 billion deficit. These cold statistics may not make sense to the layman but all they need to know is that they spell trouble for everyone except the very, very rich who have a cushion to sit on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But there's even more to worry about. In 1980/81 oil was sold for $40 a barrel, today it's gone down to $14, meaning that the 1993 budget which was based on $17 a barrel is catching cold fast. The various strikes we've had this year have also affected production making the industry a very vulnerable though vital artery. The refineries in Port Harcourt, Warri and Kaduna have not been able to meet the consumption needs of the country and the situation would probably have been tragic but for the 4th refinery in Port Harcourt.  But even with massive importation of petroleum products there are still gross shortages nation-wide and this has given rise to a resurrection by the petroleum ministry of the controversial subsidy debate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria has 100 years reserve of gas, which may be the reason we are pussy-footing over the Liquefied Natural Gas, LNG, a project that should produce four million tonnes per year. While we've been dragging our feet, Indonesia which started at about the same time as Nigeria has built five plants. The same slow pace of development has affected the development of the petrochemical plants. Although the first phase has been completed -- and carbon black produced -- the next and more advantageous phase is yet to be completed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But then even as we struggle to complete these projects we have existing debts to worry about. Currently, we spend about 1/3 of our export earnings to service $28 billion debt. The result is that we have only peanuts left for development projects. Real income has plummeted 10 times since 1985 while wages are crawling behind it. Amenities have deteriorated though their charges have gone up. Agriculture is in a state of abject neglect, imports are increasing while exports are nothing to write home about. The source-economic triangle is getting narrower at the apex, denoting a small, fabulously rich minority, and broader at the base denoting a greater pauperisation of the masses and the systematic elimination of the middle class, the engine room of any nation's development. According to the</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">World Bank report in 1988: Nigerians who lived in 1968 were better off than those who lived in 1988.&quot; That is not a great testimonial for SAP.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nigeria is good at talking about diversification. Indonesia is better at practising it. An oil-producing country like Nigeria, Indonesia's non-oil export was only 20 percent in 1983, today it is 60 percent. In 1983 Nigeria's non-oil exports were less than 10 percent; today it is still less than 10 percent or something like that. I say something like that because it is not fashionable to have correct statistics in Nigeria.</SPAN></P>

Volunteers posted to these countries will work closely with local farmers, small business people, and host country organizations to share their expertise on agricultural topics including distribution and marketing, women cooperatives, fruit and vegetable preservation and storage, rice and cassava marketing, sesame production and marketing, aqua culture, curriculum development and cooperative management. Volunteer assignments range from three to six weeks and the ultimate goal of these assignments is to help host farmers improve family income and nutrition as well as to increase overall food production and distribution. The Farmer-to-Farmer Program pays for volunteer travel, meals and lodging. All travel logistics (i.e. visas, passports, medical exams) are arranged and paid for by Winrock International. The volunteer experts contribute their time and expertise. For additional information and a volunteer application form contact Tom Bauer, Farmer-to-Farmer Program, Rt.  3, Box 376, Morrison, AR 72110; phone (501) 727-5435, ext. 253; Internet: tomb@winrock.org.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tokyo International Conference on African Development, October 5-6, 1993</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We, the participants of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD), consisting of African countries and Africa's development partners, declare with one voice our continued dedication to the development of Africa towards a new era of prosperity. We, therefore, solemnly adopt the present Declaration, in the firm belief that it will serve to strengthen an emerging new partnership for sustainable development of Africa based on self-reliance of African countries and the support of Africa's development partners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Background</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1.  Africa's economic and social crises of the 1980s highlighted the development challenges faced by this Continent. To address these challenges, many African countries have embarked on far-reaching political and economic reforms. We, the participants of TICAD, are encouraged by signs in recent years of both positive macro- economic performance and political development resulting from those reforms. In so doing, we nevertheless recognize the continued fragility and vulnerability of Africa's political and economic structures and situations that inhibit the achievement of sustainable development. TICAD intends to give further impetus to these reforms, taking into account the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (UN-NADAF).</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2.  With the end of the Cold War, African countries and the international community now have an opportunity to share a broader common understanding of the need for dynamic development cooperation. The development of the Continent has emerged as an imperative in our search for a better future.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 3.  While special consideration should be given to obstacles confronting Africa, we are determined to strengthen our collective forward-looking efforts for the development of the Continent. This has been the spirit in which we have conducted our deliberations on the issues central to sustainable development in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 4.  These issues include the on-going process of simultaneous political and economic reforms, the necessity of increased private sector participation in domestic economic activity, the promotion of regional cooperation and integration, and the detrimental effects of humanitarian emergencies on Africa's socio-economic development. We recognize that the Asian experience of economic development and the catalytic role of international cooperation offer hope and provide a challenge for African economic transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Political and Economic Reforms</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 5.  Convinced of the advent of a new international era, we, the African participants, reaffirm our commitment to pursue and further strengthen political and economic reforms, in particular democratization, respect for human rights, good governance, human and social development, and economic diversification and liberalization.  To achieve sustainable, broad-based economic growth, we, the participants of TICAD, believe that more open, accountable and participatory political systems are vital, including a stronger role for civil society. We recognize that political, economic and social reform must be initiated and carried out by African countries themselves, based on their visions, values and individual socio-economic background. Africa's development partners should therefore support African initiatives in these areas.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 6.  We, the participants of TICAD, recognize that simultaneous implementation of political and economic reforms, while conducive to development, may often entail painful transition processes. The interaction between political and economic reforms, which over time should be mutually reinforcing, is a complicated process which requires support to bring about progress. We, Africa's development partners, reaffirm our commitment to providing priority support to countries undertaking effective and efficient political and economic reforms. We, the participants of TICAD, also reaffirm our commitment to enhancing constructive dialogue to facilitate the reform processes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 7.  We, the African participants, reaffirm our commitment to improving the quality of governance, in particular, transparency and accountability in public administration. We recognize that criteria for public expenditure should aim at enhancing overall socio-economic development and reducing non-productive expenditures. The building of human and institutional capacities for sustainable development is essential for all of these objectives. We commit ourselves to creating the enabling environment for training, retaining and effective utilization of human resources and improving institutional capacities. We, Africa's development partners, will enhance our support for African capacity building including improved technical assistance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 8.  We, the participants of TICAD, reaffirm that structural adjustment programmes should take more actively into consideration the specific conditions and requirements of individual countries. We reiterate that political and economic reforms should ultimately lead to the alleviation of poverty and enhanced welfare of the entire population. To that effect, structural adjustment programmes should contain, more than in the past, measures to improve the access of the poor in particular to income earning opportunities and to effective social services, while seeking to shield them as far as possible from adverse social consequences. Increased priority should be given to investment in human capital through nutrition, health and education programmes, especially to improve the situation of women and children. Additionally, noting that the overall economic development in Africa has not kept pace with Africa's rapid population growth, we recognize the importance of sound population policies and call upon African Governments and the international community to address this issue within the socio-economic development process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Economic Development through Activities of the Private Sector</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 9.  The private sector is vital as an engine for sustainable development. We, the participants of TICAD, agree that though foreign aid has an impact on development, its role is only supplementary in magnitude and catalytic in nature. We recognize that a workable and practical cooperation between government and the private sector is a key factor for development. A climate of trust between these two actors should be encouraged and interaction promoted. We realize that political and economic stability is a prerequisite to commitments for long-term investments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 10.  We, the African participants, are determined to continue policies which foster a greater role for the private sector and which encourage entrepreneurship. While stepping up deregulation measures, we will provide and maintain, in cooperation with our development partners, physical infrastructure and viable administrative, legal and financial institutions.  We consider in general the informal sector as a source of vitality for African economies which deserves support in order to mobilize entrepreneurial capacity, generate employment, and to facilitate the transition into the formal economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 11.  We, the participants of TICAD, are convinced that further improvements in financial systems and practices are needed to stimulate domestic savings and investment, and to prevent and reverse capital flight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 12.  In support of these efforts, we, Africa's development partners, shall continue to provide assistance in order to improve the enabling environment which requires economic reforms and privatization, the building of human and institutional capacities, and the development of financial intermediation. We recognize the importance of appropriate insurance and guarantee schemes to protect private enterprises investing in Africa from political and economic risks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13.  We, the African participants, affirm the central importance of international trade to our future development prospect. We, Africa's development partners, will work to facilitate market access for African products globally and to assist in up-grading and diversifying African exports. We, the participants of TICAD, support the vital role of private associations such as the African Business Round- Table and confirm the usefulness of investment- and trade- promotion initiatives within Africa and between Africa and the rest of the world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Regional Cooperation and Integration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 14.  We, the African participants, reaffirm our vision and aspiration for ultimate regional integration and cooperation goals as embodied in the Abuja Treaty establishing the African Economic Community. We, the participants of TICAD, realize that although these goals have been, since the early years of independence, a logical development strategy for African countries, most of which have small national markets, greater efforts must now be made in promoting intra-regional trade and investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 15.  We, the African participants, will ensure that our commitments to regional schemes are fully incorporated in our national development plans, policies and programmes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 16.  We, Africa's development partners, welcome and support the renewed commitment to regional cooperation and integration as has been recently demonstrated by African countries. These regional arrangements should continue to be consistent with the multilateral open trading system, and contribute to trade expansion. We will continue to extend our support to African countries' efforts aimed at reducing obstacles to integration through measures such as reduction of trade and investment barriers and policy harmonization, and to viable regional endeavours particularly in the area of infrastructure development and capacity building. We, the participants of TICAD, believe that regional integration should also be pursued by encouraging private sector initiatives, adopting consistent and gradual approaches for broadening exchanges and rationalizing existing schemes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Emergency Relief and Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 17.  We, the participants of TICAD, note with great concern that over the last two decades, and particularly in recent years, that a large number of African countries have suffered and are still suffering from natural and man-made disasters. The international community has responded generously to these situations since the early crises in the 1970s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 18.  These disasters have constrained development in many African countries, destroyed the very basis for development, increased the number of refugees, and diverted human and financial resources that otherwise could have served development purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 19.  We, the participants of TICAD, realize that man- made disasters are the result of a complex interplay of political, economic and social factors. In this context, lack of democratization and respect for human rights and the rights of minorities are among the root causes of these disasters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 20.  We, the participants of TICAD, accept that responsibility for disaster prevention and management rests primarily with Africans themselves.  We, the African participants, are therefore determined to devote our efforts to addressing the root causes of these disasters. We also confirm the critical role of regional cooperation as demonstrated in the past. We, the participants of TICAD, underscore the need to establish effective mechanisms for prevention , preparedness and management of man-made and natural disasters in general, and to strengthen food security schemes in particular.  We, therefore, welcome the decision of the Organization of African Unity to establish the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management, and Resolution and pledge our support to strengthen the effective functioning of this mechanism. We also reaffirm our willingness to assist victims of disasters, and urge the removal of all hindrances to effective distribution of relief supplies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 21.  We, Africa's development partners, having recognized that there is a continuum between emergency relief and development, will ensure that the humanitarian assistance for the affected communities continue to be provided for resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Asian Experience and African Development</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 22.  Over the past 30 years, in contrast to Africa, the countries of East and South-East Asia have achieved high rates of growth in per capita income. We, the participants of TICAD, are mindful that in view of the differing international and internal conditions no one model of development can be simply transferred from one region to another. Nevertheless, we acknowledge some relevance of the Asian experience for African development.  The very diversity of successful Asian countries gives hope that lessons can be drawn for African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 23.  We, the participants of TICAD, have noted that as demonstrated by the successful examples of the Asian development experience, the backdrop of development success lies in the combination of a strong commitment by the leadership and the people to economic prosperity, appropriate long-term development strategies and functional government administration to pursue these strategies coherently.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 24.  We have also noted that the policy factors which contributed to the remarkable performance of East and South- East Asia have included (1) the rational application of macro-economic policies and maintenance of political stability, (2) the promotion of agricultural production through technological research and innovations as solid basis for socio-economic development, (3) long-term investment in education and human resources development as priority of development strategy, (4) market-friendly and export-led policies to advance and adapt modes of production in order to increase opportunities for trade and economic growth, (5) measures to stimulate domestic savings and capital formation by developing financial intermediation and by expansion of banking services at the community level, (6) policy emphasis on the private sector as an engine of growth and development, and (7) early implementation of land reform.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 25.  We, the participants of TICAD, recognize that development achievements in East and South-East Asia have enhanced opportunities for South-South cooperation with Africa. We welcome the interest shown by some Asian and African countries in promoting this cooperation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International Cooperation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 26.  We, the participants of TICAD, have concluded that the current situation in Africa calls for increased solidarity among us to act in full partnership to address this situation. This new partnership should be based on Africa's objective to achieve self-reliance on the one hand and responsive support by Africa's development partners on the other.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 27.  We, the participants of TICAD, agree that stability and security are prerequisites to sustainable development, and that it is essential to make efficient use of scarce resources and to minimize military and other unproductive expenditures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 28.  We, the participants of TICAD, realize that development calls for full participation by the people at all levels, who should be galvanized toward action as agents for progress. In this regard, we acknowledge the dynamic and diversified role of African women in various sectors of the economy and recommend that special measures be taken to promote their rights and roles in order to enhance gender equity and to remove all legal, social and cultural barriers for advancement of women. Furthermore, we recognize the need to enhance cooperative efforts with local NGOs and other institutions of civil society which play constructive roles for African development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 29.  We, Africa's development partners, will make all efforts to enhance development assistance to Africa, despite current global economic difficulties. This assistance will be increasingly oriented toward the priorities set by African countries. In making commitments to continued and enhanced cooperation, we will take into account the expectation of our constituencies that resources be spent where they are most efficiently utilized for the greatest development impact.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 30.  As African countries are at various stages of development, and have different cultural and historical backgrounds, we, Africa's development partners, may take differentiated approaches as we plan and implement our development cooperation, with due regard to aid coordination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 31.  We, Africa's development partners, will apply a comprehensive approach covering aid, trade, debt strategy and investments. We, the participants of TICAD, reaffirm that debt and debt service still pose serious difficulties to many African countries. We emphasize the necessity to urgently address the debt issue within the overall context of debt relief and flows of new financial resources for development. We confirm the validity of the international debt strategy and invite the Paris Club to continue reviewing the question of debt relief for the poorest highly-indebted countries, especially with regard to earlier reductions in the stock of debt on a case by case basis. We urge creditor countries to take into account the difficulties that heavily indebted African countries are now facing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 32.  We, the participants of TICAD, reiterate the importance of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and will make all efforts to remove trade barriers and other trade practices that prevent the expansion of African exports including exports to other African countries. We underscore the importance of primary commodities for many African countries' export earning and the need for diversification to reduce the volatility of these earnings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 33.  We, the participants of TICAD, confirm that United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) agreements should be steadfastly implemented with a special emphasis on balanced relationships among agriculture, population and environment policies, particularly drought and desertification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 34.  We also recognize that many of the gains made in Africa are threatened by the HIV/AIDS pandemic and related diseases which are already of a disastrous proportion in some countries. There is a need for a much stronger response by Africa and its development partners, for preventing and controlling these diseases including caring facilities as well as measures addressing its socio-economic impacts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Follow-up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 35.  We, the participants of TICAD, pledge to take, in our respective spheres of responsibility, measures aimed at advancing the spirit of this Declaration through effective policies and actions. We have entrusted the three co-organizers of TICAD with evaluating and reviewing progress made towards the implementation of this Declaration. Ultimately, we intend to hold a conference of a similar magnitude and membership at the latest before the turn of the century.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> * * * * *</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By virtue of the deliberations, guidance and consensus of the conference we believe that prospects for significant development of Africa have been greatly enhanced.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Excerpts from a Statement by Francis M. Deng (Senior Fellow Foreign Policy Studies Program, The Brookings Institution) to asymposium on the Sudan sponsored by the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Subcommittee on Africa of the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs, Washington, D.C., 20 October 1993 Options for Conflict Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the North-South conflict, several possible options recommend themselves. One which now seems most unlikely would be a major transformation of the present regime to allow the formulation of an accommodating national framework that would remove religion from the public arena and make all the Sudanese feel a sense of equitable belonging to the nation, and participate as equal citizens without any racial, cultural, or religious discrimination.  The other which is more likely would be for this regime to agree with the SPLM/SPLA (in whatever configuration) to coexist in a loose unity, whether confederal or federal. A genuine federal arrangement would allow the two parts of the country, as well as other regions, to coexist and pursue their respective social, cultural, and religious logics, with sufficient room for free interaction and mutual assimilation among ethnicities, cultures, and religions as a matter of individual choice.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The third option which is winning increasing support in the South and internationally is to recognize that unity is not an end in itself, that the Sudanese have not only suffered for far too long in the name of unity, that the conflict is preventing both sides from realizing their aspirations and potential, and that partition might be the best way of releasing the resources and energies of the people to be invested in a more constructive process of well-grounded development and nationbuilding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is a fourth option which some people believe is quite possible but which most observers dismiss as neither desirable nor feasible, and that is military imposition of a model by one party against the will of the other party. In the present circumstances, the party strong enough to contemplate such a victory is the government, but so deeply- rooted are the animosities and so entrenched are the positions that the effect of such a victory would only be to reduce the SPLA to a guerrilla army still capable of pursuing a protracted war with sustainable impact on the security of the South and the economy of the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fifth option which could generically come from within or emanate from the dynamic changes outlined under option four is a change in government that would allow any one of the first three options to be realized, in case the present regime chooses to pursue military victory and refuses to compromise along the lines of the postulated alternatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The scenarios for the resolution of the secondary layer of conflicts can be summarized in terms of the need for internal resolution as a prior or subsequent condition to a comprehensive settlement. Most of the major Northern factions share the Arab-Islamic agenda to one degree or another, and virtually all the Southern factions agree on the main elements of the Southern demands and differ only on tactics or strategies. Although differences within the South have generated much violence, they do not compare in scale to the differences between the North and the South, despite the fact that tactical alliances may induce the factions to cooperate across the North-South dividing line. Involving the International Community</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The quest for peace requires third party mediation. This is why Sudanese on all sides are busy lobbying the international community to their point of view. The mere fact that we are assembled in this symposium is testimony to the significance we attach to the role of the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite the reluctant attitude of the international community over Bosnia and the current ambivalence in the United States about involvement in Somalia, the now dominant forces of the market economy and the conscience of the human rights constituency combined with the watchful eye of the international media cannot in the long run allow democracies to stand by and watch countries brutalize themselves in genocidal conflicts without some form of involvement, humanitarian, diplomatic, political, or even military. What is important, as this meeting shows, is that there are a wide variety of ways by which the international community could assist the Sudanese in their search for domestic solutions, which, in the long run, are the only means of achieving sustainable peace in the country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Sudanese conflict, by virtue of its structure, is a reflection of regional and international identities and their interests. It is indeed an irony of history that the civil war in the Sudan should be the result of the country's greatest promise as a microcosm of Africa and a bridge or cross-roads between the continent and the Middle East. But the Sudan has lived under this illusion for far too long without translating it into tangible rewards. On the contrary, this aspiration has been a major factor in tearing the country apart. The Imperative of Peace</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The tragedy of the war and its humanitarian challenges dictate an order of priority which the international</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">community is called upon to demand and support:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> First, hostilities must stop immediately with the declaration of a cease-fire based on an open admission by all sides that only through a political solution will a lasting peace be achieved in the Sudan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Second, the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies must be declared by all the factions as an overriding objective to which they will render their unreserved cooperation with the international community.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Third, pending a final resolution of the conflict and with a commitment to a non-violent search for peace, the parties need to agree on an interim administration of the South that will maintain basic social order and facilitate the delivery of essential services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Fourth, with the help of the international community, Southerners and Northerners must be encouraged to unify their internal fronts and at the earliest possible opportunity organize a truly national peace conference of all the political forces with international observers to address the major constitutional issues pertaining to North- South relations and the form of governance appropriate to the country. In this connection, there is an urgent need for all third parties involved in the search for peace to coordinate their efforts in order to reinforce one another and increase their effectiveness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evidence is mounting that the international strategy to boost aid flows to Africa is in serious crisis. New lending commitments by the World Bank to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 per cent -- or $1.2 bn -- in its last financial year, even though its overall lending increased by 9 percent. Last year, Western aid to all developing countries rose by only 1.1 per cent in real terms, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Although a regional breakdown is not yet available, OECD officials say they do not expect flows to Africa to be above this trend and, for bilateral aid, could well be lower. Forthcoming analysis from the UN is expected to further confirm this picture.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We fear that the upward trend in aid to Africa of the 1980s may have come to an end,&quot; one OECD official told AFRICA RECOVERY. Figures for 1990 already show a worrying stagnation in net aid flows to Africa. This contrasts sharply with the 1991 call in the UN New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s (NADAF) for real growth in annual aid flows of at least 4 per cent.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other officials express more optimism that aid flows to Africa can be maintained, pointing to Japan's recent announcement of a 50 per cent increase in its overall aid over the next five years, as one source of new funds for the continent. The real test for African aid will come at the end of this year, they argue, when the World Bank is expected to seek pledges for its third Special Programme of Assistance (SPA) for Africa. The Bank raised some $7 bn in additional pledges for SPA II, which is now coming to and end, and a similar amount is being sought for the 1994-1996 programme.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, &quot;alarm bells are already ringing&quot; over the trend in aid flows to Africa, Ghana's Ambassador to the US Joe Abbey told AFRICA RECOVERY. A number of major bilateral donors have either cut back on aid plans or signalled their intent to make existing funds stretch further. From multilateral agencies, African borrowing is increasingly concentrated on their soft-loan affiliates, a reflection of the inability of a growing number of countries to afford the cost of borrowing from the main lending arms. But it is the voluntary bilateral funding of these soft-loan facilities, including the UN, which is now under the most acute pressure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the World Bank, commitments to sub-Saharan Africa in 1993 from its soft-loan International Development Association (IDA), held up much better than from its main lending arm. IDA credits, at $2.77 bn, were only some 14 per cent down on the previous year's level of $3.23 bn. New commitment from the more expensive International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), however, all but disappeared from the sub-continent, totalling only $47 mn in FY 1993 compared with $738 mn the previous year. Explaining this trend, the Bank's Chief Economist for Africa Ishrat Husain argues that the IBRD's hard terms should not be extended to most African countries as they will only add to their already considerable debt burden.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also reports a downturn in lending to Africa in its latest financial year. Disbursements totalled some $525 mn in the year to 30 April 1993, compared with just over $1 bn for the previous year, a fall of close to 50 per cent. Zimbabwe was the only new African borrower from the Fund's regular accounts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> World Bank officials argue that not too much should be read into a single year, pointing out that the $4 bn level in commitments achieved in 1992 was significantly up on the previous year. Bank gross disbursements in 1993, at $2.62 bn, were actually up on 1992. When all repayments are taken into account, Bank net transfers to sub-Saharan Africa in 1993 were sharply up at $874 mn, compared with $794 mn the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall Bank lending to Africa since 1990 has shown a worrying volatility at a time when it is seen as the lead agency for mobilizing increased resources for the continent. But Mr. Husain says this is explained largely by the ups and downs of IBRD lending to countries such as Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. The trend line for IDA commitments since 1989 is holding at a relatively healthy $2.7 bn a year, he says, well up on the $1.4 bn average for 1984-1988.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To explain the 1993 downturn, the Bank cites a shift from adjustment lending, with its fast-disbursing element, to slower project-based lending.  Non-project lending to sub- Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to $455 mn and from $895 mn the previous year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bank also stresses the role of political factors, specifically &quot;administrative delays resulting from the political transitions in a number of countries.&quot; Turmoil in once large borrowers such as Zaire have influenced overall lending levels, as has less dramatic events in countries as such Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Togo. OECD officials also quote Africa's political problems as a significant factor in stalling the aid push for the continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even favoured clients have not been immune, Mr. Abbey points out, with his own country Ghana seeing the disbursement of some $170 mn in credits halted last year as the Bank questioned extra spending prior to the elections. While reserving judgment until more detailed figures are available, Mr. Abbey questioned whether increasing conditionality in Bank lending, including the difficult issue of good governance, was causing a significant slowdown in the administration of aid. Recent Consultative Group meetings for Ghana, Uganda and others, however, have shown that donors are still prepared to pledge significant funds for selected countries. Growing aid competition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OECD officials point to the growing competition with politically &quot;more important&quot; regions as another explanation for the slowdown in aid to Africa.  The fall in Bank lending to Africa coincided with a large surge in commitments to Eastern Europe -- up $1.7 bn to $3.8 bn. Bank officials strongly deny any linkage with the decline in commitments to Africa, stressing that this is IBRD funding not IDA, but the trend does nothing to ease Africa's long-voiced fears that it is being marginalized.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The latest plans for a $3 bn development fund for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, following the signing of a peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, has added a new competitor to the lists.  The European Community is promising to be a major source of money for the new fund. With pressure in the Community to also commit more resources to Eastern Europe, its recently unveiled plans to seek a revision of the Lome Convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries is seen as confirmation of a significant shift in aid priorities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even where Africa is securing official funding, an increasing proportion is going on humanitarian and peace- keeping operations rather than on development programmes. Pointing to the expected $2 bn cost of UN operations in Somalia, Mr. Abbey voiced his regret that &quot;such resources do not seem to be available for more positive things.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most concern is now centred on the growing competition for the limited funding available for boosting the concessional facilities of multilateral agencies. OECD figures show that while bilateral aid to all countries fell by 6 per cent in real terms in 1992, multilateral aid rose 16 per cent. US Congress aid cuts</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the latest replenishment of the World Bank's IDA keeps overall funding barely stable in real terms and for far more recipients, although Africa's informal 48 per cent share of the total has been retained. Even then, the US Congress is discussing a 25 per cent cutback in this year's US IDA appropriation. IDA could face significant US arrears by the end of its three year cycle in mid-1996, according to aid officials. This could have major implications for negotiations on IDA XI, which will fund African development programmes in the second half of the 1990s.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other institutions are also seeking extra funds for concessional lending. The IMF is hoping for agreement from finance ministers at the end-September annual meeting of the Fund and Bank in Washington for a replacement to its enhanced structural adjustment facility, which expires in November. Its executive board has proposed a new facility of $8 bn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The African Development Bank (ADB), which claims to make higher net transfers to Africa than the World Bank, is currently seeking a 50 per cent increase to its soft-loan African Development Fund, in large part to compensate for tighter lending conditions on its main arm. Already, lending from this arm is restricted to just 17 countries, with the five North African economies taking over half the volume of these loans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN agencies, while retaining their priority concern for Africa, are also feeling the effect of increased competition for funds. In its 1992-1996 programme cycle, UN Development Programme funds are 25-30 per cent down on the previous five-year period, a fact which drew strong protest from African delegates to its June Governing Council. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF both report pressures on their funding, despite renewed US commitment for the latter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Overall, bilateral aid remains stable, with its share of OECD gross national product (GNP) in 1992 at 0.33 per cent, according to the OECD's Development Assistance Committee. Denmark and Sweden have joined Norway in committing more than 1 per cent of their GNP to aid. Finnish aid, however, has slipped below the UN target of 0.7 per cent, following a near 24 per cent cut in real aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In total, eight of DAC's 21 members showed a decline in real aid flows in 1992, including Japan, which competes with the US as the world's largest aid donor. As well as Finland and Japan, aid from Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK fell in real terms in 1992, with possible impact on Africa. Recently, a US Congress committee made a $55 mn cut in the $800 mn request from the Clinton Administration which would have kept funding stable in nominal terms for the US' main African aid arm. Japan aid boost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Japan, however, has pledged to substantially increase official flows, making up to $120 bn available over the next five years. This commitment is expected to remain despite the change of government in August, officials say.  The Tokyo International Conference on African Development in October has underlined the Japanese commitment to Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In many countries, the traditional concept of development aid is now being questioned. New proposals to the Clinton Administration would radically change the concept of US aid and how it is administered, with at present unknown consequences for the overall level of official support. Dutch Development Minister Jan Pronk recently argued that global political changes had consequences for the definition and function of aid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> OECD officials warn that Japan's increased aid alone cannot reverse the threatening downturn in official flows to Africa and that further resources are needed from other donors. But the World Bank's Mr. Husain also argues that simply seeking increased aid flows will not necessarily encourage development and, by creating increased dependency, could actually stall recovery efforts. &quot;What is really needed is a mix of adequate debt relief, sustainable new money and increased domestic resources mobilization,&quot; he says.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armscor is up for grabs. The pacifists don't want to reap the spoils of war, the profiteers want to sell its services and products, and the pragmatists want its know-how to upgrade civilian industries, writes Stephen Laufer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> High-explosive shells leave the muzzle of Armscor's G- 5 cannon at over 3 200km/h. Unlike the days of black powder and shot, when all that counted was hitting the enemy with something hard, modern warfare requires precise information on the shell's behaviour during flight, and what happens when it reaches its target.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The answer is telemetry, a sophisticated measurement system which tells the generals what the shells are doing. Crammed into the nose-cone, high-tech electronics radio thousands of pieces of data back to specialists at a test site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armscor considers itself an international leader in telemetry, and it would like to sell its boffins' services worldwide, in much the same way as it would like to export the other products of South Africa's military high-tech base -- armoured vehicles, attack helicopters and other lethal equipment.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But as the country emerges from the international ban on arms trading -- which led to a major strengthening of the domestic capacity for the research, development and manufacture of sophisticated weapons systems -- the debate on the future of the industry is taking shape.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Pacifists and profiteers are pitted against one another. The arms lobby argues the time has come to reap the financial benefits of years and billions spent perfecting the South African Defenc e Force's war machines. Their opponents counter with the biblical demand for swords to be turned into ploughshares.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the peaceniks, the issue is clearcut. &quot;Seeing the suffering war has brought to Angola and Mozambique, I don't believe weapons exports can be good for us or for Africa,&quot; said Catholic Bishop's Conference secretary general Brother Jude Pieterse. &quot;There is no way the bishops want to see the country's economy built on arm sales.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We recognise that jobs and skills are tied to the arms industry,&quot; said David Bruce of the End Conscription Campaign, &quot;so it won't be able to shut tomorrow. But the objective must be that South Africa no longer be a promoter of war. The industry should be scaled down.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Keeping the industry at present levels could prove seductive. With 70000 jobs, the arms industry is a major employer, despite having shed 30000 positions from its peak. Exports accounted for sales worth R419-million in the last financial year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So it is likely to be the pragmatists in the middle who prevail, because of the technical skills and resources invested in the arms sector. Centred on the labour unions and military researchers close to the African National Congress, this school of thought wants to see the industry's know-how converted into a booster rocket for the civilian economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their task will be to get away from the beguiling logic of the international arms industry, which has its subscribers across the political spectrum, including members of Umkhonto weSizwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For the skills and technological advantages built up over a generation to survive and continue competing internationally -- so goes the militarists' argument -- manufacturers need to be at the cutting edge of a range of relevant technologies. Maintaining that position is dependent in large part on the domestic consumer, the national defence force, paying for research and development and demonstrating confidence in the finished product by buying it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Which may explain the air force's latest purchase of four Rooivalk attack helicopters at R8-million a piece, for testing and evaluation purposes. Like the new tank Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee praised last week as proof that South Africa is a world player in the development of high-tech military systems, the killer choppers were conceived in a period of conflict with South Africa's neighbours.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Unsuited to internal law-and-order use, they are obsolete -- unless doctrines are developed to justify their acquisition. These in turn require a scenario under which South Africa faces a conventional military threat which, by its nature, is most likely to be external. Such doctrines become powerful arguments in the sale pitch to foreign defences forces.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Even if the doctrines can be developed, making the international sales will be difficult. The world market is saturated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the air force generals are unlikely to disappoint the salesmen, unless the eternal circle is broken. The allusions of old to the civilian spin-offs -- the most famous example being the development of teflon frying pans as a byproduct of the United States space programme -- are unlikely to suffice, say those who want to see the defences industry take a different course.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;We would like to see a public debate on the need for weapons upgrading, coupled with a conversion council whose task it will be to examine ways of using the defence industry's resources to upgrade civilian industries,&quot; says Bernard Fanaroff, of the National Union of Metalworkers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The fact is that Armscor and the private arms manufacturers, because of the resource available to them for years, have captured the country's top class scientists and technicians. They are a national asset with high skills levels, top training facilities, and very sophisticated manufacturing equipment, all of which are in short supply in the civilian sector.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armscor, Denel and the private sector arms maker are also streets ahead of the rest of industry when it comes to project management and technology acquisition, skills developed under the adverse conditions of the United Nations and other boycotts against South Africa</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The challenge, says Fanaroff, will be to upgrade local industry using the know-how and tools already available in the country, but until now narrowly focused on arms production. Joint ventures should use the resources and facilities of the arms and manufacturers to improve the international competitiveness of civilian industry in such areas as computer technologies, optics, communications, fibre textiles, ceramics and propellants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Using the arms industry's resources to improve the international competitiveness of industry as a whole, believe the pragmatists, will aid the process of moving away from weapons manufacturing. &quot;We don't believe that relying on arms exports is a viable long-term option, because the domestic base must shrink as demands for state resources increase from other areas,&quot; says Fanaroff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key to change, say the pragmatists, will be greater transparency and accountability within the arms industry. &quot;We believe that the boards of Armscor and Denel should democratised, in much the same way as is happening with other parastatals like Escom,&quot; he says, &quot;and that an independent regulatory body be formed to oversee the arms industry, with a similar makeup to the National Economic Forum.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Armscor's regulatory role is growing, says its new representative, Abba Omar, a former MK cadre who stressed that he was still speaking in his personal capacity. &quot;A tighter regime on arms exports should be the aim for the next four or five years. We must stick to UN embargos, and aim for a higher degree of public transparency on who is getting what from South Africa. We should also be giving some thought to limiting exports to areas of heightened tension.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> African National Congress economics spokesman Trevor Manuel distanced himself last week from attempts to incorporate into US legislation codes of conduct for businesses reinvesting in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel was speaking at a Weekly Mail and Guardian breakfast function to honour the winner of the newspaper's Investing in the Future Award, the Premier Group, and runners-up Mercedes Benz SA and Standard Bank.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel noted corporate conscience was sorely needed in South Africa, and how the ANC was grateful to the WM&amp;G Investing in the Future Review for focusing on the issue with the award.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He had just returned from a trip to the US, said Manuel, where he had had a difference of opinion with what he called good friends of the ANC on the attempt to incorporate into legislation a code of conduct for US companies reinvesting in South Africa.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;It took some explaining to tell them we in the colony would be OK&quot; and that there was some corporate conscience in South Africa, he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel spoke about the rating of social responsibility, and contrasted the experience of a plant in Atlantis where workers were deeply involved in the running of the company but which probably did not have a big corporate social responsibility budget with that of a mining house which had a big CSR budget but which had retrenched 164,000 workers between 1987 and 1992.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> How would one compare the social responsibility of this mining house with the Atlantis factory? he asked. Could a company like Thor Chemicals, he continued, even if it had a large chairman's fund, lifelong employment and worker participation ever make the grade?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was apparent relative weight of factors would shift with time and circumstances.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A question he posed was what kind of model should South Africa follow?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Should it follow the example of the United States with its myriad of foundations? Or Japanese companies and lifelong employment? Of the South Korean model, where government-aided winning companies contribute to the national advantage?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Does one fall closer to compliance with agreed norms, or reward innovation? Another question was how social responsibility was measured and by whom?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Manuel said that notwithstanding the perception of the ANC as an omnipotent organisation with policies covering everything, it did not have a defined policy on corporate social responsibility. He outlined some continuing considerations revisited from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the external environment, there were easily measured factors such as investing in deprived communities, separating social investment from normal marketing, and involving the community in decision-making about such investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Environmental concerns included the potential shift of hazardous industries to the underdeveloped world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Referring to what he said were South Africa's stultified markets, he said the challenge of taking on the oligopolies, expanding non-primary exports, and ensuring lower prices to combat inflation and give access to essential goods and services to the poor should be rewarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Internal issues included industrial relations, enlarging employment and training and retraining.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> National objectives were adding value non-primary exports, investment in research and development, affirmative action and expansion of employment opportunities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key question was how good a citizen was a particular corporation?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And the key challenge will be to &quot;give content to democracy&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A democratic government government cannot do it alone. We need partnerships with long-term vision that take account of the legacy and constraints a new government will face.&quot; Such partnerships would ensure South Africa's international competitiveness and the country's reintegration into the world economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Social responsibility programmes were an important part of such partnerships, he said.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Menongue, Angola -- This small outdoor market is one of the growing signs of life in this city in Angola's southeastern highlands.  The town has been under siege since the beginning of the year, and only in recent weeks has outside aid reached the beleaguered inhabitants.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Children run and play, vendors sell vegetables and small tins of cooking oil.  One booth is named the Pharmacy of Hope.  It has everything from a broken IV to amoxycillin and vitamins.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But few people can afford the prices here.  A handful of peanuts cost more thanan average day's pay.  A soldier looking for extra cash at the market surreptitiously offers to sell uranium and mercury to foreigners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The national government is trying to help rehabilitate Menongue.  The town's bank has reopened with newly arrived cash, and school is scheduled to begin on November 15th. But, as the city comes back to life, people here are still struggling against death.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Our first visit was to the hospital to get some sort of idea what sort of condition people were in,&quot; says Peter Middlemass, from the aid group Care International, which is helping provide assistance to Menongue. &quot;Since my days in Somalia and on the border of Thailand, I hadn't seen people in such bad condition -- andthat included both young children and adults, and all the wasted suffering fromsome form of malnutrition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Most of the nearly 400 patients here sleep on the hospital floors. About half are children.  Many show the telltale signs of malnutrition, such as swollen bellies and tuftsof reddish hair on their heads.  Among the adults are victims of land mines, other war injuries, and hunger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Typical among the patients is one 23-year-old woman who is lying on a hospital balcony.  As she sheltered her two starving babies under a blanket, she explainsthat until she recently began receiving food aid she had gone for four months, eating nothing but leaves.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dr. Agular Vicente is the hospital's only physician. He says not only is food ihort supply but medicine also has been scarce during the siege.  He has had to perform many amputations without anesthetics, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An energetic man with a nervous laugh, Dr. Vicente says thousands of injured and malnourished people have come through the hospital in the past nine month. Some 500 of them have died.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;This time the conditions are much worse -- two, three, or four times worse than before,&quot; says Dr. Vicente. More people have died in the last nine months of fighting than during the sixteen years of war that followed Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975, he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That conflict was halted by a United Nations-brokered peace accord in 1991 between the formerly oviet-backed government led by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the rebel movement known as UNITA, headed by Jonas Savimbi, which had beensupported by the United States. The country's first democratic elections were held just over a year ago, but fighting resumed after UNITA charged fraud and refused to accept defeat.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The United Nations estimates that at least 1,000 people are dyingdaily in Angola, but nobody knows for sure. Menongue is only one of a number of towns that have been under attack since the renewed outbreak of hostilities one year ago.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the run-up to the elections, the government left only 26 soldiers to guard the city.  When UNITA attacked, civilians -- some of them over 70 years old -- took up arms to help defend the town until government reinforcements arrived.  Still, Menongue was completely cut off for nine months, until fighting subsided enough for international aid flights to resume here last month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The guns are mostly silent now. One recent night, when journalists were visiting, a group of teenage boys held evening prayer services in the local Roman Catholic church.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Hope has returned with the arrival of food aid and outside help. But, nobody knows how long the food deliveries will continue.  UNITA still has the city surrounded, and peace talks have yet to produce a definitive end to the fighting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> UN negotiators plan to hold another round of talks this month in an effort to forge an agreement that can lead to lasting peace.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Washington, D.C. -- Unless an unexpected Congressional roadblock is removed this week, the United States could be left as the only country maintaining economic sanctions against South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the wake of Nelson Mandela's Sept. 24 speech to the United Nations calling for the international embargo to be lifted, restrictions on trade and investment have been removed by the European Community, the 50-member Commonwealth, the 51-nation Organization of African Unity, and the largest Asian economic powers, including China and Japan. The two biggest American cities, New York and Los Angeles, have repealed sanctions measures, as have several other local governments and state legislatures in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Michigan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But lack of action by the House of Representatives on a bipartisan measure passed by the Senate over six weeks ago threatens to keep U.S.  anti-apartheid legislation in force until next year. Supporters of sanctions repeal say that could stymie American assistance to South Africa during the crucial run-up to next April's elections and could damage U.S.  competitiveness in one of the world's top 25 emerging markets.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;With South Africa preparing for its first ever democratic vote but threatened with continuing violence, this is not a time for inaction,&quot; Harry Johnson, a Florida Democrat who chairs the Africa subcommittee warned last week.  A compromise is in the works, but legislative time is running out, with Congress moving rapidly towards adjournment before Thanksgiving.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although President Bush in 1991 lifted most of the sanctions enacted by the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act that Congress adopted over President Reagan's veto in 1986, current law still bars U.S. support for International Monetary Fund and World Bank lending to South Africa and limits the activities of the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S.  Export Import Bank in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On the day of Mandela's UN speech, a quick U.S. response to his appeal seemed likely as the Senate moved immediately to adopt sanction repeal legislation entitled the &quot;South African Democratic Transition Act of 1993.&quot; The Public Works, Banking and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House subsequently endorsed H.R. 3225. the House version of the bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the fourth and final House panel with jurisdiction over the matter, the powerful Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Dan Rostenkowski, has not acted -- for reasons having nothing to do with South Africa or the sanctions issue. According to Congressional aides, the Illinois Democrat does not want to send any bill to the Senate containing revenue-related provisions for fear it cld become what one Capitol Hill source termed &quot;a Christmas tree to which all kinds of unrelated measures could be attached.&quot; House and Senate parliamentarians have advised that a few sections of the sanctions bill could have potential revenue implications.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The delay in passage of what had been expected to be non-controversial legislation has alarmed Capitol Hill supporters of the legislation who believe this could signal American disinterest in South Africa at a critical political juncture and might discourage, at least temporarily, some of the American companies now considering post-apartheid investment and trade deals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A number of American firms are now poised for a move into South Africa, following a decade of withdrawals in response to escalating political confrontation in South Africa and domestic pressures in the United States.  &quot;South Africa is twice the size of our next largest market in Africa, Nigeria,&quot; Carl Ware, president of Coca-Cola's Africa Group, said in a recent interview. &quot;&quot;We are ready for reentry as soon as conditions are suitable.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> With so few days left before the Congressional session ends, supporters of sanctions repeal are worried. &quot;If the bill does not pass during this session,&quot; one frustrated Congressional staff member said, &quot;we will be debating it again in February or March when we should be focusing on support for the elections, not the old issue of sanctions.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To meet Rostenkowski's concerns, sections of the Senate-passed measure dealing with taxes and empowering the president to extend trade preferences to South Africa likely will be removed, the aides said. This may clear the way for House passage later this month.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The proposed compromise resulted from several days of campaigning by interested members from both Houses and lobbying by White House officials.  &quot;This is a real priority for us,&quot; one senior administration official said.  &quot;We didn't expect to encounter any problem since no one actually opposes passage.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> To try to insure the bill's adoption this year, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, the leading Republican sponsor of the legislation, telephone Rostenkowski and her Democratic co-sor, Paul Simon from Illinois, who chairs the Senate Africa subcommittee, asked thedministration to intervene and make its interest in adoption known. In the House, Johnston appealed for help from a Florida colleague and friend, Sam Gibbons, who chairs the Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, which endorsed the bill during a mark-up session on November 9.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although long-time sanctions advocates like the Congressional Black Caucus have joined in pressing for passage of the repeal measure, following the lead of the African National Congress, anti-apartheid forces have had mixed feelings about the wisdom of relinquishing economic leverage gained over years of legislative battles. Until recently, the ANC indicated an interest in linking the removal of sanctions to the adoption of a new &quot;code of conduct&quot; for foreign companies investing in South Africa but now opposes attaching any conditions to repeal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jennifer Davis, executive director of the New York- based American Committee on Africa, the oldest U.S. anti- apartheid organization, says her group favors language like that adopted by the Washington, D.C. Council in a non- binding resolution calling for &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; to invest in companies that adhere to a set of ANC &quot;guiding principles&quot; in their dealings with South Africa. &quot;This provides a form of pressure that may be useful when a company is mistreating its worrce or otherwise behaving very badly,&quot; she says. But few other municipalities or states have passage such a provision, and the bill before Congress would end the Code of Conduct requirements contained in the 1986 Anti-Apartheid Act, as soon as the president certifies that a nonracial, democratically elected government has taken office in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> While visiting the United States last month, Mandela put the emphasis on attracting foreign capital rather than regulating business activity. &quot;We have issued a code to protect investment,&quot; he told a conference of institutional investors in Washington, echoing earlier remarks before a gathering a corporate executives in New York. &quot;There will be no confiscation of property, &quot; he said, and the ANC is not going to adopt &quot;reckless&quot; policies that might drive business away.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For almost three decades a very nice little runner in the political and economic stakes, the dry, sprawling, diamond-rich social democracy is hitting a rough patch, and checking out its next step. Methaetsile Leepile tracks the political infights and the major players. Annabel Dunn looks at the economic options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things are not well within the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), the sacred cow of the country's politics. In power since independence 27 years ago, the party is paralyzed by power struggles between older members accustomed to the trappings of power, and the so-called newcomers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trouble in the BDP started early last year when a commission set up by the President, Sir Ketumile Masire, to investigate illegal land deals in Gaborone's hinterland exposed widespread corruption and abuse by people in high places. Two implicated by the Kgabo report were then Vice President, Local Government and Housing Minister and party chairman Peter Simako Mmusi, and Agriculture Minister and party secretary general Daniel Kwelagobe. Under pressure from colleagues and the press, they resigned both their party and cabinet positions. But they insisted they had done nothing wrong -- they were leaving the party &quot;to cleanse their names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both were in fact later absolved by a second enquiry, the Christie commission, led by a former Rhodesian high court judge, which investigated the Botswana Housing Corporation, a parastatal which fell under Mmusi.  However, the judge did say Mmusi should take political responsibility for the entire mess. They took the government to court, a move that precipitated their resignations from cabinet, and hardened the division within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwelagobe spent time mobilising support within national and local party structures throughout the country. He attacked his detractors -- led by archrival Major General Mompati Merafhe, Minister of Public Service -- as a bunch of power-hungry upstarts intent on destroying him and Mmusi. The BDP, he said in one of his famous diatribes, &quot;shall not be controlled as though it were a private company, by small bands of people...&quot; It later turned out that the cabal, dubbed &quot;The Big Five,&quot; wanted to prevent Kwelagobe and Mmusi from standing for central committee elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rest is history. At the July congress in Kanye, Kwelagobe and his faction swept up all but two of the ten available places and he and Mmusi were re-elected to their old positions. The other two places went to &quot;neutrals&quot; -- Vice President and Finance and Planning Minister Festus Mogae, and Commerce and Industry Minister Ponatshego Kedikilwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Merafhe faction, fearing a witchhunt, reportedly trooped to State House to prevail on the President to nominate their number to the remaining five slots. He did -- much to the chagrin of the Kwelagobe faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last Parliamentary sitting, the war of words between the two factions continued unabated. For the first time in many years the House, which is dominated by ruling party politicians, was split down the middle between supporters of Merafhe and Kwelagobe. Predictably, Kwelagobe tried to block a bill which seeks to make it possible for any Botswana, whether a citizen by birth or naturalisation, to acquire land anywhere in the country.  The Tribal Land (Amendment) Bill, which is a response to the Kgabo and Chrisitie reports, also seeks to eliminate the word &quot;tribe&quot; from the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Merafhe argues that while the government is trying to attract investors from other nationalities, some people want them to be denied citizenship.  &quot;Those who advocate the retention of the word 'tribesman'' have their own motives...,&quot; he said. He was referring to the so-called North-South divide inside the party which Kwelagobe exploited to the full at the congress. Many of the people elected in Kanye are from the south, while those rejected were by and large from the north. Merafhe seems convinced that Kwelagobe is fanning the tribal flames for purely political ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though basically cosmetic, both factions exploit the divide when it suits their egos. For instance in the runup to congress, BDP strongman Kwelagobe quoted from speeches by founding President Sir Sereste Khama, a northerner, when addressing committees from the north. This went down well -- even in death Sereste remains immensely popular. But Kwelagobe doesn't hesitate to label Merafhe and others in cabinet who control government as &quot;Sereste's appointees,&quot; because a number of ex-ministers in cahoots with him, including southerners Mmusi and former Assistant Local Government Minister Ronald Sebego, are no longer in government. Could Kwelagobe be implying that Sir Ketumile, a southerner, who succeeded Sir Seretse, is a &quot;northern boy&quot;?  The north-south divide has suddenly turned into a power struggle between government and party in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Merafhe group's fear is that the Kwelagobe faction will try to marginalise them in the coming elections. Kwelagobe, who didn't go very far in education (he did matric) is suspected of fearing the party newcomers, many of whom are affluent and educated. He likes to make the point that he was raised in the party, with nearly three decades as a party worker, building it into the powerful machine it is today. But as one of the &quot;newcomers,&quot; Local Government Minister Chapston Butale said, he's been a party member since 1969, when Kwelagobe was in his early teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwelagobe, critics argue, thinks he was born to lead the BDP -- &quot;he treats the party as if it were his backyard,&quot; confided one insider. &quot;He has flooded party structures with his lackeys. Now they control the central committee. The next thing they will rig primary elections.&quot; (The central committee has the final say on people elected in the primaries).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is said that for a long time Mmusi and Kwelagobe -- and even Masire -- surrounded themselves with &quot;praise singers.&quot; In the runup to congress a pro-Merafhe source told the writer, &quot;No one dared challenge the trio, their word was law. But that is no more.&quot; He feared Kwelagobe. &quot;He is good with the people... He would be alright as Minister of Agriculture... but I shudder to think of that man becoming president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwelagobe has become so confident that he now publicly criticises government policies, and the President. It was widely believed that after congress the duo would withdraw their case. It was postponed but not withdrawn. The President told delegates at Kanye that he &quot;begged and pleaded with them&quot; to withdraw, but they refused. Observers have interpreted this as implying that the President was tacitly admitting that the party and government had wronged Kwelagobe and Mmusi in suspending them. The party has since given the two a vote of confidence. Clearly, Kwelagobe is out to erode Masire's power, and if Masire still has any pretensions to State House, he would be better off taking the fight to Kwelagobe than to keep begging to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The interim Bill of Rights finalised this week will open up exciting new opportunities for all sorts of social and environmental activities, argues Anton Harber.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When you are arrested in the future South Africa, a policeman will be obliged to read you your rights -- much as we see in American soap-operas and sitcoms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And no longer will state officials, from passport issuers to stamp sellers, be able to make decisions that affect your life without giving you reasons -- and good ones too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These are just two of the hidden elements in the draft Fundamental Rights chapter of the new constitution due to be finalised at the World Trade Centre this week. Most South Africans are not even aware of it, but the Bill creates a whole range of new rights that will fundamentally affect many lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For example, the Bill gives every citizen the right to be furnished with reasons for administrative action which affects them (a passport refusal, a detention order, refusal of a military camp call-up ...) and those reasons have to be justified.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This gives ordinary people enormous scope to challenge actions by faceless and previously unaccountable bureaucrats.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Bill is wide-ranging, covering everything from gender equality and the rights of detainees to the rights of children. It opens up whole new areas of activism for South Africans. As one small example, it includes the right not to be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of one's sexual preferences. This clause will empower gay activists far more than most constitutions do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It also gives &quot;every person ... the right to an environment which is not detrimental to his or her health or well-being,&quot; giving new clout to environmental lobbyists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And, for the first time, South African law will allow for class or group actions, the basis on which activist and lobby groups have been able to use the courts in countries like the USA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Our Bill has little of the clear and ringing language of its international equivalents. Now in its 11th draft, it is the result of complex and lengthy negotiation and is therefore often messy, convoluted and opaque.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So, the sanctity of private property was qualified by the African National Congress' desire to allow for restitution to people who were deprived of their property under apartheid, and that has in turn been qualified by others who fear the abuse of such redistributive rights. The result is a jurisprudential nightmare, a cocktail of ideas and equivocation that makes no one happy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Nevertheless, the Bill of Rights will protect and empower all sorts of individuals and institutions previously attacked by the state. Universities will have their academic freedom entrenched; detainees will be protected against abuse; minority language groups will enjoy the right to their choice of language and cultural life; everyone will have freedom of movement, association and expression; no one can be deprived of their citizenship; education becomes a universal right, not a privilege.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In other instances, the negotiators have ducked difficult policy issues.  The Bill guarantees an unequivocal right to life, but is silent on whether this prevents abortion or capital punishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Lawyers are divided on what this means. The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Nic Corbett, has said he believes this precludes abortion. Others, such as Professor Dennis Davis of Wits University and Tony Leon of the Democratic Party, says it will not stop the aborting of an unviable foetus, such as in the first trimester of a pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We will be caught into the same debate as the US Supreme Court, in which our constitutional court will have to determine what constitutes &quot;life&quot; and when a foetus is &quot;living.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Other issues remain unclear. To what extent does the freedom of expression clause allow censorship of, say, pornography? Legal experts say it will allow the Publications Control Board to continue to work, but with significantly fewer powers and greater accountability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> All of these, however, are matters of interpretation, so the critical issue is who will do the interpreting; in other words, how will the extremely powerful constitutional court judges be chosen?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This remains a subject of controversy. The latest proposal is that, unlike ordinary judges who will be chosen by a special judicial commission made up of their peers and experts, the judges in the highest court of the land will be chosen by the multi-party cabinet.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some experts argue that this leaves this decision in the hands of horse-trading politicians, it weakens the court as a counterbalance to parliament and it will favour bland and mediocre judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Others, however, say that this will give the court greater credibility.  To leave it to a judicial commission will mean white, male judges will make the choice -- and they will inevitably lean toward white, male judges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a critical issue, for issues as important as capital punishment, abortion and censorship will depend on how wise, just, fair, legally competent and credible these individuals are.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For almost three decades a very nice little runner in the political and economic stakes, the dry, sprawling, diamond-rich social democracy is hitting a rough patch, and checking out its next step. Methaetsile Leepile tracks the political infights and the major players. Annabel Dunn looks at the economic options.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Things are not well within the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP), the sacred cow of the country's politics. In power since independence 27 years ago, the party is paralyzed by power struggles between older members accustomed to the trappings of power, and the so-called newcomers.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Trouble in the BDP started early last year when a commission set up by the President, Sir Ketumile Masire, to investigate illegal land deals in Gaborone's hinterland exposed widespread corruption and abuse by people in high places. Two implicated by the Kgabo report were then Vice President, Local Government and Housing Minister and party chairman Peter Simako Mmusi, and Agriculture Minister and party secretary general Daniel Kwelagobe. Under pressure from colleagues and the press, they resigned both their party and cabinet positions. But they insisted they had done nothing wrong -- they were leaving the party &quot;to cleanse their names.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Both were in fact later absolved by a second enquiry, the Christie commission, led by a former Rhodesian high court judge, which investigated the Botswana Housing Corporation, a parastatal which fell under Mmusi.  However, the judge did say Mmusi should take political responsibility for the entire mess. They took the government to court, a move that precipitated their resignations from cabinet, and hardened the division within the party.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwelagobe spent time mobilising support within national and local party structures throughout the country. He attacked his detractors -- led by archrival Major General Mompati Merafhe, Minister of Public Service -- as a bunch of power-hungry upstarts intent on destroying him and Mmusi. The BDP, he said in one of his famous diatribes, &quot;shall not be controlled as though it were a private company, by small bands of people...&quot; It later turned out that the cabal, dubbed &quot;The Big Five,&quot; wanted to prevent Kwelagobe and Mmusi from standing for central committee elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rest is history. At the July congress in Kanye, Kwelagobe and his faction swept up all but two of the ten available places and he and Mmusi were re-elected to their old positions. The other two places went to &quot;neutrals&quot; -- Vice President and Finance and Planning Minister Festus Mogae, and Commerce and Industry Minister Ponatshego Kedikilwe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Merafhe faction, fearing a witchhunt, reportedly trooped to State House to prevail on the President to nominate their number to the remaining five slots. He did -- much to the chagrin of the Kwelagobe faction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In the last Parliamentary sitting, the war of words between the two factions continued unabated. For the first time in many years the House, which is dominated by ruling party politicians, was split down the middle between supporters of Merafhe and Kwelagobe. Predictably, Kwelagobe tried to block a bill which seeks to make it possible for any Botswana, whether a citizen by birth or naturalisation, to acquire land anywhere in the country.  The Tribal Land (Amendment) Bill, which is a response to the Kgabo and Chrisitie reports, also seeks to eliminate the word &quot;tribe&quot; from the Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Merafhe argues that while the government is trying to attract investors from other nationalities, some people want them to be denied citizenship.  &quot;Those who advocate the retention of the word 'tribesman'' have their own motives...,&quot; he said. He was referring to the so-called North-South divide inside the party which Kwelagobe exploited to the full at the congress. Many of the people elected in Kanye are from the south, while those rejected were by and large from the north. Merafhe seems convinced that Kwelagobe is fanning the tribal flames for purely political ends.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Though basically cosmetic, both factions exploit the divide when it suits their egos. For instance in the runup to congress, BDP strongman Kwelagobe quoted from speeches by founding President Sir Sereste Khama, a northerner, when addressing committees from the north. This went down well -- even in death Sereste remains immensely popular. But Kwelagobe doesn't hesitate to label Merafhe and others in cabinet who control government as &quot;Sereste's appointees,&quot; because a number of ex-ministers in cahoots with him, including southerners Mmusi and former Assistant Local Government Minister Ronald Sebego, are no longer in government. Could Kwelagobe be implying that Sir Ketumile, a southerner, who succeeded Sir Seretse, is a &quot;northern boy&quot;?  The north-south divide has suddenly turned into a power struggle between government and party in Parliament.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Merafhe group's fear is that the Kwelagobe faction will try to marginalise them in the coming elections. Kwelagobe, who didn't go very far in education (he did matric) is suspected of fearing the party newcomers, many of whom are affluent and educated. He likes to make the point that he was raised in the party, with nearly three decades as a party worker, building it into the powerful machine it is today. But as one of the &quot;newcomers,&quot; Local Government Minister Chapston Butale said, he's been a party member since 1969, when Kwelagobe was in his early teens.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwelagobe, critics argue, thinks he was born to lead the BDP -- &quot;he treats the party as if it were his backyard,&quot; confided one insider. &quot;He has flooded party structures with his lackeys. Now they control the central committee. The next thing they will rig primary elections.&quot; (The central committee has the final say on people elected in the primaries).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is said that for a long time Mmusi and Kwelagobe -- and even Masire -- surrounded themselves with &quot;praise singers.&quot; In the runup to congress a pro-Merafhe source told the writer, &quot;No one dared challenge the trio, their word was law. But that is no more.&quot; He feared Kwelagobe. &quot;He is good with the people... He would be alright as Minister of Agriculture... but I shudder to think of that man becoming president.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kwelagobe has become so confident that he now publicly criticises government policies, and the President. It was widely believed that after congress the duo would withdraw their case. It was postponed but not withdrawn. The President told delegates at Kanye that he &quot;begged and pleaded with them&quot; to withdraw, but they refused. Observers have interpreted this as implying that the President was tacitly admitting that the party and government had wronged Kwelagobe and Mmusi in suspending them. The party has since given the two a vote of confidence. Clearly, Kwelagobe is out to erode Masire's power, and if Masire still has any pretensions to State House, he would be better off taking the fight to Kwelagobe than to keep begging to him.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda, Angola - Joao Batista, hungry for the grains of rice falling from bags of food aid onto the tarmac, threw himself under the white belly of the cargo plane with uncanny grace for someone who was drunk and has only one leg.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He was taking care not to shatter wine bottle he had tied inside the bottom of his empty pant leg to free his hands for stuffing rice into his oily pockets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Batista, 30, is a former foot soldier for the Angolan army. His leg was blown off by a land mine and now he wanders the streets of the capital in his frayed military fatigues, a ghost of Angola's seemingly endless war. He and thousands like him are the mirror image of this teeming city that has become a filthy haven for lost, hungry and crippled souls since fighting resumed one year ago.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The population of Luanda -- a seaside city once known as the Rio de Janeiro of Africa -- has increased by 40 percent in the past year as people flee fighting and famine in the interior.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the estimated 600,000 refugees find little respite here, where inflation has hit 1,300 percent. As a result, the number of severely malnourished people in the city has doubled what it was five months ago, says Manuel da Silva, who heads the United Nations relief operation in Angola.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''We are getting concerned that this is increasing very fast,'' he says.  ''It's very significant. The different aid agencies are getting very worried, including the World Bank, and people are trying to find means and plans of action to address this situation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> International aid groups working in Angola have focused most of their attention on besieged cities in the interior where tens of thousands of people have died since fighting broke out in October last year after UNITA rebels rejected losing the southern African country's first democratic elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The health care of Luandans has not been a priority with the government.  It dedicated only 0.3 percent of its budget this year to health, according to Ana Liria-Franch with the UN. High Commissioner for Refugees in Luanda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The government's communications minister, Pedro Vall Neto, denies the government is not carrying out economic reforms that could help the impoverished and says it is trying to develop ''a liberal type of economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''In England, America, in France -- all over the world it is like that.  If you have your money you buy it, luxury or not, you buy it because you have the money to do it. If you don't have the money to do it you don't buy it because you can't,'' he says. ''If we start controlling that type of buying, how is the Western world going to react? They will be saying that we are going back to controlling the people again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Joao Bondo, his wife and six children are typical among those in Luanda with little buying power. He was a civil servant in the northern town of Uige with a comfortable life until fighting broke out. Here, he has no job and the family relies on the income of his wife who sells small items such as beer and biscuits on the street.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''When we have enough we eat three meals a day, breakfast, lunch and supper,'' says Bondo, 40. ''When we don't have enough we try to conserve by only eating supper. We didn't have this situation in Uige.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Luanda's infrastructure was built to support about 400,000 people, not the 2.8 million who live here now. Those who do have jobs can hardly make a living.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the Textang fabric mill, workers earn an average of 450,000 kwanzas per month, which is about $8 at the current black market rate. But even they could be out of a job within the next year. ''We are at 10 percent of production capacity,'' says Humberto Domingos da Costa, general director of Angola's industries. ''But we are still a bit satisfied because there aren't many factories in Angola that still function. But we do.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Da Costa says he often trades kwanzas on the black market to obtain the dollars he needs to buy spare parts for his machines. ''We are a state company, but we don't depend on the state to function,'' he says.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Some of the massive green textile machines look as though workers went on their lunch break and never returned. Bolts of cloth are in mid-thread and a fuzzy, gray dust covers the machinery in a cotton cocoon, as if preserving them for the day when Luanda comes back to life.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Aid workers say the situation in Luanda will likely get worse before it gets better.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The rainy season is about to begin and is expected to bring a cholera epidemic with it that health workers fear will infect more than 1,000 people per week by next spring. Cholera exists in the city's piped water system, which is often unchlorinated, as well as in open sewers and streams that cut through the shantytowns.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> ''It's just going to be horrific in January, February and March'' as the epidemic peaks, says Peter Hawkins, who represents the British-based aid group Save the Children Fund in Angola. ''You have a very fit child in the morning who would be dead by the evening.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Harare, Zimbabwe - Charles Msipa is bullish on Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At a time when many outsiders view the continent's prospects as dismal, the 28-year-old businessman typifies a new breed of African entrepreneurs who expect an economic boom in the wake of widespread political reforms. Trained in international law, Msipa left a promising career in a London bank to become external affairs manager in southern Africa for Coca-Cola, which has created a new Africa division and is aggressively expanding in African countries.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There really is a sense of revitalization and of empowerment of people going on all around Africa,&quot; Msipa said. &quot;There's an air that things are changing and changing for the better, and people are feeling that they can participate more actively and contribute more.&quot;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since 1989, democracy movements have forced multiparty elections or limits to executive power in more than two dozen African countries. Along with political pluralism have come economic reforms that are making African countries more hospitable to private enterprise.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> An additional element of the buoyant mood is the widespread belief that post-apartheid South Africa will become the engine that drives the continent's economic recovery.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Earlier this month, 20 eastern and southern African countries signed an agreement to establish a common market by the year 2000, in an area with a population of 270 million people and a gross domestic product of as much as $200 billion. South Africa, participating for the first time in an African summit, said it will join the group after establishing a transitional government in elections scheduled for next April.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Kenyan publisher Evelyn Mungai, who is vice chair of the fledgling African Business Roundtable, a forum of African business leaders, applauded the treaty as a boost for economic expansion throughout the region. &quot;There is now a larger market for all of us,&quot; she said. &quot;There is enormous opportunity for intra-regional trade and enterprise development.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But despite their optimism, some business leaders predict that stereotypes about Africa may limit the role American companies play in Africa's renewal, and they fear that the growth of African economies will be slowed as a result. The emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe may edge out Africa in the competition for investment dollars, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Easom Alintah, a Nigerian who is secretary general of the Roundtable, believes that the export needs of American industry ought to be fueling a rush towards Africa's new markets. &quot;There is money to be made in Africa,&quot; Alintah said during one of his trips to promote the Roundtable's agenda of policy reforms and international partnerships. &quot;There is absolutely no reason why a U.S. business that approaches Africa with the same diligence with which it operates domestically shouldn't make a profit.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alintah argued that Africa already is more important commercially to the United States than is commonly recognized. His country, Nigeria, supplies more than twice as much crude oil to the United States as Kuwait and Iraq combined prior to Desert Storm. &quot;And you went to war for that,&quot; he said. By contrast, he noted, Nigeria's current political crisis is barely noticed in the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> U.S. Commerce Department statistics show that the volume of trade with Africa is more than three times as large as trade with all of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Although U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa grew 12% last year, some analysts say that is only a fraction of the potential increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;There is less interest in Africa around here than is warranted by the opportunities,&quot; said a Commerce Department aide who didn't want to be identified. &quot;You don't hear the kind of talk about African countries that you do about Hungary or Poland, for example.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That may be changing. In remarks at the formal opening of the African Business Roundtable's Washington office in September, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said he intends to play a part in &quot;breaking the shackles of cynicism&quot; about Africa's future. &quot;As Secretary of Commerce,&quot; he said, &quot;I am absolutely committed to making sure that Africa is ignored no more.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Brown leaves for South Africa on Friday with a delegation of two dozen business leaders. Department officials said the trip reflects growing awareness of Africa among U.S. firms. Last month in Washington, nearly 500 people, twice as many as predicted, paid $500 each to attend a one-day conference on investing in South Africa sponsored by Global Business Access, a private group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Among those traveling with Brown will be Equitable Senior Vice President Frank Savage, who chairs the company's investment firm, Alliance Capital Management, which has launched a southern Africa capital fund that aims to put hundreds of millions of dollars into the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savage recently visited Zimbabwe, where he said he has found the openness of government officials encouraging. &quot;The serious capital pool for development in Africa is private, not government,&quot; he said, &quot;and I don't think there's any question that Africans recognize that. They're also aware that it's crunch time for Africa, and that they either have to make further changes or be locked into the world's economic basement.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Savage is one of a growing group of African American business executives who are promoting Africa as a field of expansion for U.S. companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Justin Beckett of New Africa Ventures, an assets management firm headquartered in Durham, North Carolina, said investors who make the move into Africa now will be positioned to reap the largest profits from the continent's newly unfettered economies. New Africa is forming institutional and retail funds to invest in small, black-owned enterprises in South Africa as well as in companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The real opportunities are in countries of the world that are still developing,&quot; Beckett said. &quot;And Africans are ready to be a part of that process. When I went to Russia recently, I found a lot of people who didn't even know what a check was. In west Africa, there were people who would take my check on the street. I saw sophisticated financial transactions by people who can't afford an office but who have the education and the energy to succeed. What they need is capital.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Beckett said New Africa intends to use South Africa, with its developed infrastructure and lively stock market, as a springboard to the rest of the continent, and he predicts other investors will do the same.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not everyone is as sanguine about the impact of South Africa's new status on its neighbors. Earlier this month James Rawlings, a former U.S.  ambassador to Zimbabwe and chairman of the Zimbabwe/U.S. Business Council, told the Zimbabwe Financial Gazette that the group will suspend its activities in the face of competition from South Africa for investor interest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Msipa, like other Africans interviewed, welcomes South Africa's integration into continental affairs. &quot;Certainly South Africa's economy is much bigger and the industrial capacity much higher,&quot; he said, &quot;but I think companies and businesses in the region will learn to be competitive and will find gaps where they can complement what is done by South African companies.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> According to a recent report by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, that trend is already apparent. The study of southern African economies cited Zimbabwe's private sector for efficient management and forward-looking investment schemes tied to market demand. It also noted that, unlike the public sector, which has suffered a brain drain of skilled labor through emigration, the business community is becoming a model for utilizing indigenous skills and for technological development.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Msipa said another significant development is the changing African attitude towards foreign investment. He said the once-prevalent view that foreign companies are undesirable exploiters is being edged out by the recognition that investment generates the jobs that are essential to prosperity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Citing Coca-Cola Africa as an example, Msipa said the company employs 40,000 people directly, but that its investments create hundreds of thousands of additional jobs through nationwide networks of suppliers and vendors, from glass manufacturers and graphic artists to sidewalk entrepreneurs and rural traders. More than 500,000 pieces of advertising, such as billboards, need to be updated or repainted every year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Msipa said his own country is representative of the problems facing African governments, which, since independence, have done better at providing schooling than at stimulating economic growth. Zimbabwe has been described as having the world's most educated, unemployed work force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;The single biggest factor that has brought this government to implementing reform programs,&quot; said Msipa, &quot;is the dilemma of how to meet the aspirations that have been created by providing education for these young people.&quot; Zimbabwe recently reduced capital gains taxes and introduced full repatriation of capital and dividends, with further reforms scheduled to take effect in January.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But Msipa concedes that bureaucratic and regulatory barriers still discourage investment, in Zimbabwe and elsewhere. &quot;Most African countries are trying to reduce the role of government and increase the participation of the private sector,&quot; he said, &quot;but there is a gap between acceptance in theory and actually putting into place the policies that will attract the required level of investment.&quot; He said countries with the most favorable investment policies, like Namibia, will be the greatest beneficiaries of the growing interest in Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Alintah agrees, arguing that too many African rulers continue to resist demands for accountable, efficient government. &quot;Politicians think the public is more naive than it really is,&quot; he said, predicting that Nigeria faces serious social unrest as well as economic decline unless its military rulers proceed with democratic reforms that were suspended in June. &quot;The only thing that has rescued the country up to this point is the strength of the private sector,&quot; he said. &quot;But we can't provide the stable climate investors want without political order.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Still, Alintah argues, foreign firms who seek out knowledgeable African partners can do well, even in difficult conditions, just as Nigerian businesses have done. It is the growing number of Africans who are willing to invest in their own countries rather than sending their money abroad, he said, that will persuade foreign investors of Africa's potential.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Evelyn Mungai shares that view. &quot;The private sector is the key to a very bright future,&quot; she said, arguing that African attitudes about pursuing careers in business are undergoing a fundamental change. &quot;In the past,&quot; she said, &quot;people sought security in the public sector. They saw business as something you do when you retire. Now the reverse is becoming true, and the dynamism of private enterprise is going to transform Africa.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> One of the most talked of failures in African politics is the dismal record that the continent's political leadership has when it comes to conflict resolution and peace making.  One could be forgiven for thinking that Africa has lost its way, or somehow lacks leadership and statesmen, when considering that half the world's conflicts are happening on that continent.  Where is the political machinery for dealing with Africa's conflicts?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Organisation for African Unity (OAU), Africa's political club of governments, behaves rather strangely when it comes to conflicts.  Towards the end of 1993, two years after regional conflict resolution and regional intervention had become the norm and not the exception,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">the OAU Charter's cardinal chapter is still: the infallibility of colonial borders and non-interference in the internal affairs of member states.  These are the OAU's guiding principles which now look severely outdated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The OAU is a casual spectator in Angola, Mozambique, Liberia and Somalia.  The international community has seen fit to intervene in these countries, but not the OAU. Other conflicts where the world has yet to intervene, such as that in Sudan, are untouchable for the OAU.  This is surprising, considering that Sudan's civil war is now Africa's oldest conflict and a recent study said that 1.3 million Southern Sudanese civilians had died war-related deaths over the past ten years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now it does, at last, seem as if there is an African regional organisation prepared to take the lead in conflict resolution.  The Inter-Governmental Authority for Desertification and Development (IGADD), which links together Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Sudan, has established a committee to mediate an end to the civil war in Sudan.  The committee comprises of the heads of state of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda, and is being chaired by the Kenyan president, Daniel arap Moi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> So far the four leaders have taken their task seriously and have set about fact finding amongst the belligerents.  Both factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) were invited during November to meet the committee in Kampala, Uganda, during the summit meeting of the Preferential Trade Area (PTA), held between the 4th and 6th of November.  Lieutenant General El Beshir attended the PTA meeting in his own right as head of the Khartoum regime and a member state.  Meeting separately with the committee, all parties to the conflict reaffirmed their wish to co-operate with it in the search for peace.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is difficult to raise too much hope of success in a conflict as intractable as that of Sudan, especially when both the credibility and the sincerity of many of the Sudanese players is in serious doubt.  However, the fact that the four African leaders have found it important to publicly commit themselves to a peace effort in Sudan is a helpful sign for the long suffering people of the country and is also an encouraging development for Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is noteworthy that the presidents of Eritrea and Ethiopia, who have only recently seen the liberation of their own countries, should get involved in conflict resolution in Sudan.  They have immense domestic problems to deal with as they set about building democracy and democratic institutions at home, without the need to burden themselves with the problems of Sudan.  However, there are undoubtedly many lessons that all parties to the Sudanese conflict can learn from these young and energetic leaders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Gazette also wishes to acknowledge and applaud the efforts of friends of Sudan who have recently kept the people's plight high on the international political agenda.  A list of all these people, humanitarian organisations and governments would take up the whole newsletter, but two in particular need to be singled out for special mention.  They are Congressman Harry Johnston, Chairperson of the US House of Representative Subcommittee on Africa, and Congressman Frank Wolf.  Their tireless campaign on behalf of the poor of Sudan is only matched by the vehemence with which they have been denounced and pilloried by the repressive Islamic Fundamentalist military regime in Khartoum.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Now that an African regional peace initiative has been launched by the IGADD committee, we hope that all those who are concerned and active in the interests of peace in Sudan will co-operate and co-ordinate with and assist this new peace effort, so that a swift resolution can be achieved.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There has been, in recent weeks, a series of articles that have appeared in a Johannesburg daily newspaper under the anonymous authorship of &quot;Johannesburg journalist&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In sum the articles have distilled the major problems confronting the diversification, and by extension, the democratisation of the press in South Africa.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I am not quite sure why &quot;Johannesburg journalist&quot; has decided to write anonymously because the points the author makes are valid and even critical to the transformation process we are going through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The kernel of the argument contained in the articles is that the control of newspapers, which is in the hands of a few, makes nonsense of the argument of freedom of the press because it raises the trenchant question -- what freedom? and for whom?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The country's print media has over the past three years dispensed generous doses of advice on the demerits of the liberation movements' different policy formulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By far the most memorable being the hysteria over the prospect of a policy of nationalisation by an ANC government.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is true of course that it is the function of media to mirror the social reality and to highlight the hopes and fears of ordinary people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Yet, the South African press, as a mirror of society, has looked at everything else, but itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Recently numerous seminars have been held to reflect on the question of freedom of the press, and often the focus of such talks is to get political guarantees that a new government will not temper with freedom of the press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This assumes that indeed such freedom exists, in the first place, and that by the very nature of freedom, it is enjoyed by all equally. Freedom of the press is irrevocably linked to ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this country press ownership is exclusively white, in a market that is dominated by black consumers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most critical question about media freedom must therefore surely centre around ownership because it is the final repository of power and policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The attempt to depoliticise what is probably the most politicised institution is rather a fuss.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is the argument that party-owned newspapers are limited in scope because they advance a narrow party political line. Which is true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> That line of logic should then be extended to say that similarly , a press that is exclusively owned by a minority white elite will likewise propagate the values of that class.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Politics, in other words, is not the sole preserve of political organisations and politicians. On the contrary, some of the most significant political agents in the country are major business companies.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And it is particularly true for the rest of the Western world that those who shape political policy are not themselves politicians but business people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In South Africa, the two biggest conglomerates, Anglo American and Sanlam have respectively been tied to the Progressive Party (in all its phases of gestation) and to the National Party. These two companies together own 95 percent of all print media in this country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By far the biggest consumers of newspapers are black people, yet this is not reflected in the ownership relations. One is not arguing that black ownership will in itself reflect the democratisation of media, but it will at the very least reflect accessibility to ownership.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In spite of the English press' long history of opposing the excesses of apartheid rule, it has been most resistant to change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The National Party, which it has attacked with missionary zeal over the past four decades, has been rapidly conceding power, authority and privilege. And the plenary session at the World Trade Centre this week formalised the beginning of the orderly transfer of power from a white minority to the black majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This symbolised, in a sense, the strategic move by Afrikaners to commit group suicide in order to retain some influence, and not an entirely insignificant one, in a government of national unity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Their perspective is informed by a sharp instinct of survival. It lies in the recognition that there has been a fundamental and irreversible shift from voting for the tribe to voting for the common good.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Afrikaners have had to come to terms with the reality of their Africanness in a way that the more privileged English have never had to.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The practice that attempted to shut out possibilities of Afrikaners having a meaningful control of media, and a significant stake in the economy when the National Party came to power in 1948 -- has once more arisen in the current situation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The resistance to opening up media ownership, thus guaranteeing a genuine voice for the majority, may lead to intervention by a new government that believes it needs its own voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Government or party owned newspapers are to be avoided at all costs, since they tend to servily glorify party leadership instead of informing the mass of the people what the major debates of the day are.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But in a situation where all major media is owned, if you like, by hostile forces, there is every justification for government intervention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The owners of these media understand how critically important they are in influencing society, and it is for this reason that the control of these newspapers is retained for political objectives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This monopoly of the press thus means that there is less, and not more press freedom. Ownership of media cannot be divorced from the practice of a free press.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press is not value neutral, it absorbs information from society and decides how best to disseminate it. In our experience, the interests of media owners have generally informed how much people know.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The press is a collective mobiliser as well as being a vehicle that enables different communities to exchange experiences. In this respect the press can become a critical tool for transformation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The most effective way of securing freedom of the press is not through seeking political guarantees, but through the diversification of media -- in terms of views and of ownership.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There was no dawn broadcast. No dusk-to-dawn curfew. No martial music.  No take-over of radio stations. No closure of airports and seaports. No shut-down of telephone lines. No tanks rolling in the streets. No tell- tale signs of a coup. But that was what it was. The generals had on Wednesday, November 17, imposed themselves, once again, on this unhappy country.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But the people are not breaking into song and dance, for this coup was totally uncalled for although some wrong-headed fellows had, in their desperation, called for it. True, there had been a general uncertainty in the land since June 23 when former President Ibrahim Babangida peremptorily scratched off the June 12 presidential election which, by popular admission, was free, fair and peaceful. But the country still had a fighting chance of keeping the generals at bay if Ernest Shonekan, the man who stepped in as Babangida stepped aside, had been given the chance to tackle the problems.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> For Shonekan, there was not even a day's honeymoon, as he was pounded from all sides, sometimes below the belt, by the press, his tribesmen and his detractors. All of these body blows had the cumulative effect of diminishing his ability to govern, reducing his government to a lame duck. Shonekan himself apparently believed in turning the other cheek, and not in counter-punching, a somewhat naive policy of appeasement. Perhaps in some distant date, Shonekan will stand at the podium and receive a medal as the most tolerant ruler in history but for now he can be dismissed as an 82-day wonder, as the man who had power dropped on his laps but who did not know what to do with it. And he is hereby dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> However, Moshood Abiola, the man who won the annulled election, cannot be so dismissed. Apart from a few gaffes (&quot;Nigeria will be turned into something more bloody than Bosnia and Somalia rolled into one;&quot; &quot;I'm larger than the party&quot;), Abiola scores full marks for fighting a good fight. In the campaign for the restoration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">of the election, he tried every trick in the book: confrontation (&quot;Shonekan's government is a bastard&quot;); conciliation (meetings with Tony Anenih, Arthur Nzeribe and Shehu Yar'Adua); and flattery (Abacha's &quot;common sense, experience, tact and intellect&quot;). He apparently bowed to the popular saying that &quot;flattery will get you anywhere,&quot; but it did not get him anywhere.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fight that Abiola conducted was, at a personal level, his fight, the fight to be the president of Nigeria; but at a higher level, it was our own fight. The fight for the just sharing of political and economic power in Nigeria, the fight for the soul of Nigeria. Abiola must have paid a high price in waging this war but he succeeded in raising our consciousness, in bringing our problems into bold relief. I dare say that in future no one will be able to casually wipe off the will of the people without a thought for the repercussions. To Abiola, this may be cold comfort but it can be said that be accomplished that for Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And what have those who requested for a coup accomplished for Nigeria?  A coup. The man in dark glasses has done them the favour. It's the height of naivety for these pro-coup democratic activists, is that not a contradiction in terms, to have thought that if June 12 was the question a coup was the answer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What the coup lobbyists didn't realise is that if sugar is sweet, and money is sweeter, power is sweetest. As Henry Kissinger put it, &quot;power is the ultimate aphrodisiac.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It ought to have occurred to them that anyone who decided to put his life on the line and execute a coup would most likely keep the power acquired rather than hand it over to someone else. Abacha has proved it. He has not</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">handed it to :Abiola. As things are now, the only post that Abiola can hold; in the Abacha government is FHS (Friend of the Head of State), which is still many notches</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">away from the one he coveted: president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And with the assimilation by osmosis of Baba Gana Kingibe, Abiola's running mate in the election, into the military government as the minister of external affairs, June 12 has come to a sorry end. In fact, in Abacha 's brief-as-a-mini-skirt speech on taking over, June 12 appeared only once in a parenthetical reference to the problems that provided him with the excuse to intrude on our consciousness.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Although there has been no articulate and ground- shaking opposition to the return of the military, Abacha must not misjudge the mood of the nation. It is not for the love of the military that there has been this sold sound of silence. It is simply evidence that the flaccidity of Shonekan's government and the interminable uncertainty may have driven them to the point of exasperation and resignation. It is a situation of interim numbness from which they will soon recover to reclaim their right to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Abacha has given himself a tall agenda. He wants to reorganise and reform all the wayward institutions. He may be a tough soldier but I can swear that all the problems of those institutions cannot be swept away with the wave of his swagger stick during the very brief period that he must stay at Aso Rock. All he should do is do what he can and quit. Those problems will outlast him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Also, he talked about a constitutional conference to determine the future constitutional structure of Nigeria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The fault, I dare say, is not within the leaves of the constitution.  Britain doesn't even have a written constitution but the system works. We tried the parliamentary system in the 1960s and failed. America's presidential constitution works only because they want it to work. How can ours work when soldiers are always at the door waving a smoking gun?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> We are sick and tired of &quot;military messiahs.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Watch this trio: Popo Molefe, Terror Lekota and Ketso Gordhan. All former mass democratic movement activists, they are now running the African National Congress Elections Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This department, which will essentially run the ANC show in the buildup to the April ballot, has become an enclave of former United Democratic Front activists who are bringing to bear their old mobilising and organising abilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> These three are old hands at UDF campaigns to get people to boycott the ballot, and they know how to get picketers to the voting stations. They have never tried the same with voters. But if the first two elements of their campaign for the April election are anything to go (by, they are men to watch.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The first phase of their campaign centres on &quot;people's forums&quot;. Nelson Mandela and other tripartite alliance leaders travel to public meetings around the country to invite communities to raise their concerns and to listen to them. It is foremost a listening -- and not a speaking -- tour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This approach builds on two ANC strengths: Mandela's personal stature, and the traditional image of the ANC as a &quot;parliament of the people&quot;, a broadly-based organisation that represents a diverse mass constituency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The negotiations process has damaged the latter image, with many traditional ANC supporters feeling that the organisation has neglected basic voter demands in the rush for a settlement. For some, the initials &quot;ANC&quot; have become associated more with cocktail parties than with people's parties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC's strategy recognises this alienation. It acknowledges that there are many potential ANC voters who are disgruntled for some or other reason (because Winnie Mandela was booted out of office, or because she wasn't booted out of all of them; because of ANC policy on land, or because of a lack of ANC policy on land...). The forums are intended to allow individuals to express their gripes and feel a part of the organisation again.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The key to the election result may be which party most successfully projects itself as the party of democracy, and the ANC is trying to jump the queue by demonstrating internal democracy at work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At the same time, this process gives ANC leaders a chance to get a feel for the issues that matter most to people.; It has the added advantage of allowing the ANC to start its campaign early without running the danger of exhausting the speech-making potential of its leaders before the climax.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> By all accounts, the meetings have so far been highly successful. The ANC took a risk by starting off in</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Natal a fortnight ago, but the gamble has paid off: in many cases there have been too many people attending with too many issues they want to raise with the leadership -- a problem every politician would like to have.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Having had 14 such meetings in Natal -- with attendance ranging between 200 and 10,000 -- they now plan five or six in the PWV area, two in the Northern Transvaal and one in the OFS. Others will be held without Mandela.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It is a significant sign of ANC priorities that the election strategists made maximum use of Mandela in Natal (eight meetings in one weekend) and are not taking him to the Western Cape at this stage of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC is using its process of drawing up nomination lists and a manifesto as the second phase of the campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normally, such documents are prepared before the campaign and presented as vote-catching tools; the ANC, however, is using the process of drawing up these documents to secure its basic support base.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> At first glance, the elaborate process created to draw up the ANC's election lists over a three-month period seems excessively complex and arcane. But it is a shrewd way of mobilising internal support, involving members and potential members in the process and demonstrating a commitment to democracy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The ANC was presented with a potential nightmare in selecting the 1,050 names it needs for the elections (200 on the national list for the national assembly; 200 on the regional lists for the assembly; about 470 for regional government; and 90 for the senate). It has to balance the conflicting needs of a diverse constituency, including its alliance partners, Cosatu and the Communist Party, and other members of the Patriotic Front, and find a balance of gender, age, race and region. It has to accommodate former guerrillas, exiles, former political prisoners and an old guard in search of pensions -- all of this in a situation where there are hundreds of people competing for what would be well-paid and influential jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The Elections Commission is trying to turn this into a weapon of potential advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It has opened up the process to non-members, by inviting all &quot;mass democratic movement&quot; structures to make nominations, drawing into its ranks potential sources of dissidence and dissatisfaction. So even some Azapo members have been nominated, ensuring that people who may otherwise be drawn away by far left organisations are kept within the fold.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Anyone can be nominated, and some surprises are expected, though those nominated will be obliged, if elected, to join the ANC and sub;it to caucus discipline.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The names that come forward will be sorted by a special committee to ensure that the list is properly representative, all the candidates meet the legal requirements and the 30 percent quota of women is fulfilled. These names will then be put to regional votes which will determine the order of the list. The final say rests with the National Executive Committee, but it may only change the order of names; it may not add or remove candidates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The regional meetings will also debate the manifesto being drafted by the Elections Commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> This elaborate process ensure that while there is wide participation, there is also a measure of control over the outcome. But, because the powers of the special committee and the NEC are carefully proscribed, the potential for conflict is limited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The whole procedure is begin overseen by the Independent Mediation Services of South Africa. It climaxes with the national congress on January 7, the ANC's 82nd birthday, when the list, the manifesto and the reconstruction accord will be finalised. -30- Reprinted from WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN, November 26 to December 2, 1993.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Leading figures in the Inkatha Freedom Party are thinking the unthinkable. They are not ruling out the possibility of contesting next April's election without Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But they insist this eventuality -- the political equivalent of Hamlet without the prince -- is unlikely to happen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Speculation has been fueled by two developments this week. At an IFP rally in Durban on Monday, Buthelezi warned he would resign as president if a planned special IFP conference voted down his rejectionist stance on elections. It was the third time he has made this threat this year.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And in Washington, Buthelezi's former close associate and past Inkatha general secretary Oscar Dhlomo said he thought the IFP leader might soon retire from public life and leave his party to fight elections without him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dhlomo, who quit his Inkatha post in 1990 and now heads the Institute for Multiparty Democracy, reportedly said it was not in Buthelezi's nature to participate in a process he had so vehemently opposed. At the same time, many rising IFP leaders were keen to fight the elections, and tensions were simmering in the organisation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In an interview, IFP national spokesman Ziba Jiyane said he expected the IFP to survive even if Buthelezi stepped down as its leader at a special general conference to be help either next month or early next year. However, for this to happen, Buthelezi would have to give the party his blessing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Jiyane said that while he respected Dhlomo's view, as he had &quot;knowledge&quot; of Buthelezi, he did not agree with his assessment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> It was unlikely that the special general conference of the IFP would go against Buthelezi's wish to boycott the April poll.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Chief Buthelezi is very popular in the IFP. Nobody can conceivably challenge his leadership,&quot; Jiyane added.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers believe that IFP moderates, who want the IFP to fight the election, may attempt to strengthen their hand through internal elections for a new central committee. Jiyane said that the IFP planned to hold elections for its leadership structures at branch and provincial level.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> And although only the IFP annual general conference can elect a new central committee in terms of the constitution, the organisation will &quot;consider&quot; holding elections for the central committee at the special general conference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers point out that the IFP has not help central committee elections for the last five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Buthelezi appointed his closest confidant, Walter Felgate, to the central committee. If elections are held, IFP moderates could try to oust him, paving the way for then to increase their influence over the IFP president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Dhlomo -- a former right-hand man of the IFP chief -- said he believed Buthelezi would consider retirement more seriously if he was given assurances that he would be left in peace and given recognition for his role in the liberation struggle.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;For Buthelezi to participate in the transitional executive council and government of national unity after his determined opposition to every aspect of the transitional arrangements would be a humiliating climbdown which, as I know him, he would find hard to swallow.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Through his consistent stand, he may be preparing quietly to make his exit from political life,&quot; said Dhlomo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> There is little prospect, however, of IFP moderates seeking to oust Buthelezi. Besides his overwhelming personal hold on the party machine, the IFP's support among both rural blacks and whites in Natal largely depends on him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Observers believe that possible successors to Buthelezi are IFP national chairman Frank Mdlalose, or kwaZulu government chief negotiator Ben Ngubane. Jiyane -- a former exiled leader of the Pan Africanist Congress -- stands an outside chance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Since he joined the party early this year, he has had a meteoric rise in the IFP, begin its constitutional adviser at the World Trade Center Talks and later appointed as its media spokesman and national political director.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> He also serves on the IFP election commission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> IFP moderates are keeping their options open with some even considering the possibility of breaking away from the IFP to form a new party with disaffected Nats.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> On Marine patrol in the streets of Mogadishu, the radio crackled to</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">life inside the column's command vehicle: &quot;Downtown Six! Downtown Six!&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Capt. Bob Castellvi diverted his armored convoy to a private house where an American had just received death threats and needed protection.  &quot;It's probably some (spy) or a State Department type,&quot; mused Castellvi, 30, as he wheeled his light armored vehicle into action near the U.S. Embassy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The mystery house turned out to be a compound rented by ABC-TV. The complaint was made by &quot;Nightline&quot; host Ted Koppel. The man in danger was Said Samatar, a Somali-born professor of African history from Rutgers University, whom ABC had hired as a consultant.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Samatar, Koppel and a camera crew piled into Castellvi's armored vehicle, which was getting crowded. It might have been a metaphor for the media offensive in Somalia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Who are you?&quot; demanded Koppel, when he saw another passenger taking notes, wedged in among the Marines in the crew.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;I'm from the Chicago Tribune. I'm spending the day with these Marines. Some of them are from Chicago. I can't believe this. Media people are falling all over each other on this story. You can't even go on a secret rescue mission without stumbling into other reporters.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Koppel smiled in agreement. Then he interviewed the Chicago reporter to that effect on camera. Then the reporter interviewed Koppel about his endangered consultant, who sat sheepishly on an ammunition crate as the windowless vehicle rumbled along en route to Mogadishu International Airport and a secure flight home to the Rutgers campus in Newark, NJ.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;A high-level source in Somalia, someone whose word we trust, told us this man's life had been threatened, and we are taking it seriously,&quot; Koppel said. So ABC had called the Marines.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this civil-war-ravaged country, where more than 300,000 people have starved to death, hundreds of reporters were on hand to cover the mercy mission of thousands of foreign soldiers trying to provide security and food relief in Operation Restore Hope.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> A Study in Excess. After the first month, the bulk of the reporters gave up on the story and moved on. Most pulled out after President George Bush's New Year's visit, but only after astonishing a starved and strapped Somalia with excess.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> They shone TV lights in the camouflage-streaked faces of Marines hitting the beaches. They brought noisy electrical generators and erected a forest of satellite dishes on the roof of a makeshift hotel. They rented houses, chartered airplanes, sent in their most senior anchors and spent millions of dollars on coverage as sporadic gunfire rattled the nation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Koppel, Dan Rather of CBS and Christiane Amanpour of CNN were among those doing standups from the roof of the Mogadishu airport terminal as Marines splashed ashore in the background.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tom Brokaw and NBC had taken over much of the space at the only functioning hotel in Mogadishu, a three-story building with 58 rooms dubbed the Sahafi (&quot;journalist&quot; in Arabic) Hotel by its enterprising Somali owner, Mohamed Jirdeh Hussein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> From its rooftop, wide microwave dishes yawned skyward toward satellites over the Indian Ocean. Primitive refugee huts covered with green plastic climbed a nearby hillside, forming a poignant backdrop for TV reports, along with the gunfire.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The distinctive stench of the dead, buried in shallow graves that marched sadly down the slope, wafted daily over the dusty road toward the hotel, suspended in the searing equatorial air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Up the street, inside a walled compound, CBS had the rarest of</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">things in Somalia: an air-conditioned suite of offices. It was converted to a bureau and packed with food, fruit, supplies and equipment. CBS reportedly put down a $17,000 deposit for the house. The New York Times paid $12,000 for one month's rent for another house.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Farther on was the spacious ABC operation, another group of buildings in a compound guarded by a retinue of local Somali employees, not far from the U.S. Embassy. CNN also set up a private, well-stocked, impromptu bureau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> What Famine? This media assault on Somalia was among the most bizarre spectacles of the television age, but covering Somalia has generally been an odd experience for journalists for a host of reasons, ranging from the availability of food and supplies in a country with seemingly little of both, to the red-carpet treatment given the press by the U.S. military, to the constant dangers of looting and robbery, leading journalists to hire armed bodyguards to protect them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Despite widespread famine, the Sahafi provided meals of all kinds for paying guests, ranging from pasta and salad to rice and meat dishes for lunch or dinner. There were eggs, bread with butter and jam, or rolls with mangoes and coffee at breakfast.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Because the famine in Mogadishu was created by warlords hoarding food and controlling its flow to the city's markets, there was plenty of food for those few who had money.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The media grew to depend on resourceful people like hotelier Hussein, who charged by the bed ($85 a night). He could always change dollars quickly into Somali shillings and tell guests where to buy things or get their laundry done in a day -- even in chaotic, war-blasted Mogadishu, where there are no banks or cleaners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> In this powerless capital he kept gasoline-powered electrical generators running around the clock to light the hotel. This kept journalists, their laptop computers and their satellite telephones in business when darkness fell everywhere else.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Military, media team up. The media and the military have enjoyed unusually good relations during Operation Restore Hope, especially compared with relations during other recent U.S. combat operations, from Grenada to Panama to the Persian Gulf.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> The U.S. military in Somalia was so helpful, harried journalists grew to depend on U.S. troops for occasional rides, rations, and refills of canteens and water bottles. Navy medics advised news gatherers on everything from sunblock and heat exhaustion to diarrhea and drug-resistant forms of malaria in East Africa.  And members of the U.S.-led military contingent occasionally came to the aid of journalists when gangs tried to rob them or, in one instance in Bardera, surrounded their compound.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> American forces even allowed journalists to check their guards' guns at the gates when entering a secured base or airport.  Upon leaving,</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">exchanges like this were common:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Hello, staff sergeant, could I please have the Chicago Tribune's gun?  It's a Soviet 7.62 mm pistol with 'CCCP' on the handle. Here's my card.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;Here you go, sir,&quot; a Marine would respond, emerging from a guardhouse with the weapon and the removed ammunition clip. &quot;Please wait until you're outside the perimeter before putting the clip back in.&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Normally, any media use of guards with guns would be a topic of hot debate and ethical soul-searching. Most professional foreign correspondents are adamant about never taking sides or carrying weapons. Packing a pistol can give the wrong appearance, as if one has become a combatant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But such discussions were short-lived in Somalia, where private relief agencies, and even the United Nations, have been operating for months by hiring armed Somali guards. Tribune photographer Chris Walker realized that need when he was accosted one day by two men brandishing AK-47 assault rifles and motioning for him to turn over his cameras. The Tribune's interpreter, Abdul Rahman Abukar, 27, leapt from the paper's car, pulled out his small pistol and made the would-be robbers back down.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> But even as Abukar covered the two men with his pistol, another man reached into the car and stole Walker's camera bag. Out sprang the Tribune's driver, Aden Hassan Ali, 20, another honest Somali tired of the looters ruling his country, who struggled with the thief, retrieved the bag and returned it to Walker.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Not everyone survived such acts of bravery. Ali Ibrahim Mursal, 37, chief driver for the Associated Press, was killed January 5 defending three AP staff members in Mogadishu's main market.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> When a robber tried to rip a gold chain off the neck of one of the three AP staff members, Mursal jumped on the thief's back. But another thug put the muzzle of an AK-47 in Mursal's back and pulled the trigger. He died in surgery hours later at Digfer Hospital.  *</SPAN></P>
