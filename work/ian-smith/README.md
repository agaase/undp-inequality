#Title:Is the Rapid Growth of Urban African Cities a Sign of Prosperity or Imbalance?
###Lead text:> The visualization analyzes the role that infrastructure and agriculture play in making an urban city livable and a place of opportunity. At the most basic level, a city must have food and power to sustain itself; The amount of food imported by a country and the amount of agricultural land is compared to each country’s inequality coefficient (Gini) and the country’s urban population living in a “slum”.

##So do African Cities have the Agricultural resources available? If so are investments being made to develop them? Is this even true?
>I am studying power grid infrstructure and agriculture because I want to find out who/why/how it is that there are regions without access to electricity and who/why/how Africa imports food. I do so in order to understand how/why/what governments are spending money on if not this. I am considering/comparing/using financial and economic variables such as government debt and expenditure. My visualization is based on WorldBank world development indicators data.


###Questions 

	-Is there any clear indications as to whether the "lack of strong statistical systems in most African countries" mentioned in the "Overview of Key Issues report" is more heavily rooted in infrastructural or institutional weaknesses?

	-I know banking penetration in Africa is quite low when compared on a global scale, and the 2 main reasons cited for this are low income in general, and distance to financial institutions. What about financial markets? and stock markets. Is there an equivalent of "Wall Street" in Africa?

	-I heard of this interesting theory that since Africa is so infrastructurally barren in many regards, it might be able to sort of "skip over" intermediary infrastructural stages and the accompanying lag associated with the adoption of new technologies. For example mobile/online banking, UAV's, etc. Do you see any merit or potential in this line of thinking? If so, what would you say would be the biggest obstacles for something like this? If not, why not?
