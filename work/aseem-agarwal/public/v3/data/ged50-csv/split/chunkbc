A bomb explosion, which took place on a racecourse in Nalchik, killed one and injured twenty people.

""Having an experience of work in the law-enforcement agencies, I am convinced that this was a direct attempt on the life of the head of the republic, Arsen Kanokov - the main guarantor of stability in the Kabarda-Balkaria Republic,"" the website quoted Shkhagoshev as saying.

He noted that President Kanokov traditionally attended horse races on 1 May every year and that whoever conceived the terrorist act, had assumed that he would attend this year as well. He added that the time-bomb had been installed on the VIP lounge.

""This terrorist attack, just like the explosion of a patrol car in the Kabarda-Balkaria capital two days ago, is the work of badly organized groups. These separate provocative attacks do not have either former force or support now. 'Guerrilla' warfare has been declared on the law-enforcement agencies, to which our law enforcement bodies are not ready,"" the MP said, calling on citizens of the republic to demonstrate ""vigilance and right understanding"" of the situation.

In the meantime, editor-in-chief of the Caucasus Times website, Islam Tekushev, said that the terrorist attack had been carried out by the North Caucasus underground, the so called Kabarda-Balkaria sector of the Caucasus emirate.","1","Nalchik","city of Nalchik,","Kabardino-Balkaria","Nalchik municipality","43.4846","43.6071","POINT (43.607100 43.484600)","191968","Russia (Soviet Union)","Europe","1","1","2010-05-01","2010-05-01","0","0","1","0","1","1","1","SUN","365","RUS"

An employee of the Ingush Emergencies Ministry has been shot dead by unidentified assailants in Nazran, corporate-owned Interfax agency reported on 8 October.

A representative for the directorate of the Investigations Committee under the Russian prosecutor's office (SKP) for Ingushetia said that the incident occurred at 1730 Moscow time (1330 gmt) on Ulitsa Yuzhnaya (street) in the municipal district of Nasyr-Kort in Nazran.

TD 
 

""According to preliminary information, the people who attacked the Emergencies Ministry employee fled from the scene after the shooting. The Emergencies Ministry employee was taken to hospital; however, he died from his injuries without regaining consciousness,"" the SKP representative said.

A ""Perekhvat"" (interception) plan has been introduced in Nazran, aimed at searching for and detaining the attackers.

The republic's law-enforcement agencies told Interfax that the victim - the head of the fire-fighting service of the main directorate of the Emergencies Ministry for Ingushetia - was shot from an automatic weapon when he was driving up to his house in his own car. State news agency RIA Novosti identified the deceased as 47-year-old Daud Yevloyev.

In another incident in Ingushetia, in the village of Yandar in Nazranovskiy District, employees of the Federal Security Service (FSB) directorate and the Interior Ministry found and destroyed a cache containing over 50 kg of explosives.

""In the course of searches in one of the village's private house, a cache with explosive substances equivalent to over 50 kg of TNT was found. In connection with the threat of detonation of the ammunition during neutralization, the decision was taken to render the charges safe by means of an explosion,"" a source in the press service of the FSB directorate for Ingushetia told Interfax, noting that no-one was hurt during the neutralization.

According to the FSB's information, the explosives were intended for large-scale terrorist acts on the territory of the Russian Federation.

Meanwhile, police in Chechnya's Groznenskiy District have detained a suspected militant accomplice in the village of Kerla-Yurt, a source in the law-enforcement agencies told Interfax on the same day.

""On Ulitsa Alkhanchurtskaya [street], police employees detained at his place of residence a militant accomplice, who during the period of 2003-2004 kept weapons and ammunition for members of S. Arsanukayev's bandit group,"" the source said.

The source also reported that in the town of Argun on Ulitsa Krupskaya (street), an unemployed man was detained at his place of residence; 329 cartridges of 5.45-mm calibre cartridges were found in the house and seized.

MOSCOW, September 2 (RIA Novosti) – An insurgent fighter killed by security forces in the North Caucasian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria Saturday night was preparing a major terrorist attack, according to the press service of the regional Interior Ministry.

Local authorities said the victim, who was killed after opening fire at a checkpoint when police attempted to inspect his car, was carrying a time bomb made of various chemicals mixed in a bucket and connected to a Casio watch.

“The power of the explosives was estimated to be 15 kilograms of TNT. Specialists believe there is no doubt that a terror attack was being prepared,” the press release said.

The bomb was defused on the spot, and police also found a machine gun and pistol, but without ammunition.

A low-intensity Islamic insurgency has plagued the volatile North Caucasus region in recent years.
